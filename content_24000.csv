They both excelled with a bat as well as behind the plate. They both led their teams to greatness (or at least really damn close, in the case of the 1975 Red Sox). 

And, for our purposes, they were both stupendously competitive. Their rivalry was driven by a relentless desire to be the best, and it's what the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry is at its very best.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Daniel Sorian - Hello John my question is,  if Solo is successful and depending how it ends could we see a potential sequel or do you think it’s a one and done type deal. What do you think are the chances?

Vassileios Katsimenis - I am curious...When Luke disappeared there wasn't no mechanic hand left behind,is that a sign that Luke is alive? May be a smart hint for the audience like the no footprints on Crait?? What do you think?

Bill Howsare -  In the Timothy Zahn novels, there was an arc featuring a clone created by Luke's severed hand. Not cannon, I know. But what do you think about the idea of Luke having a clone in ""The Last Jedi"" and that is who we see disappearing/ dying at the end?.

Jessie Martinez - We all talk and joke about the fact that at the end of Star Wars ANH Chewie didn’t get a medal. But all jokes aside, seriously, why didn’t Chewie get a medal? Why have him walk down the aisle with Han and Luke? Did Chewie know he was walking up there just to not get anything? What’s the deal???",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U_afmnaJUHU/hqdefault.jpg,0.03194290465631928,0.004088137472283814,7.813559322033898,0.00873059866962306,0.03603104212860312,0.044761640798226164,2018-04-15,21:49:02,Sunday,6,12,48,12,34,51,330,2,67,1,0,11,13,4,1,3.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.333993970645058,3,"['happy', 'sad', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus, whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus to fight with him on the side of the Gods. Iseult Gillespie shares the myth of Prometheus.

It was Bruno Mars and Cardi B, tearing through the remixed version of the former’s “Finesse,” released just after the new year to widespread acclaim. As soon as it dropped Jan. 4, there was chatter they might perform it together at the Grammys. They certainly did -- in all its brightly-colored, new jack swing glory -- but with added surprise treats. There were furious dance moves and towards the end, Cardi dropped in little of her own recent single, “Bariter Cardi.” Just try and get on their level.

THUNDER TO RELEASE NEW LIVE SET “STAGE” ON MARCH 23rd, 2018 ON earMUSIC.

On 23 March 2018, Thunder will release a brand new live set ‘Stage’ through earMUSIC.  ‘Stage’ features hits from right across the band’s career and includes fan-favourite classics like ‘Backstreet Symphony’, ‘Low Life In High Places’ and ‘Love Walked In’ and brings things right up to date with tracks from the 2017 Top 3 UK Chart Album ‘Rip It Up’, like the storming title track and ‘She Likes The Cocaine’.  

Thunder are of course a noted and globally in demand live act. ‘Stage’ was captured at Cardiff Motorpoint Arena on March 24th 2017 during the UK Tour; the band also played Europe, North America & Asia, across Germany with Alice Cooper, at Planet Rock’s ‘Rockstock’ and are preparing to fly to Japan for some January 2018 dates. This is a band that knows how to rock a crowd!

Frontman Danny Bowes says of the new record, “The ‘Rip It Up’ album was so well received, it was no surprise the tour was brilliant too. We decided to include a Cardiff Motorpoint Arena show on the tour, purely because it was so good when we played there with Journey & Whitesnake in 2013. Capturing it as well turned out to be one of our better decisions, because the resulting film and album are a shining example of an organic ‘coming together’ of fans and a band. We’ve released a few live recordings over the years, but this is most definitely up there with the best of them. We're extremely pleased with it.”

‘Stage’ will be available as a 2CD + Blu-ray, 3LP, DVD, Blu-ray and a Limited Edition Box Set.  The audio-visual formats will feature a host of bonus and interview material, whilst the Limited Edition Box Set will include also boast the full ‘Live At The 100 Club’ set, the ‘29 Minutes Later’ acoustic set [only previously made available as a Record Store Day release], and the documentary film ‘A Difficult Day In January: Thunder In London’.

Since forming in 1989, Thunder have established themselves at the top table of UK rock, notching up some twenty Top Fifty singles and two Gold albums. The band’s sound is a timeless marriage of unforgettable melodies and sheer rock power.  ‘Stage’ shows off not just an amazing catalogue of unforgettable rock hits, but just the sheer live power that Thunder possess.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UahPde6hUtU/sddefault.jpg,0.014651638080277652,0.0004071041734346022,35.98989898989899,0.000563366381419601,0.015058742253712256,0.015622108635131856,2017-12-05,06:18:48,Tuesday,1,8,38,8,33,51,334,2,79,0,1,6,14,3,0,6.0,8.0,['Porn|'],['Porn|'],True,['porn|'],1,1,5,0,0,0,0,5.325757603096936,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

ABOUT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 2:

Journey to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games! Fight alongside unforgettable characters in a stunning new solar system, as you struggle for freedom and the right to determine your own fate among the stars. Play the adventure by yourself or with friends in a vast and seamless online playground.

Beyond Good and Evil 2 is the spiritual successor to the cult classic, a prequel that will transport players into a profoundly multicultural world, capturing the spirit of the original with grandiose decors and intense dramas that play out across a vast universe. Through the Space Monkey Program, Ubisoft Montpellier will be developing the game alongside its community of fans.

System 3 has become the center of interstellar trade and colonization in the Milky Way of the 24th century, thanks to the creation of Hybrid slaves. While private enterprises fight over resources and power, the first colonists weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth to give meaning to their existence. In this new era of piracy, we will rise from lowly pirate to legendary captain at the helm of massive star-faring vessels, adventuring alongside crews of colorful characters to fight for freedom and the right to determine our own fate among the stars!

There was speculation that it would be appearing before the ‘Ready Player One’ film which opens this Wednesday. Wan over three tweets made it clear that he was taking his time in creating a good first teaser trailer. He specified that there was never any plan for the trailer to be included in the package of trailers ahead of ‘Ready Player One’. He explained that there is some special effects and details that he wants to get right before releasing a first trailer of any kind for the much anticipated DCEU film.

Mark Reilly and John Rocha sit down to talk about this news and discuss Wan’s tweets about this possibility. They also speculate on when they think we might be getting a trailer fo the movie this year. They also offer their thoughts on the reasons for why Wan and Warner Bros may want to wait on releasing a trailer. Let us know what you think about what Wan tqweeted and about what Reilly and Rocha thought about this news in the Comments section below.

Officially revealed at the 2018 Detroit Auto Show, this truck is new from hood to hitch. It brings fresh design, more amenities, and greater capability to market than any Ranger that’s come before.

Unlike the previous version, which was really the last true compact pickup on the market, this reborn 2019 model is a midsize truck. Ford is responding to growing customer demand by offering this rig in America.

 Hope you enjoy the  brief outline of the main fashion trends during the Victorian era.
 the footage is mostly time lapse - but dont worry, many of the items will be made into indivudual videos with slower footage and a lot more information and details shown.

The patterns and  instructions on how to make  the dresses shown (and many more, including undergarments....) are included in my book, The Victorian Dressmaker, coming out June 2018!

Since the year 2000, ring-tailed lemur populations on the island have dropped more than 95 percent. Rapid habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade have all contributed to the species’ dramatic decline. Looking to turn things around, a group of local people have banded together to protect their much-loved maki. Due to their hard work, the Anja Community Reserve now boasts the highest density of ring-tailed lemurs in the whole of the island. See the animals at play in their island oasis in this inspiring short film by Robin Hoskyns.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ujv8chXu_dk/sddefault.jpg,0.01523554916004999,0.00011252755646411138,135.3939393939394,0.00040407622548476363,0.0153480767165141,0.015752152941998863,2018-06-12,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,8,37,8,32,53,328,2,76,0,1,7,16,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.856595491203919,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

JinSoul)""

LOOΠΔ [Olivia Hye]

Since the debut of HeeJin in October 2016, LOOΠΔ has finally announced its twelfth member Olivia Hye to complete its line-up.

With the largest scale and the longest period of debut promotion in the K-pop history, LOOΠΔ has been building its own universe carefully to build credibility in the quality of music and the trust in the team among fans.

LOOΠΔ 1/3 has gone around the world to unite the girls, and released 'Love&Live' and 'Love&Evil' to show the process of transformation to explain the universe of LOOΠΔ for the first time. LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE gathered three odd girls to complete a big circle with colors as the central idea.

Last four girls are remaining. Starting with Yves, Chuu and Go Won talk about their ego. The ego is seen as a girl who admires someone, or envies another. Sometimes, it starts from self-loathing or disappointment in oneself.

However, they come to a realization that self-awareness is not decided upon or created by somebody else, but build by oneself by starting to love oneself. With novelty, excitement, and uniqueness. Although it may seem selfish, the process of completing one's ego with loving oneself is captured in the story.

Olivia Hye's titled track 'Egoist’ starts with calm melodies to eventually encounter provocative beats to take a step towards loving oneself instead of someone else. Pop melodies mix with EDM beats to build up until a dramatic fall at the beat drop, which then is brought to salvation by JinSoul's rap.

Also, the music video features Olivia Hye's dynamic movements, along with hidden cuts around the narratives of LOOΠΔ.

Go Won and Olivia Hye's duet 'Rosy' captures the pretty but edgy unpredictable emotions of modern girls who are nice but chic, kind but naughty, or interested but not enough to go out with someone.

After the introduction of its twelfth member Olivia Hye, LOOΠΔ will spend April as the preparation period until the new unit will be unveiled in May. There will also be an event in May with a whole new concept announced for the fans.

If you're new here, I want to welcome you to our little family. You are in an extremely safe place, where we only allow love and compassion.. there is room for opinion, but nobody digs or tolerates hate. So welcome again, know you are safe, loved, and welcomed. We sound like a cult, because we probably are. 

Tonight’s video is a “Sleepy Spa” RP, where you will be personally pampered by a sweet, kind, advice giving therapist/spa person lol. You’ll be given a neck massage to promote blood flow to the face, followed by a towel wrapped around your neck while two masks are applied; one with collagen for under your eyes, one with hyaluronic acid and magnets for the face. But it’s pointed out that you by no means NEED these masks, as it’s simple to see you are BEAUTIFUL the WAY you already are. 

So please.. sit back, relax, and let yourself be pampered! I enjoy making these relaxing RPs, so I hope they give you the tingles!!! Know I LOVE you with ALL of my person, and I’ll see you tomorrow!

In SICARIO, Day of the Soldado, the series begins a new chapter.  In the drug war, there are no rules – and as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists across the US border, federal agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) calls on the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), whose family was murdered by a cartel kingpin, to escalate the war in nefarious ways. Alejandro kidnaps the kingpin’s daughter to inflame the conflict – but when the girl is seen as collateral damage, her fate will come between the two men as they question everything they are fighting for.

Africa’s largest hydroelectric power project is two thirds finished and the dam can already control the flow of the Blue Nile, which is deeply upsetting downstream Egypt who they didn’t consult before building started. In the first part of the BBC News Virtual Reality documentary series “Damming The Nile” you’ll be taken on a journey from the sacred source of the Blue Nile, down waterfalls and through canyons to see this giant dam being built. You’ll travel on East Africa’s first metro train, go for a traditional Ethiopian lunch to hear why people are paying for this multi-billion dollar project, see the extent of Ethiopia’s growth and ambitions, and hear the government’s view on the political crisis the dam project has created.  When finished, watch episode 2.

Spirits stay high as the pounds come off for heavyweight Francis Ngannou and lightweight Eddie Alvarez. It all pays off on Friday morning, when those fighters -- as well as featherweight champion Max Holloway, heavyweight Alistair Overeem and Alvarez' opponent Justin Gaethje -- hit their targets at the official weigh-in. The stars of the main event recover with assorted carbs: spaghetti for Aldo and cupcakes for Holloway. Then it's one more round of posing and staredowns, this time at Little Caesars Arena, where fans turn out for the ceremonial weigh-in. UFC 218 Embedded is an all-access, behind-the-scenes video blog leading up to the featherweight championship rematch at UFC 218 on Saturday, December 2nd on Pay-Per-View.

Hey guys! omggg not gonna lie I was pretty nervous going into this but I knew Mia was an amazing makeup artist and I wanted to see her work her magic on me! Ive only really ever had someone else do my makeup once before years agoooo so I guess this was the first proper time someone has done a full glam look on me and I loved it!! Its definitely alot different to the way I do my own but I like the change! What do you guys think?! Would you like to see more videos like this on my channel? Love you long time x x

Of course there were lots of great Westworld secrets and easter-eggs to discover as well, so join WatchMojo.com as we explore some of the things you may have missed.

The second chapter in Marvel’s Avengers stories was received with mixed reviews from fans and critics, but what did you think? There are so many hidden references to future MCU movies, Phase 2 and 3! We find our main Marvel heroes (Iron Man/Tony Stark, Captain America/Steve Rogers, Hulk/Bruce Banner, Black Widow/Natasha Romanov, Thor/Odinson, and Hawkeye/Clint Barton) taking down Baron Von Strucker and Hydra in Sokovia, but they’re thwarted by two enhanced people/mutants, Quicksilver/Pietro Maximoff and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff.

Tony stumbles upon Loki’s scepter from Avengers 1, and together with Bruce Banner they accidentally create Ultron. Ultron decides to take on the Avengers, team up with the twins, and try to end the world. We meet Ulysses Klaue (who we will see again in Black Panther) and the first introduction of Wakanda, while also getting a Hulk VS Hulkbuster fight!

We’re introduced to Hawkeye’s family on the farm as well as plant seeds for Thor Ragnarok, Captain America Civil War, and other future Marvel films. While we do lose Quicksilver in the fight against Ultron, we do get Vision’s debut in the MCU. Will the Avengers be able to stop Ultron from killing the world? Yes, they can. Cause we’ve all probably seen this movie. But there are still plenty of awesome easter eggs that will blow your mind on the rewatch. See if I missed any and let me know which one’s were your favorite. Let me know down below or on twitter @sambashor!

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uu9g4ESVGCs/sddefault.jpg,0.013976166213768116,0.00022644927536231884,61.71875,0.0006298120471014493,0.014202615489130434,0.014832427536231884,2018-03-06,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,9,37,9,32,54,330,0,76,0,1,8,16,3,0,5.0,8.0,['Porta'],['Porta'],True,['porta'],1,1,5,0,0,0,0,6.348408201260103,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Special thanks to Linas Orentas for his support on my Patreon page!

This lesson walks you through the basics on how to write metal riffs that sound like Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, and other metal classics. By combining our minor scale with two notoriously evil sounding intervals, the flat 2 and the tritone, we get a set of notes that is very easy to compose with in the metal genre.

In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

China has so many amazing street foods to try, and I've been filming and documenting them for you for the past 4 years. In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. 

When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. 

When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

ABOUT THE FOOD RANGER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious .

I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way! Over the next few years, I'm going to travel around the world and document as much food as I can for you! I love delicious food! This channel will show you real Chinese food and real local food, not that stuff they serve in the Buzzfeed challenge.

Claire returns and reunites with Alex Jones (guest star Katherine Ramdeen), who has stayed behind with Jody and tries to balance a “normal” life with being a part time hunter. While Jody is happy to have Claire home again, she’s plagued by Patience’s (guest star Clark Backo) disturbing vision involving her adopted daughter. Claire and Alex search for Kaia Nieves (guest star Yadira Guevara-Prip), the dreamcatcher responsible for opening the rift that Sam and Dean went through, as she holds the key to their whereabouts. Jody calls her friend, Donna Hanscum (guest star Briana Buckmaster), to round out the team and the women head off on the most important hunt of their lives.

Knowing without question that every moment I sunk into loving that band was /worth it/ was really nice...it meant I didn't have to fret about whether I was wasting in my time.

These days, we really REALLY value being able to make our own individual minds up about every single thing, but I kinda miss the days when I could just deeply and suddenly believe that whatever John thought was cool was cool. It was less effort, but also less stressful. I think the way we're living right now is definitely the weird way, and it results in a whole lot of stress and anxiety and maybe sometimes even depression.

I'm not saying we should go back to living in a world where whatever the leader of the tribe said was the thing to do was THE THING TO DO OR YOU DIED. But maybe a little bit more faith in other people's tastes would be a little more relaxing.

OK! Thanks for reading!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show.

Max, cane Rottweiler e il suo partner umano Frank, sono agenti dell’FBI e stanno investigando sul rapimento di un cucciolo di panda da parte di una banda di commercianti illegali di animali. Quando ricevono un indizio sulla vendita del cucciolo di panda a una prestigiosa mostra canina, Max si vedrà costretto a partecipare sotto copertura ad essa per evitare la catastrofe.

Rocketed into a endearing and amusing journey of sexual and self-exploration, Alex ultimately learns that like so much of growing up, love can be confusing. And that's okay.

""For me, I believe that eating regularly throughout the day is unnatural. We are not designed to have full stomachs all the time, and only when we begin to restrict meal frequency - not restricting calories - do we start to tap into those body fat reserves.""

""I often get asked the question: ""how can you continue fasting during the Christmas period?"" or ""Does the way that in I fast change at all?"" And the answer to that question is ""no, nothing changes.""

""I indulge, maybe more frequently than I did previously to Christmas. But on the days that I'm not indulging, I'm still eating two meals a day because this is a way of life.""

VERSE 1:
You met me at the sinners’ table 
I found You waiting by the well 
Unexpected
You are always there
Tracing all my steps

CHORUS:
Light up the way of Your heart
Move me like You do the mountains
Move me like You do the wind
And I'll chase Your voice through the dark 
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of Your shadow-step
(Take another step)

VERSE 2:
You never left the lost forsaken 
Your mercy paves the road ahead 
Unexpected
You are always good
You are always good

CHORUS:
Light up the way of Your heart
Move me like You do the mountains
Move me like You do the wind
And I'll chase Your voice through the dark 
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of Your shadow-step
(Take another step)

POST CHORUS:
And I won't be afraid
In every way
You never fail
So have Your way here God 
And I’ll sing Your praise
Fix my heart to Yours
Ready for the unexpected 
Ready for what You will do next

BRIDGE:
I can’t explain Your heart
Or dare to trace-out all You are
But when I think about
The road You took for love
I know Your grace will stay the path

A BIT ABOUT MY CHANNEL:
I'm a working mom of two who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and like most women, trying to have it all. I'm a mama 24/7, work a full-time job Monday-Friday, and a Youtuber on the weekends and evenings after the kiddos go to sleep. I make content to empower others, share fun information, and unleash some of my creativity. On this channel you'll find mommy and lifestyle videos, shopping hauls, cleaning and organization, home decor, holiday and party decorations, boss lady tips and advice, and some style and beauty videos sprinkled into the mix. xoxo

A BIT ABOUT ME:
I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. I attended Ohio University, where I acquired a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism, and a master's degree in communication. From there, I joined Teach For America and taught 7th grade English in Baltimore, MD. I moved home to Cleveland to marry my husband, and have worked in a variety of roles in recruitment and HR. I currently manage a recruitment team, where I work from home when I'm not traveling for my job. I have two babies- my son Landon is two years old, and my daughter Presley is three months old. I love being a mommy, decorating our home, planning parties, shopping, working out, cooking, cleaning, and meeting new people. I'm a bit obsessed with leopard print, wine, coffee, and reality TV shows. I am very passionate about helping others, and ensuring the world is a better place, especially when it comes to our children.

They had released a trailer for the film during the game teasing the fans' interest. Directed by Julius Onah and starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, David Oyelowo and Daniel Brühl, the film focuses on a ship orbiting a planet on the brink of war. The scientists on board test a device to solve an energy crisis, and end up face-to-face with a dark alternate reality.

Dennis Tzeng and Perri Nemiroff are here to offer their thoughts on the film. They give you their overall impression of this move by Netflix. They also explore the merits and flaws of the film and if it's a worthy successor to the previous two Cloverfield movies.

  For a long time, the athletes that would become the biggest stars in professional wrestling would be those that were the best on the microphone. As MMA has continued to grow in the past decade, the same holds true for their stars. The better you are at being a villain, the more fans will pay to see you fight. Conor McGregor without a doubt is the greatest example, he has brought trash talking to new heights which made him the richest MMA fighter and one of the most popular athlete today. Lately, some of the fighters are trying so hard getting to that spot by trying to act like McGregor.

Lyrics:
Count on your friends
To say i’m a mess 
Oh no

It’s easy to say 
When they got their interests 
Oh yes 

Spending all my money
We’re broke but we still party

I Think I could love somebody like 
Youoooooo 

When you look my way 
I want you to say
Just don’t throw it away 
You’ll be breaking my heart if you don’t stay

Don’t let it go 
speed it up or go slow 
I already know 
You’ll be breaking my heart if you don’t say 

When I go away 
You make me pay 
Oh ya 

But i don’t control
Where our lives go
Oh no

Don’t give me a reason 
To hold back all my feelings 
For you ooo ooo ooo 

I don’t need a reason 
To be feeling what i’m feeling I just do

Spending all my money
We’re broke but we still party
I Think I could love somebody like 
Youoooooo

When you look my way 
I want you to say
Just don’t throw it away 
You’ll be breaking my heart if you don’t stay

Don’t let it go 
speed it up or go slow 
I already know 
You’ll be breaking my heart if you don’t say

Don’t give me a reason to be holding back my feelings for you 
Cos I don’t need a reason to be feeling what I’m feeling I just do

Don’t be lonely cause, you’re not alone 
gotta send me pictures, save em to my roll 
If i fly to see you, would it feel like home?

I decided to be open and share one of my professional failures to show you how I learned to deal with them and grow from it! This is obviously not about Victoria’s secret- it’s about learning how to be confident, kind to yourself and wiser. Sometimes we are our own enemy- as I was in this specific case! We are 100% responsible for our own happiness and progress!

When I talk about these subjects of self love and learning to embrace yourself and become the best version of yourself- it all comes from different experiences I had both professionally and personally that taught me a thing or two about falling and getting back up.
I hope this story of mine with getting rejected by victoria's secret will teach you a thing or two and hopefully you'll learn that failure depends on how you view life, the lessons you take from it and how you come back after!

Lots of love,
V

G-Force, Jerk, and Passing Out In A Centrifuge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMKcO-T5Y4o

And the Starrship team talk about how to avoid G-LOC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tql0glKUVIM


FAQs:

* Isn't 3.6g a really low g-tolerance? *
Yep. Turns out I would not qualify to be a fighter pilot. The average range for g-tolerance is 4-6; no-one was expecting me to pass out. The centrifuge team do not deliberately try to G-LOC people! To be fair, though, I'd done a few earlier runs with only minor effects.

* What g was the RAF person at the start pulling? *
That's Marcus, from the Starrship team, and he was successfully pulling 6.5g with the help of g-trousers: they plug into a compressed air source in the plane (and in the centrifuge) and act as a lower-body tourniquet to keep the blood up top. They are very effective.

* Why did you shake and shudder when regaining consciousness? *
Those are called ""myoclonic convulsions"", which is a fancy medical term for ""muscle jerks"", and they're a common side effect of recovering from G-LOC.

* What did it feel like? *
I don't remember it. I was doing the breathing maneuver, then everything was wobbly, then we were stopped!

* Is this a sponsored video? *
No: the RAF and Starrship had no editorial control over this, and no money changed hands. Obviously, though, they gave me a spin in the centrifuge, and I'm collaborating with them over on their channel too!

THANKS TO:
The RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, the Starrship team, and the folks at Qinetiq for making this happen.

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

What is Lucid Dreaming? Lucid dreaming (sometimes called astral projection although they're not quite the same) is the ability to become SELF AWARE in your dreams, meaning you can control them and experience whatever you want. You can live out your fantasies and be, do, see or feel ANYTHING.

There are also many benefits to lucid dreaming, such as improved sleep, more energy, more confidence, and more restorative sleep. Not to mention the fact you can become more CONSCIOUS, and experience the impossible! 

I'm Stef, the guy behind HowToLucid, and I'm dedicated to helping you learn how to lucid dream. I've been lucid dreaming for over 8 years now and I have a passion for dreams, personal development and travel. Follow my journey, and please leave a comment now, if you've read all of this, letting me know your best lucid dream experience!

If you want to know how to lucid dream tonight or really quickly, check out my other videos on my channel. I have tutorials on how to induce lucid dreams easily and sleep better. Explore lucid dreaming with me!

In a separate, independent analysis, NOAA found that 2017 was the third-warmest year in their record. The difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement. Global temperatures in 2017 were second only to 2016, which still holds the record for the hottest year. However, 2017 was the warmest year without an El Niño.

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A FINANCIAL EXPERT - ALWAYS CHECK WITH ONE BEFORE INVESTING. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. NO FINICAL ADVICE IS BEING GIVEN HERE.

I have 2 goals for this video: 

1. Simplify cryptocurrency for beginners — SO many people in comments are confused. This is NOT a comprehensive guide or where I try to impress you by knowing everything. This is for beginners and people who are interested. Doesn’t have to be complicated just like you can flip on a light switch without knowing ACDC currents work. 

2. Encourage you to open the door to researching/investing. Don’t be too scared of the unknown. You WILL miss this opportunity since it’s so time sensitive.

1. Buy an hold
my strategy (hedge against inflation)(Warren Buffet made his fortune buying and HOLDING not buying and day trading like crazy)

2. Initial Coin offerings
How to get risky with it
Potential upside is MASSIVE

3. Trade actively 
Mostly ALT coins to make money
Hard to do with big coins

4. Bitcoin Lending
I won’t go into this — it looks like a scam
they claim 1% interest per day.
just seems sketchy, but people ARE making money this way
Again, I wouldn’t do this but I put it here in case you want to do your own research

5. Talk about bitcoin
Half joking…. but sign up with my affiliate link :)
Seriously, there is so much miss information out there
EASY for you to immerse yourself into this and become an authority
I’m NOT trying to be the bitcoin dude. 
Just love this stuff.

stop settling start living

She boxes and jumps rope in her normal workout routine so she was very keen to put on some house music and show us her killer rope training skills. Kitted out in an Agent Provocateur swimsuit.
 
“I really loved the boxing gym theme for this year because it was such a sexy and playful idea and working with Phil was great. I usually train jumping rope, so I really got into it and turned it into a real workout—even showing off my moves a few times! :-) I was really sweating and that was me making the dust fly. It was a great fun.”

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches.

[JEONG SEWOON]
 
The first mini album part 2 ‘AFTER’ is the second episode of the glittering growing story of Jeong Sewoon from a boy. The title track ‘BABY IT'S U’ has an attractive composition by warming up with acoustic ballad and leading to an exciting hook without a break that makes you dance. Like the singer, who looks more attractive over time, the song sounds more attractive over time. The listeners can find his charm who sings the song alone till the end sometimes with tension and sometimes explosively. Producer KIGGEN, who appeared on ‘Produce 101’ and worked with Jeong Sewoon in part 1, produced the song in a perfect harmony with Jeong Sewoon.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Giovanni Conti - I read that the new tracking numbers for Black Panther are now around $170 million! This is clearly a big jump over the initial numbers of $120 million. Do you think it could exceed even those numbers and maybe become only the 5th movie to cross a $200 million opening weekend? How crazy would that be?! Thanks and 
pace mio fratello italiano!

Allan Covarrubias - I just finished watching Molly's Game. I was interested in ""Player X"",  I discovered it was Tobey Maguire.  My  opinion on Mr. Maguire has changed drastically for the worse.  My question is does Molly's Game change your view on Tobey Maguire? I love your work and keep bringing the filthy!

Frank Gilbert - I was a big fan of the mini series “V” and it’s subsequent one season series. I was reading recently that the original creator has a film series in the works. I’m not sure if this is real or fake but the article I was reading was from screen rant. I was just wondering if you thought it would be possible for this franchise to work on the big screen after the recent tv reboot failed.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VEZ3XZBGcmU/hqdefault.jpg,0.038741367212024966,0.0017357905233223768,22.3191489361702,0.009786904014477231,0.04047715773534735,0.050264061749824576,2018-02-13,17:16:08,Tuesday,1,12,13,12,13,71,105,1,28,0,2,11,9,2,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.17537391004385,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

From its beginnings in Mesoamerica all the way up to Swiss inventors tinkering away with it in cottages in the Alps.

Fuel for the Aztec and European war machines, a catalyst for massive industrial innovation and a tasty treat adored by chocoholics across the globe. It was enjoyed by powerful Emperor’s on both sides of the Atlantic and filled the pockets of enterprising missionaries. With its roots as a spicy and fatty drink in ancient Mesoamerica, how did chocolate eventually become the guilty pleasure of billions?

Por su parte, Melissa Leo (La mujer más odiada de Estados Unidos, Snowden) y Bill Pullman (La batalla de los sexos, Independence Day: Contraataque) regresan en sus papeles de Susan y Brian Plummer, la pareja de ex-agentes de la CIA retirados. Además, se unen al reparto Pedro Pascal (Kingsman: El círculo de oro, La gran muralla) que dará vida al líder de una banda del crimen organizado, y Ashton Sanders (Moonlight, Straight Outta Compton), el joven que se convertirá en aprendiz del agente Robert McCall.

Read About the Science of Pacific Rim on WIRED:

How the Jaegers in Pacific Rim Uprising Violate Physics
https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-jaegers-in-pacific-rim-uprising-violate-physics/

How Would You Carry a Jaeger From Pacific Rim?
https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-would-you-carry-a-jaeger-from-pacific-rim/

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM LEGENDARY PICTURES: 

#42 What do Jaegers eat?
Jaegers don’t eat, but they are powered by a range of energy sources both digital and analog, harnessed into power cores. Nuclear vortex turbines, supercell chambers, stun cores, and collision chambers are just a few of the many various power cores that energize Jaegers.

#38 What are Jaegers made of?
A wide range of metals are used in the construction of Jaegers including but not limited to steel, iron, brass, obsidian alloys, and much more.

#37 In Pacific Rim about how many feet tall were the Jaegers?
Jaegers vary in height but most are within a range of approximately 250 feet to 300 feet tall.

#35 Are the game grumps going to be in PAC RIM?
As great as they were in Pacific Rim – Training Day, sadly they will not be appearing in the film.

#34 Where do Kaiju come from?
The Kaiju are sent to Earth from the Anteverse, which is the nexus between dimensions – a unique space that exists beyond all dimensions.

#32 Are the Kaiju actually a metaphor for describing sea level rise and the risks of global climate change?
There is a long history in pop culture of monsters embodying the fears of their age. The Kaiju in Pacific Rim are no different.

#24 How many Kaiju are there?
To date, dozens of Kaiju have breached our world, but there could be infinitely more being created in the Anteverse. 

#22 Are Kaiju dinosaurs Pacific Rim? 
There are many theories on the Kaiju and the Precursors that are still unproven, including several on a possible link to the dinosaurs. The PPDC is constantly conducting multiple studies to hopefully reveal more secrets from the Anteverse.

#21 How do Jaegers stand in water?
As long as the Jaeger has a solid seabed to walk on, it can function upright in the sea. Most Jaegers are built to function fully submerged in water as well.

#20 What is Kaiju blue?
Kaiju Blue is the potentially lethal condition that humans can develop from exposure to Kaiju blood. Because of this, Kaiju blood itself (or more specifically the toxic element within it) has also become synonymous with Kaiju Blue.

#19 How much would it cost to build a Jaeger from Pacific Rim?
Depending on the size, Mark, and armaments various Jaegers have been known to range in cost from approximately $80 billion USD to $105 billion USD.

#15 Are Godzilla and Pacific Rim related?
Godzilla and Pacific Rim do not take place in the same universe, but wouldn’t that be cool?

#14 Was Godzilla a Kaiju?
Kaiju is defined as ‘strange beast’, so in that sense Godzilla is indeed a kaiju. However, the similarity to Pacific Rim’s Kaiju ends there.

#10 How are Jaegers named?
A Jaeger’s name is its official military call sign, decided by the PPDC Shatterdome where it is launched. The name is chosen to embody the power and personality of the Jaeger and acts as a symbol of hope for all it defends.

#8 Why did the Kaiju want Newt? 
In the first film, Newt drifted with a Kaiju brain, connecting his mind to the hive mind of the Precursors. When the Kaiju attacked Hong Kong, they were attracted to him like a moth to a flame.

From the tatami room to the kitchen and dining room, this is the story of the Ryokan. 

After 20 years living in Japan, a Ryokan stay is the most authentic experience one can have traveling the country and Fukushima, Japan's third largest prefecture, is famous for that countryside charm and service found around its mountains. It's only a 75 minute Shinkansen train ride from Tokyo making it an ideal getaway from more crowded spots like Nikko and Hakone. In this video, you will see exactly what you will get from start to finish. 

As Japan moves closer to the 2020 Olympics, services are catering more to international visitors and these hotels featured are all accommodating and friendly places, staff learning English to communicate with people from around the world. 

▶︎ What is Kaiseki Ryori / Cuisine?

It's a traditional Japanese dinner with many courses including a starter, soup, side items, main course and dessert. 
★ Sashimi / Sushi
★ Sukiyaki
★ Yakiniku
★ Tempura
★ Miso Soup
It's all here, and it's all prepared with local ingredients of the season, always freshly made in the kitchen.

▶︎ How much is a night at a Ryokan / Traditional Japanese Inn?

It is usually charged by the person instead of the room because it includes 2 meals, dinner and breakfast. On average, I have spent between 12,000 yen ($100) to 22,000 ($180) per person for a night and here is why it is worth it. 
Of all the experiences you will have in Japan, this will be the one you remember the most, dressing in a cotton kimono (yukata) to walk down to dinner, bathing outdoors in a hot spring in the snow, extraordinary Japanese service, amazingly beautiful meals ... you're paying for an experience not just a stay.

This is one of MANY positive adoption stories out there and I hope it helps inspire my fellow adoptees to stay strong in your search. I found my birth mother 10 years ago and it took me another decade before I was able to find my birth father. It is not always an easy journey, but today it's a thousand times more likely that your dreams will come true than ever before thanks to DNA testing. 

I sent my DNA off to both 23andMe and Ancestry to find my birth father with ZERO information about him. If you're interested, you can get your own DNA kit here (my special referral links):

♥ 23andMe DNA Kit: https://refer.23andme.com/s/michellecehn
♥ Ancestry DNA Kit: http://refer.dna.ancestry.com/s/michellecehn

You just spit in a tube, mail it in, and in a few weeks you'll get your results and instantly be connected to hundreds or even thousands of family members (distant cousins and beyond). If you're lucky, you might get some close and very helpful matches! For me, one day a 1st cousin match popped up and I was able to figure it out from there. And if not, you'll still learn a lot about yourself and where you come from geographically. 

I also want to share that my entire experience as an adopted child has been amazing. I always knew I was adopted, and loved that unique little fact about myself. I truly have the best parents in the world and I'm so grateful for the path I got to go down in my life because my birth mother had the courage to do what was best for me. 

I grew up not knowing a single person who was related to me by blood. I had a single photograph of my birth mother and her name, and zero information about my biological father, who never knew I was born. I have always had a hunger to know my birth parents, and ever since I was a little girl I wondered if I might have siblings somewhere out there. 

It's crazy that now, just a few weeks after I wasn't sure if I'd ever find my biological father, I have met, hugged, and hung out with nearly my entire blood family. I know that as an adopted child, knowing your birth family is not something you take for granted. If you get even a glimpse of where you came from, you are incredibly lucky. So right now, I feel like the luckiest person in the world. 

To my mom, my dad, my birth parents, and my entire huge ever-growing family, I love you to pieces and can't wait for all the adventures that lie ahead. 

And to all the adoptees, parents of adopted kiddos, and birthparents watching, don't hesitate to reach out if you need support. I'm here for you!

#AdoptionIsAwesome

UPDATE: It's with the deepest heartbreak that I share that my birth father (b'pa) Greg Hicks passed away suddenly, and unexpectedly in November, 2019. Just a few months before the birth of his grandson. We had the most intense, incredible, connected two years together and could not have made more of every moment we had together since connecting. I put together a memorial video in case you want to see all that adoption reunions can be: https://youtu.be/6PCo76yjTPE

The film from Disney and Marvel stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Letitia Wright, Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Sterling K. Brown, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. The film is a revolutionary superhero film in so many ways. It tackles social and racial politics. It proudly presents black women in ways they’ve never been seen onscreen. And it focuses almost exclusively on Africa and the rich cultural tradition of that continent. The film centers on T’Challa, who after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king.

John Rocha sits down with Joelle Monique and RB3 to get their thoughts on the revolutionary aspects of the movie. They explore what affected them the most and what spoke to them intellectually and emotionally. And they offer their thoughts on how the MCU might build on the revolutionary aspects of the movie in their future MCU films. Let us know what you thought about these aspects of the movie and what our panelists had to say about them in the Comments section below.

Documenting the shopping spree -- and the energetic performance that capped off the day -- we accompanied Joji as he picked up some new furniture and opened up about his origins.

Born and raised in Japan, Joji learned about American culture like many other overseas kids his age did: rap music and 2000s internet culture. From early YouTube and internet humor to Lil Wayne's classic 2008 classic ""A Milli,"" the most significant parts of Joji's upbringing gave him the foundations he needed for the multi-discipline career he has now. While Joji was nervous when he first started making music, everything paid off after the first few songs and he now stands as one of the modern era's more acclaimed singer-songwriters.

Joji’s 'In Tongues' Deluxe EP out now.

“Does every vote count? The answer it turns out is a resounding yes!

In Virginia, a recount has just flipped a seat in the House of Delegates to the Democrats, bringing to an end to Republican control of that chamber after 17 years.

But amazingly, the margin of victory for Shelly Simonds was just one vote, reports NPR.

Republicans have controlled the House of Delegates since 2000, and Simonds’ victory means the parties will now be split at 50-50. No tie-breaking procedure is in place, meaning that any measure that doesn’t get 51 votes does not advance.

Simonds ousted GOP incumbent David Yancey by a count of 11,608 to 11,607. Yancey actually led after Election Day by the razor-thin margin of 11,601 to 11,591, but Tuesday’s daylong recount in Newport News changed that.

Republican leaders in Virginia penned a statement saying they are “ready to establish a bipartisan framework under which the House can operate efficiently and effectively over the next two years.”

Hereditary has scared it's way through Sundance Film Festival and now it's on it's way to the public with a new trailer highlighting the disturbing ticks of a family in mourning. A creepy little and girl, disturbed teenage boy and crazy raging mother make up the cast of director Ari Aster's debut feature film.

In this episode of Things You Missed, we'll be taking a closer look at the trailer and all the strange inconsistencies it's begging it's audience to notice.

We'll also further examine the disturbing references, creepy hereditary traits, small details and figurines and strange guests at a funeral. This movie looks to be filled with miniscule details placed with the intent of psychologically unnerving it's audience, and here at CZsWorld, those are exactly the kinds of Things You Missed I love to see.

Lyrics

I carry with me all the love that you give
You brought me serenity, a reason to live
Our life is a journey
That we took from the start
We made all these memories together

I can remember
The first time that we met
The feelings you gave to me, I'll never forget
I knew from that moment
When our love first began
We'd last till the end of time forever

And though there were bad times
We stood by each other
And did what we had to get through

You live in my heart, when you're far away
I see you in dreams where I hear you say
I'm with you forever, in true love
By light of the day and stars above

And when there were bad times
We held on each other
To face what we had to get through

You live in my heart, when you're far away
I see you in dreams, when I hear you say
Look up to heaven, and I'll be there
Still guiding my heart
Still saying our prayer",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VMnNB2dseOI/sddefault.jpg,0.02077130608645544,0.0006461019968044145,32.148648648648646,0.0013882461823229984,0.021417408083259846,0.022805654265582846,2018-03-28,07:00:02,Wednesday,2,6,69,6,36,32,501,3,79,0,0,5,33,0,2,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.837480786316856,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

DRIVER SENTENCED: https://abc13.co/2K7eeyg

A high-speed police chase sprinted across the greater Houston area over lunch time, involving a 200MPH stolen Dodge Hellcat with a deputy's flying tackle ending the wild scene in a cow pasture.

Original chase: 10/13/17

It all started around noon when a suspect in a stolen white car led officers in pursuit along I-10. Speeds, at times, topped well over 100 mph. After roughly an hour, the suspect got off the freeway at the Winnie exit.

At about 1 p.m., the suspect pulled over to the side of Highway 73 south of Beaumont, and got out of the car. He took off on foot into a wooded area.

Officers searched for the driver amid the brush before he was spotted, walking casually and talking on his cell phone. A deputy tackled the man and he was taken into custody by helicopter.

Officers with Houston Police Department and at least one other Harris County agency began the pursuit. Texas DPS troopers, Chambers County Sheriff's deputies and the Beaumont Police Department helicopter assisted in the search.

The driver has been identified as Mohmed Ahmed Abu-Shlieba, 25. He was believed to have been armed during the chase. He was in a stolen vehicle, and had active warrants. There's no word on what new charges he may face.

LYRICS

Hey girl you like me a little bit
No, I don’t even like you a little bit
Come on girl - you like me a little bit
Ha! Not even a little bit!
Wait - don’t you like me a little bit?
Ew, I don’t even like you a little bit!
I heard you like me a little bit
Umm.. well, maybe just a little bit

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit

She wanna see me put in work for it
Dig it, digity digging in the dirt for it
For what? A golden ticket and the chance
At one day maybe holding her hand
Shorty where you wanna go with it
Said I’m just tryna roll with ya
I’m just tryna grow with ya
Girl quit it
Lord have mercy when I see ya in my throw back jersey
I’ll admit it I’m smitten
Baby girl salute cause you got me at attention
Shorty you the truth
Oh and ooh and did I mention
One and two
Me plus you
We go way back like alphabet soup
And I gotta give credit where the credit is do
Shout out to ya momma and ya grandma too
Tell me what's the situation
Why the hesitation
Um, have you talked to my daddy?
That’s another conversation

Hey girl you like me a little bit
No, I don’t even like you a little bit
Come on girl - you like me a little bit
Ha! Not even a little bit!
Wait - don’t you like me a little bit?
Ew, I don’t even like you a little bit!
I heard you like me a little bit
Umm.. well, maybe just a little bit

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit

You want a girl this real (all day)
You think you might catch feels (you may)
I know you like that yes
But will you treat a girl with respect
You say you want me to roll with ya
Say you want me to grow with ya
Then I need to see the full 4k picture
I ain’t dumb - you can spit your game
But does your heart mean the words that you’re saying?
Boy what you gonna do if i choose
To take another chance and learn another dance with you
How do
How do you protect me, promise to respect both me and you
Cause I ain’t playing games boy
If I let you catch me tag you’re it
I think i’m falling just a little bit

Hey girl you like me a little bit
No, I don’t even like you a little bit
Come on girl - you like me a little bit
Ha! Not even a little bit!
Wait - don’t you like me a little bit?
Ew, I don’t even like you a little bit!
I heard you like me a little bit
Umm.. well, maybe just a little bit

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit

Want me to pull out your chair
A little bit more
Open the door
A little bit more
What if I buy you flowers an take you to dinner?
Yeah?
Balcony on the top floor
Keep talkin
What if I take you to a movie
Boy do you really think that’d move me
What if I buy you a ring and make sure it fits
What!?  Boy that ain’t a little bit!

Hey girl you like me a little bit
No, I don’t even like you a little bit
Come on girl - you like me a little bit
Ha! Not even a little bit!
Wait - don’t you like me a little bit?
Ew, I don’t even like you a little bit!

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

In this video: Dutch language students from different countries tell about their experiences with Dutch people, the Dutch culture, and Dutch habits.

What did they go through when they moved to the Netherlands, meeting Dutch people... Facing Dutch reality... #dutchculture

These Dutch learners tell about:
- Dutch directness
- The Dutch culture shock!
- How Dutch people put everything in their agendas
- That Dutch people don't like to share a lot
- The importances of speaking Dutch as a foreigner
- How to integrate?

There is 1 mistake in the video: 'Katrina from Greece' should be 'Katerina from the US'

Video made by Bart de Pau and Nicolas Balbontin and the students of the BLC Dutch Winter School.

총탄을 입고 귀순한 북한군 병사.조금 전 들으신 것처럼 오늘 오전부터 총탄 제거를 위한 2차 수술 중에 있는데 사선을 넘은 북한군 병사와 관련된 내용 보다 상세히 알아보겠습니다. 

국방부 담당하고 있는 김주환 기자 연결해보겠습니다. 김주환 기자! 

[기자] 
국방부입니다. 

[앵커] 
첫 번째 의문점일 수도 있는데요. 엊그제 귀순한 병사, 어떻게 판문점까지 차량을 몰고 올 수 있었느냐 이 점인데요. 이거 어떻게 가능했습니까? 

[기자] 
일단 판문점이라는 곳이 어떤 공간인가에 대한 간략한 설명이 필요할 것 같습니다. 군사분계선 중심으로 남북 간 2km씩 비무장지대가 있습니다. 

그런데 판문점은 그 군사분계선 딱 가운데 있는 가로세로 300m의 일종의 공간이다. 섬이다, 이렇게 표현이 되겠습니다. 그곳은 UN부 사령부와 북한이 공동으로 경비하고 있는 겁니다. 

왜 UN군사령부냐면 정전협정 체결 당사자에 당시에 대한민국은 없었습니다. 그래서 유엔과 북한이기 때문에 거기에 들어가 있는 한국군 역시 유엔사 소속으로 이루어져 있습니다. 

이런 군사적 이유 때문에 북한 역시 굉장히 엄선된 군인들만 그곳을 경비를 시키고 있습니다. 

그런데 그 2km 후방 개성에 나중에 추가로 설명을 드리겠습니다마는 조선인민군판문점대표부라는 곳입니다. 

이곳 병사가 평소에도 늘 드나들었으니까 이것이 차량을 통해서 판문점 공동경비구역 내까지 들어와서 가능했다. 그것은 달리 말하면 이 병사 역시 굉장히 그 지형에 익숙한 사람이었다. 

그래서 북한에서는 차단선이라고 하는데요. 그 차단소의 검문소에서 아무래도 기존의 특별한 검문 없이 통과시키지 않았느냐, 이러한 개연성들을 이야기하고 있는 거죠. 

[앵커] 
그렇군요. 그래서 이 병사가 판문점대표부 소속 군인이었다 이런 새로운 사실이 밝혀진 거군요? 

[기자] 
그렇습니다. 판문점대표부 소속 군인에 대해서 설명을 하면요. 앞서 설명해 드렸듯이 우리도 역시 비무장지대 안에 GP라는 곳이 있습니다. 

그곳에 근무하는 우리 병사들을 민정경찰이라고 합니다. 북한 역시 북한 DMZ을 맡는 곳을 북한에서 줄여서 민경부대, 민경대대 이런 용어를 씁니다. 

그런데 우리가 판문점 공동구역에서 많이 화면에서 보는 북한군들은 좀 다릅니다. 이 사람들은 경무부대 소속인데 이들을 속칭해서 경무관이라고 부릅니다.... (중략)

[앵커]
지난 13일 북한군 병사가 판문점을 통해 귀순할 당시의 긴박했던 상황이 담긴 CCTV가 오늘 공개됐습니다. 귀순한 북한 병사는 이제 의식을 완전히 회복했습니다.

김정아 전 북한군 장교, 김주환 YTN 정치안보 전문기자 두 분과 이야기 나눠보겠습니다. 안녕하십니까?

먼저 북한군 병사 귀순 당시의 모습이 담긴 영화 같은 장면이다, 이런 표현들을 많이 하는데요. CCTV 7분가량 영상이 공개됐는데요. 화면을 보면서 설명을 좀 해 주실까요? 처음에 공개된 화면을 보면 북한 쪽에서 달려오는...

[기자]
북한군 북방한계선 방면에서 달려오고 있죠. 화면이 보이는데 참고로 상단 부분 좌측이, 화면상으로 과거 1953년도에 정전협정 조인식을 맺은 겁니다.

지금 판문점 자리가 아니라는 점을 한번 다시 상기시키고요. 그런데 차량이 쭉 달리죠. 일단 이 부분은 72시간다리를 건너서.

[앵커]
시속 한 70km 정도로 굉장히 빠른 속도로 질주하고 있는 모습이죠.

[기자]
지금 저기에서 우회전을 급격하게 하죠. 우회전을 하는 곳이 군 관계자들의 설명은 과거에 저 장소에 북한군 지프차들이, 비슷한 유형의 지프차들이 많이 들어왔다.

그러니까 이 병사가 오 모 병사가 저 지리를 굉장히 잘 알고 있는. 그래서 아마도 저런 전력질주 가능성으로 볼 때 물론 총격전이 있었습니다마는 그 전에 차가 배수로에 빠졌습니다만 추정컨대 여러 가지 취재를 해 보면 저 차량을 몰고 군사분계선을 넘어서 남쪽으로, 대한민국 쪽으로 귀순을 하려고 했던 것 같다는 것이죠.

[앵커]
지금 지프차가 배수로에 빠졌었고요.

[기자]
지금 굉장히 좌측에 북한측 초병의 권총사격이 보이고요, 엎드려 쏴, 자세히 보는 소총으로 엎드려 쏴 하는 자세가 보입니다. 앉아서 하는 모습이 보고요. 권총사격을 했죠.

[앵커]
지금 4명이 사격을 하는 모습이죠?

[인터뷰]
4명이 사격을 하는데 2명은 판문각 앞에서 정장 복장을 하고 우리 군과 마주서서 근무를 서는 정규 근무 병사고요. 두 명 같은 경우에는 복장이 다릅니다.

저기와 보이는 것 같이 방탄복을 입고 철갑모를 쓰고 그리고 휴대하지 말아야 할 AK소총을 휴대했습니다.

이 군인들 같은 경우에는 판문각 양 옆에 판문각 초소 안에서 숨어서 대기하는 저격수. 소위 말하는 보이는 근무성원이 ... (중략)

Casting is a key ingredient in the secret sauce of great filmmaking. In the best cases, a certain performer filling a certain character's shoes can turn a part into a franchise-leading phenomenon. But the real magic is in synergy, when several actors click; there's no X-Files without David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, and what would the original Star Wars movies have been without Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford together? But sometimes an actor's got to go. It's awful for the would-be star who watches the role end up becoming part of a massive hit while their replacement reaps the rewards — and it's just as bad for the actors who willfully walk away from the role of a lifetime, never to be heard from again...

LYRICS

We were so beautiful We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself, seventeen
Then you came found me
No other magic
Could ever compare
There’s a room
In my heart with the memories we made took em down but they’re Still in their frames
There’s no way I could ever forget
Mmm

For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
I will never not think about you
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one
And no matter what ever I do
I will never not think about you

What we had only comes
Once in a lifetime
For the rest of mine
I’ll always compare
To the room
In my heart with the memories we made
Nights on 5th, in between B and A
There’s no way I could ever forget

For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
I will never not think about you
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one
And no matter what ever I do
I will never not think about you

Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun? Looking back
Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun? Looking back
Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun?
We were so beautiful We were so tragic
No other magic

In this video, my room went from a grey, blush pink, and turquoise blue color sceme to a neutral black, white, and red color scheme/ aesthetic. I re-arranged my room, painted the walls, organized my “office”/ desk space, and redecorated. I also cleaned my room and showed some time lapse footage of the transformation. My room is sort of minimal/ minimalistic and is great as style inspiration for teenagers or adults! This is a completely affordable and inexpensive makeover, as I kept all of the furniture I already had. I hope this helps if you want to transform your room in your house or apartment into a modern bedroom on a budget! This is basically a re-doing my room video/ transforming my room 2018 and then showing the before and after at the end.

Potterheads couldn’t believe that it was the end of Harry Potter and this is why they were really happy to see that J.K. Rowling was working on a new series of movies: “Fantastic Beasts.” We already know that Eddie Redmayne, Johnny Depp, and Jude Law are part of the cast. But would it be possible for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint to join them? Today, we are showing you 10 Harry Potter characters that could be back in Fantastic Beasts. 

Warner Bros. already confirmed that Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) and Nicolas Flamel are going to be part of “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.” But according to some fan theories, we could see even more characters from the Harry Potter universe. It includes Tom Riddle, who was born in 1926 and graduated from Hogwarts in 1945. 

But how can the golden trio come back in the spin-off? After all, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley weren’t born yet. But J.K. Rowling found the answer to this question, and it is actually really fun! Make sure you watch this video to know more about this.

Stay tuned to hear more about Harry Potter characters that could be back in “Fantastic Beasts” including Rubeus Hagrid, Nagini, Ariana Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, and more. And you, who would you like to see in the movies? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think!

But, perhaps even more powerful than the message they’ve sent by wearing the color black are the powerful words they’ve shared in their red carpet interviews.

To begin, Michelle Williams showed up alongside the legendary Tarana Burke, A.K.A. the founder of the #METOO movement, which sends a bold message in and of itself. But, we’ve gotta be honest, when Michelle spoke she almost brought us to tears!

Michelle said of Tarana, QUOTE, ""I thought that I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world and I think that because of the work that Tarana has done and the work that I'm learning how to do, we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world."" WOW.

And, of course, Meryl Streep is the QUEEN of calling out injustices at the Golden Globes. I mean, remember her iconic speech from last year? Well, this year, she made her voice heard before the ceremony even began, saying, QUOTE, ""I think that people are aware now of a power imbalance and it's something that leads to abuse. It's led to abuse in our own industry and it's led to abuse across the domestic workers' field of work, it's in the military, it's in congress, it's everywhere and we wanted to fix that.""

The movement hits especially close to home for Emma Watson, who was asked of her own experiences with sexual harassment tonight on the red carpet. She said, “It’s amazing because I have experienced the full spectrum. But I think that, for me, what is amazing is that my experiences are not unique… You realize if you speak to most women they have an experience, they have a story.”

And it seems Scandal star Kerry Washington couldn’t agree more because she also came forward on the carpet with a bold message, saying that tonight in particular is a night for women to celebrate each other and to stand together, despite the injustices women have faced not only in Hollywood, but in other industries as well. She said, QUOTE, “This is not a problem in Hollywood, the abuse of power happens everywhere,” and honestly, we couldn’t agree more!

Alison Brie didn’t just show up tonight wearing black… She took it one step further and also sported a pant/dress hybrid! What a power move! She also said, QUOTE, ""Tonight is about women wearing the pants and so I chose to literally wear the pants."" She also added, QUOTE, “It’s important for me to stand with those who don’t feel they have a voice.” What an inspiration!

Sticking with the pant/dress theme, Debra Messing hit the carpet in a similar type of outfit as Alison and explained why wearing black was so important to her. She said, QUOTE, ""I am wearing black to thank and honor all the brave whistleblowers who came forward and shared their stories of harassment and discrimination.”

But it wasn’t just women who spoke out this evening in support of the Time’s Up movement! This is Us star Justin Hartley said, QUOTE, ""It means a lot to me and I think it means a lot to everyone and I think we all stand in solidarity here and I think we can all agree that time's up.""

Many other celebrities who wore black tonight took to their respective social media pages before they stepped out onto the carpet to spread some other messages about the movement, including Laura Dern, Jessica Chastain, and so many more!

On a recent trip to Robbins' Fiji resort Namale, where he was hosting the winners of Shopify's Build a Bigger Business competition, he showed Business Insider how to perform what he calls ""priming.""

Robbins, 57, is the world's most famous life and business coach and is as busy as ever, averaging 60 events each year. He developed priming as a way to maintain his energy and focus.

The routine, which involves a forceful breathing exercise and visualization of light pouring through your head, can seem pretty wild, but it's a slightly adapted version of a yoga technique called Kapalabhati Pranayama breathing and Buddhist mindfulness meditation.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Tony Robbins: My very first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is — I want to get my head right. I do this thing called ""priming."" Now, some people get up in the morning and they meditate, and I think meditation is wonderful. But I haven't met many people that can not think thoughts. This is a different outcome. This is about priming yourself. It's about putting yourself in a state where your mind and body will respond accordingly.

We'll do three steps. It's really simple — over 10 minutes. So why don't you sit down and I'll guide you through it. So, just get really comfortable. You want to be sitting up. Is that back enough for you to be able to relax?

Richard Feloni: Yeah.

Robbins: OK, cool. And then the first thing you're gonna do is your hands are gonna come up as you take the breath in and then you're gonna explode out the nose down.

Good. Now, relax. Keep your eyes closed. Have your hands open, if you would, on your lap face-up like that. Just feel whatever you feel. Just take it in. And you don't even have to respond to me anymore. You just enjoy it and take it in. And now just let your body relax deeply. And I'd like you to begin to think of a moment in your life that you could feel really grateful for if you wanted to. It could be something little, Rich, or it could be something big. It doesn't matter. It could be from your childhood or this week. It doesn't matter.

Do your best to remember it and then step into it as if you were there, kind of like stepping into your body and seeing what you saw then through your own eyes. Hearing what you heard then. Feeling what you felt then. Savor it. Maximize that sense of appreciation or enjoyment or gratitude. Enjoy it. Feel it. Fill up with it.

And now we're gonna shift to the last piece. Really simple. All you're gonna do is focus on three things, one at a time, that you want to accomplish. Three things you want to achieve. Live it and feel it and experience it.

How was that?

Feloni: It was good!

Robbins: Yeah? What'd you feel?

Feloni: It feels calming. Refreshing. It was good to like, escape inside myself.

Robbins: There's two worlds to master – the external world and the internal world. They both have to be mastered, but if you master the external world, you know, a la, you know, Robin Williams, but you don't master the internal world, there's a big price. This is the one to master first. And so I start my day by making that – so I have this base to deal with. I'm gonna live from gratitude today. I'm gonna live from blessing – you know, I'm gonna be a blessing in people's lives today. I'm gonna get stronger today. And I'm gonna achieve what I'm here and committed to do.

And then the whole thing, you know, we did that one in a little less than 10 minutes.

We love hearing about royalty. From their fabulous and expensive clothing, to their strange rules, it seems that they live entirely different lives than us commoners. But when it comes to basic human emotions such as love, we truly are all the same. Their relationships come with the same scandals and controversies that ours do, and that can sometimes spill over into their weddings. For those of us who would love to be royalty, it seems crazy to think anyone would willingly give up their title. But Princess Sayako and King Edward VIII were only too happy to abdicate their titles for true love. Prince Charles and Camilla are one of the more well-known scandalous couples, whose love affair wrecked two marriages before the two of them finally tied the knot to each other.

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.

Falcon Heavy's first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.

Following liftoff, the two side boosters separate from the center core and return to landing sites for future reuse.  The center core, traveling further and faster than the side boosters, also returns for reuse, but lands on a drone ship located in the Atlantic Ocean.

At max velocity the Roadster will travel 11 km/s (7mi/s) and travel 400 million km (250 million mi) from Earth.

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

The main building was ready for employees to begin partial occupancy in January 2018, as the building was still not finished, the process of moving more than 12,000 people, was estimated to take over six months.

Q&A: For the past two years fans have been complaining that the show is getting worse and their decisions are really bad. Obviously the people in charge aren't listening to what fans want to see. Between all of the terrible episodes last year, the string of bad choices Rick has made, and now killing Carl, do you think the producers or Scott Gimple or someone is intentionally trying to sink the show for some reason? I'm not really sure why they would, but they have to realize that what they've been doing hasn't worked, and they couldn't honestly believe people wouldn't jump ship after losing Carl (the future of the show) - Heather emc

Carl was bitten helping Saddiq, which rick told him not to do. Just goes to show that if you disobey dad, you die. I mean, after all, this is the kid who would never stay in the damn house like he was told. - Tassy McCormick 

It won't affect the show - Jason Bornot 

On Spoil the Dead, most people think that Chandler is lying in the interviews and did want off the show. He is trying to get a music career started. I think it will hurt the show. - Chris Scanlan

Hey Trev, remember in Season 2 Episode 10 ""18 Miles Out"" when Shane told Rick that he couldn't keep his family safe. Do you think he was right? -Andy Guadalupe

Q&A..what are the chances that Judith will fill the gap left by Carl? I think it makes more sense than the boy from the Kingdom. - Candida Jepsen

The death of Carl is honestly the worst thing they could have done with the show i was pissed when glenn died and now its carl - SwaggyToast 

Walking dead has just gone mainstream pop media - Alexander Sharpe

Hey Trev! Q&A when was the last time before Carl we had bite death? I believe it’s Noah but I’m not sure. I wanna know what your thoughts on bite deaths are. Are they an easy way out for a character death or important to the story line to remind us that walkers are still very much dangerous? Keep up the good work bud! - Becca Frye 

I can't believe it... I can NOT picture the show without Carl... - Jessica Guhl

Wow, that was a really dark episode. No, really, I couldn’t see anything. - Seth Barham

As always, thanks for watching everyone!

When Morpheus first spoke these iconic words in 1999, no-one could have predicted how influential they would become. Like the public's awakening from the prison of cruddy late '90s sci-fi blockbusters, Neo's awakening from the Matrix is recognized as one of the defining moments in modern cinema. But what if everything you thought you knew about your favorite philosophical action film was wrong? Time to take the red pill and find out the truth about the most common misconceptions of The Matrix...

Wherever there are rules, there are people using creative ways to break or at least bend them. This applies to real estate and planning regulations as much as anything else. For some, doing what they want on their own property, away from the prying eyes of the authorities is worth the risk of prosecution. Up until recently, the English homestead of Reeta Herzallah and Hamdi Almasri featured the most amazing hidden feature – until it was discovered by the local council.

Following is the transcript of the video:

Kevin Reilly: Fast food is cheap and convenient. But hidden in between the burgers and tacos are some ""healthy"" options: salads, grilled chicken, yogurts, oatmeal, power burritos. Doesn't sound too bad, right? I spent a week eating nothing but these ""healthy"" fast foods and I lost six-and-a-half pounds. But even though I lost about a pound a day, it didn't really go well.

I live in New York City, a place with every possible food you could want. Eating healthy here, it's a breeze. But across America, there are more than 200,000 fast food joints, and they're bringing in more than $200 billion a year in sales. And no matter where you go, you're never far from a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell. But in recent years, consumers want better, healthier choices, and the traditional fast food places have been losing customers to those fast casual healthy options.

The rules were pretty simple: Eat every major meal at a national fast food chain and stick to the healthy options. McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, and Chick-fil-A; nothing but them for a week. Yeah, I lost almost seven pounds, but let's take a close look at the numbers.

On a normal day, I'm eating around 2,500 calories. An adult man should be having about 2,400 to 2,600 calories a day. But on this fast food plan, my calories plummeted. Most of these meals came in under 400 calories, and that was one of my first problems. I'd eat and just a couple hours later, I was starving. And I had days when I didn't eat more than 1,000 calories.

Now, some of these meals were really good. My favorite was this grilled chicken market salad from Chick-fil-A. It had blueberries, strawberries, apples; it was delicious and it was actually healthy. However, a lot of the other salads from Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's were loaded with salt, often more than 50% of what I needed for the entire day, from a salad. In fact, excess salt was a problem the entire week. I thought I had hit the jackpot with Taco Bell's al Fresco menu. They take off all the cheese and mayo-based sauces and replace it with lettuce and pico de gallo. One night I got tacos, another night I got a power cantina burrito, and these were meals with more protein than usual. So, I felt like I was getting enough food. They were good, too good. It was all salt. In fact, just one burrito had almost as much salt as I needed in just one day. The American Heart Association says we should limit our sodium to about 2,300 milligrams a day, but the ideal is closer to 1,500 milligrams a day, especially for a person like me with high blood pressure. But if you look at my sodium intake, it was high every day, yet I was barely getting the calories I needed. If I wanted to keep the sodium down, I was starving. If I wanted to feel full, salt through the roof. You see, that's an issue in the fast food industry. Wendy's even acknowledges on their website that there's going to be a trade-off between salt and flavor.

It was weird. I didn't feel healthy at all throughout the week, even though I was eating healthy foods and losing weight. And on the last day, I had this massive headache that was just infuriating. These places, they're supposed to be tasty, cheap, and convenient. But it wasn't cheap. Every healthy option was expensive, but left me hungry. For eight grilled nuggets and this tiny kale salad at Chick-fil-A, $12. For the power Mediterranean salad at Wendy's, it was almost $8, yet I could get a cheeseburger, nuggets, fries, and a soda for only $4. That brings me to another problem. Walk into McDonald's and you get hit with that sweet, sweet french fry smell, and I had to get a salad.

Would I recommend this to anyone? Nope, unless you're stuck on the road with no other options. Though there was a bright spot: breakfast at Subway. They have these egg-white-and-cheese sandwiches, which I got covered in spinach and peppers. And let me tell you, it was good. But after all this, I just want a cheeseburger.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vbm-uJ8msgc/sddefault.jpg,0.011238054593777212,0.001298773288066008,8.65282239559431,0.001386391311629892,0.01253682788184322,0.013923219193473113,2018-05-05,19:00:04,Saturday,5,13,37,13,35,67,326,2,72,2,1,13,6,6,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.697006380150232,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'hot dog': 1, 'person': 6}",7

It was the dawn of 1863, and London's not-yet-opened subway system — the first of its kind in the world — had the city in an uproar.

Christian Wolmar explains how the London Underground was built at a time when no one had built a railway under a city before.

Remember Iced Gems? They were kind of brilliant but also nothing special to eat, which is why I have reimagined them so that they not only look great, they taste delicious too!

Recipe - 
For the biscuit base...
75g soft unsalted butter
30g caster sugar
115g plain flour
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
a pinch of salt

For the meringues...
2 lg egg whites, weighed
double the weight of egg white in caster sugar
(eg egg white = 60g, sugar = 120g, etc)
pinch of salt
food colouring paste

Now, she’s getting ready to take the stage again for Weekend 2, and even though she makes rapping during that hot festival look easy, we’ve just learned that it’s so much harder for her than we thought.Should Cardi B be taking it easy during these sensitive times?

Armed with Pavlov’s theory of Classical Conditioning and a boatload of cat treats, will Micah be able to teach the cats this trick? Will psychology prevail?

Manuel Fernandez
Do you think Disney gets bad rap as people say it “wants to control everything” or “take over the world?” I feel like it'd be bad for business if they, metaphorically speaking, ""controlled everything""


StarWarsGirl91
Even though you predicted 60% drop or more for the Last Jedi's 2nd weekend's box office, should we be concerned with its current box office trajectory?


ToonyTube
Hi from Germany! I get more and more confused. Sometimes I read how much the audience like TLJ, and then I read how much the audience hate the movie? Where are we now? Like your show and I'm with you with many of your opinions.


Jose m
John, heard you're gonna put up a TOP 10 BEST films of 2017. Will you also do a TOP 10 worst? would love to hear you tear themto shreds especially TF5


Ben Rainer
HI John hope you're having a good holiday.


Manuel Fernandez
Most pleasant surprise this year: Power Rangers, Girls Trip, Happy Death Day, or Jumanji?


Harris Husic
So WB are still going w the existing DCEU, and Flashpoint is still happening. What changes will be made u think? more color 😃 ? BvS never happened?


James Smith
good day John,i was wondering why r there no movie theaters 24 7 and is it even a small chance it ever will be? I feel im not the ONLY one who would go to the movies at 1am or 5am.


Jose m
Over/under 60% IW breaks TLJ opening weekend BO?


Antonio Degrandis
For those who think Star Wars is in trouble. TLJ crossed $800 million in two weeks lol Star War is just fine


James Smith
How can one get any career in the movie field as far as a movie reviewer or critic or even job at a theater hq?I really want a career watching movies


dimsum05
How does YouTube Red affect you vs ads? Thanks!


Jose m
John any chance you might invite Michael Rapaport for a TJCS live show,I remember one of his hilarious appearances on Collider doing his classic rants


Chris Warden
Happy holidays John. I hope you feel better. Gotta an age old question that movie fans have been asking for decades. Who wins in a fight between the 2 Detroit Supercops. Axel Foley or Robocop? Lol


Manuel Fernandez
Does historical accuracy ever have an impact on your enjoyment of a biopic? For instance in The Greatest Showman?


Rob McDonald
I'm proud fan of yours from Mississauga, keep up the great work. Any chance you will be doing a meet up during your time back in Canada?


Stevan Gonzalez
In this fantasy, both video game movies are guaranteed to be successful: A James Cameron directed Horizon Zero Dawn, or Guillermo del Toro Bioshock film. Your choice?


harsh baid
Hey John if you could swap one actor between the DCEU and MCU who would they be ? mine would be Ezra Miller as Peter and Tom Holland as Barry


Koba
could tarantino's star trek movie use TNG crew.


Brandon Torres
Hey John, Star Wars is not about the Skywalkers but the episodic saga is. Kathy Kennedy has called it ""the Skywalker saga"" many times


jamie

Режиссер и автор сценария: Дин ДеБлуа

По мотивам романов Крессиды Коуэлл

Продюсеры: Брэд Льюис, Бонни Арнольд

Когда-то викинги жили в гармонии с драконами. В те времена они делили радость, горе… и последние штаны. Казалось, что так будет всегда, но появление загадочной Дневной Фурии изменило жизнь острова. В заключительной части головокружительной франшизы Иккинг и Беззубик столкнутся с безжалостным охотником на драконов, жаждущим уничтожить все, что им дорого.

Videos explaining things. Mostly over topics like history, geography, economics and science. 

We believe that the world is a wonderfully fascinating place, and you can find wonder anywhere you look. That is what our videos attempt to convey. 

Currently, I try my best to release one video every week. Bear with me :)

Cole released his most recent album ‘KOD,’ he dropped off a surreal music video for “ATM.” The self-produced song finds the North Carolina rapper addressing his complicated relationship with money. In the Scott Lazer-directed clip, Cole deals with the downsides of wealth. He’s driven mad by all his money in one scene, while another features him being robbed of large sums of cash. After losing everything while gambling, he’s forced to literally give up an arm and a leg to purchase a fancy red convertible.

Any ideas you might have I can try and do!

Kylie Jenner, 20, is apparently loving motherhood SO much that she already thinks she wants to add another little one into the mix! The reality star only gave birth to her first child, daughter Stormi Webster, on Feb. 1, but she’s been open about wanting to be a mom for a while now. She welcomed Stormi with Travis Scott, 25, and so far, the two of them are reportedly raising their little girl together and cannot get enough of the cutie! Next time around though, Kylie apparently wants a baby boy!

Hey Guys! Time for some more new music! I'm very proud to present my new single ""Lonely"" with the amazing MAX... In all the stories I wanted to share in my ""One In A Million"" album there are vibes that are uplifting and inspirational but also real. I get my energy touring all the time from the amazing fans I meet and this album is for you guys, but I also have low points like anyone else, from the industry politics, fake people or whatever that is bad and negative energy and the lyrics in the song ""Lonely"" is for them. I also think when people hear this song they will in some way connect to a story in there own meaning because every life has ups and downs, but it's always important to take the negativity and make it to something positive. I've done that with ""Lonely""!!!  - Tom

A beautiful woman who has been given just days to live has shared her final photos after her shocking cancer diagnosis.

Amy Redhead, 28, battled severe abdominal pain before her sudden bowel cancer diagnosis last October.

The aggressive disease had already spread to 70 per cent of her liver and Amy’s cancer was terminal.

After being offered chemotherapy to prolong her life, she refused and instead decided to enjoy her final months without feeling unwell.

This stunning phenomenon appears to be an on-rushing ‘ghost snow tsunami’, as a rare light and wind alignment causes a mesmerizing mirage to form on the horizon.

Nature-buff Ariel McGlothin was hoping to capture some local wildlife in action when she trudged out in the harsh winter conditions of Kelly, Wyoming, USA, but inadvertently witnessed an incredibly rare spectacle.

Standing before a huge wall of icy powder, a strange mirage begins to form as the sun – aligned perfectly with the direction of the wind – begins to highlight snow crystals moving in the blistering breeze, resembling a series of ghostly waves crashing against a shoreline.

The haunting display lasts for several moments as the virtually translucent ‘waves’ continue to flow forward in a fearsome flurry, leaving 30-year-old Ariel with a conflicted feeling that she ‘needed to flee’ the seeming tsunami. – SEE CATERS COPY

The dramatic rescue, which saw Gassama clamber from balcony to balcony and reaching the child in less than 30 seconds, was captured on video (top). He has since been compared to the Marvel superhero Spiderman. Gassama, who said he arrived in France a few months ago 'dreaming of building his life' in the country, was pictured meeting French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace this morning (bottom). Macron said the migrant will be made a French citizen and will also be offered a place in the fire brigade.

ABOUT SALICE ROSE:
With over 8.1 million followers on Instagram, the 23 year old bilingual Peruvian/American comedian influencer, Salice Rose, was born in Lancaster California and has always held a strong ambition to make others smile which catapulted her to be in front of the camera. In her own words, Salice expresses that she isn't always aware if her followers are laughing with her or laughing at her but regardless as long as it keeps them smiling then that's more than enough for her to keep on creating content. Aside from cracking jokes and participating in adventurous dares Salice also has a strong passion for both music and dance. Being an avid hip-hop and belly dancing aficionado, Salice loves to spend any extra time she can on the dance floor breaking a sweat!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VojYvR2vOSU/sddefault.jpg,0.056351150346609764,0.0005621079966739005,100.24968632371392,0.004840335233592194,0.05691325834328365,0.06175359357687585,2018-04-04,00:30:03,Wednesday,2,10,45,10,24,63,331,4,49,2,0,7,0,1,0,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.2616421875275226,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Well, it is a real thing, and I can tell you it is not a new thing. It is also something that will not have a direct impact on Central Ohio.

What is a bomb cyclone?
All cyclones in the northern hemisphere are centers of low pressure.  They can be a simple low on a map bringing the typical changing weather, a tropical storm, a hurricane for example.  Hurricanes and tropical storms are tropical because of their characteristic of having a warm core.

This system is an area of low pressure that will become massive, deep (low pressure), and will cause some major weather changes over a vast area of the planet.  The 'bomb' part comes from the fact that this low will intensify rapidly, so much so that it will have what is considered explosive intensification.

For example, right now here in Central Ohio, we have cold high pressure in command for the moment, and our surface pressure is roughly 1030 millibars.  Well this system will develop tomorrow morning with pressure at about 1005 millibars, so lower pressure for sure.  But within 24-30 hours, some forecast models have this pressure dropping 30-40 or more millibars, which is incredible.  It would be an alarming drop in pressure for a hurricane as well.

For the record, Hurricane Wilma in 2005 had a 24 hour record pressure drop of 97 millibars.

How does the forecast pressure minimum compare to a hurricane?
Well according to some of the forecast models, this storm could drop its central pressure into the 950 millibar range.  If it were to get that low, it would be a deeper low than many of our hurricanes and tropical storms in the Atlantic in 2017.  Tropical Storm Don, Bret, Emily, Philippe, Rina, Cindy, Arlene, and Hurricanes Nate, Franklin, Katia, Gert, Lee, and Ophelia all had higher central pressure minimums than this storm may have.  Lee and Ophelia were cat. 3 storms too!

So what are we going to see happen on Wednesday and Thursday?
First, there are winter weather advisories to winter storm warnings from Florida to Maine.  Let that sink in, WINTER STORM WARNINGS IN FLORIDA!!!

The bulk of what falls in northern Florida could fall as mainly icy mix, which we all know is worse than getting some snow.  This will be a threat up the east coast, and with stronger and gustier winds expected as the storm builds north, this could risk power outages and many other hazards from ice.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vqcv_C7iUfQ/sddefault.jpg,0.00466885699463946,0.0006916825177243648,6.75,0.0032854919591907322,0.005360539512363825,0.008646031471554556,2018-01-03,03:40:38,Wednesday,2,11,24,11,20,53,210,2,46,0,0,1,0,7,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.217515835500159,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Out of your life
And I’m just a dead man walking tonight

Recipe:

Vegan Mac & Cheese
 
MAKES 4 to 6 servings
PREP TIME: 45 minutes   
COOK TIME: 45 minutes
 
Ingredients:

PASTA
3 cups elbow macaroni
 
CHEESE SAUCE
1 cup raw cashews (soaked for 20 minutes in hot water)
2 1⁄4 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk (almond or soy)
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup nutritional yeast
1⁄4 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 1⁄2 tablespoons miso paste
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons arrowroot or tapioca flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon white pepper (or ground pepper)
 
TOPPING
1⁄4 cup multigrain bread crumbs
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon sea salt
 
Pre-heat oven to 350 F. To cook the pasta, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente. Drain, but do not rinse. 
 
To prepare the topping, combine the bread crumbs, nutritional yeast, dried herbs, and sea salt in a small bowl.
 
To make the cheese sauce, drain and rinse the soaked cashews. Add to a high-powered blender with the remaining sauce ingredients and combine until very smooth.
 
In a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or baking dish, stir the pasta and sauce together until the macaroni is well coated. Sauce will thicken during baking.
 
Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly on top. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes.
 
Remove the foil and bake on the top rack of the oven for 10 minutes until the top is golden brown and the sides are bubbling slightly. Depending on your oven and the distribution of heat, you might want to set the skillet under the broiler for 5 minutes to get the top crispier instead of continuing to bake at 350°F. Serve immediately.
 
When reheating leftovers, you may want to add more non-dairy milk to get the mac creamy once again.

How many times can he juggle each one? But before even taking the challenge, he must first discover which balls are inside each box. Check it out and see how far Coutinho's skills take him!
