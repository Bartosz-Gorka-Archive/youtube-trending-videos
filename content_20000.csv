As most of you know, the biggest award on Oscars night is, without a doubt, Best Picture, and this year, the Oscar went to The Shape of Water! To accept the award, director Guillermo Del Toro went onstage to make his speech, backed by some of the incredible men and women who helped make the movie happen.

Amazingly, this was just one of the four awards The Shape of Water received tonight, also winning in the categories of Best Director, Original Score, and Production Design.

Now, with Best Picture behind us, let‚Äôs take a look at who took home to awards in the acting categories, shall we?

As many people anticipated, Best Actor went to none other than Gary Oldman for his performance in Darkest Hour, and as much as we would‚Äôve loved to see first time nominee Timoth√©e Chalamet (tim-o-thee sha-la-may) scoop this award, Gary did seem appreciative of the recognition, and even dedicated the award to his mom on her birthday!

Along with Gary, actor Sam Rockwell took home an Oscar tonight, too, but his was in the category of Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Three Billboard‚Äôs Outside Ebbing, Missouri.‚Äù 

And, speaking of Three Billboards, the incredible Frances McDormand won the Oscar for Best Actress for that same movie, and when we say her acceptance speech was incredible‚Ä¶ it was INCREDIBLE!

Not only was Frances deserving of the award for the amazing work she did in the film, but her speech gave us chills, especially at the end when she asked for all of the women who were nominated to stand up with her and to be seen.

I mean, how awesome is that?!

Frances wasn‚Äôt the only actress to get recognized for her work this year, though, and Allison Janney took home a well-deserved award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in I, Tonya.

And even though those are the awards that most people will be talking about for the next few days, we can‚Äôt forget some of the other notable achievements of the night. Following closely behind The Shape of Water, Dunkirk won in three categories including Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing! 

Right behind Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049 earned the awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography while the animated film Coco won the Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song for ‚ÄúRemember Me.‚Äù We know, we know‚Ä¶ we thought The Greatest Showman had that one in the bag with the song ‚ÄúThis is Me,‚Äù but hey‚Ä¶ we told you there were snubs!

Along with the acting, the cinematography, the sound and the music, though, comes some very important categories we don‚Äôt always immediately think of, like makeup and costume design, for example. Well, the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hair went to The Darkest Hour, while the Best Costume Design went to Phantom Thread. 

And, before we wrap things up, some other notable awards of the night went to A Fantastic Woman for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Adapted Screenplay for Call Me By Your Name, and Best Original Screenplay to Jordan Peele for the film Get Out, which, by the way, marks the first time a black person won that award!

Well, now that the big night is over, how do you guys feel about tonight‚Äôs big winners? Were the award spot-on or do you feel there were there some major snubs? Let us know in the comments section below, and then click right over here for more on Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs opening monologue. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I‚Äôm your host Erin Robinson and I‚Äôll see you next time!

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyonc√© of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically, I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

I started off with 20lbs¬†of my¬†Ultimate Carrot Cake, showered with Orange Spice Simple Syrup,and layered with rich Cream Cheese Frosting!I then decorated each tier with Italian Meringue Buttercream, piping on different sized polka dots for a flawless touch! Then I finished off the cake with bunches of flowers.

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

PMjq4-lj2xc,vRf3azp1pak,Ariana Grande BREAKS DOWN Sobbing About Manchester Bombing,Clevver News,24.0,2018-05-18 18:11:19+00:00,"['Ariana grande', 'Ariana grande time magazine', 'time magazine', 'Ariana grande talks Manchester', 'Ariana grande breaks down', 'Ariana grande cry', 'time magazine next generation leaders', 'News', 'newsfeed', 'entertainment', 'clevver news']",916423.0,17459.0,423.0,843.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PMjq4-lj2xc/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

May 22nd will mark the 1-year anniversary of the terrorist attack killed 22 people and injured hundreds more at Ariana Grande‚Äòs concert in Manchester. Although the singer has come a long way since going through that horrific event, the heartache is still incredibly real. 

The 24-year-old was asked about making music after the bombing for Time magazine‚Äôs Next Generation Leaders issue and she couldn‚Äôt help but become overcome with emotion and start sobbing.

Ari said through tears QUOTE ‚ÄúThere are so many people who have suffered such loss and pain. The processing part is going to take forever‚Ä¶‚Äù

She was unable to finish her thought before getting choked up once again and telling the interview she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about the attack. 

She explained QUOTE ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give it that much power, something so negative. It‚Äôs the absolute worst of humanity. That‚Äôs why I did my best to react the way I did. The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won. Music is supposed to be the safest thing in the world. I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still so heavy on my heart every single day. I wish there was more that I could fix. You think with time it‚Äôll become easier to talk about. Or you‚Äôll make peace with it. But every day I wait for that peace to come and it‚Äôs still very painful.‚Äù

Ariana wrote her new single ‚ÄúNo Tears Left to Cry‚Äù about finally getting her feet back on the ground after feeling upside-down for so long. It took awhile, but the music started coming once she started healing. 

She added QUOTE ‚ÄúWhen I started to take care of myself more, then came balance, and freedom, and joy; it poured out into the music. We‚Äôve messed with the idea of not being able to find the ground again, because I feel like I‚Äôm finally landing back on my feet now.‚Äù

Ari still obviously is incredibly emotional about what happened last May but she ultimately wants fans to know that she‚Äôs happy and won‚Äôt let it stop her from living her life and honoring those we lost. 

I honestly can‚Äôt even imagine how hard it must‚Äôve been for Ariana to not only cope with the Manchester attack, but then continue living life in public with everyone‚Äôs eyes on her at all times. It‚Äôs clear that she‚Äôs nowhere near over it, but is leaning on music, friends and family to move forward. How do you feel after hearing that Ariana broke down talking about the attack? Are you a fan of her new song? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below and then click here to get the details about Mac Miller‚Äôs recent arrest. I‚Äôm your host Drew Dorsey thanks so much for watching Clevver and I‚Äôll see you next time.

En Genius podemos ver a Sia como una mujer dificil que no cae por cualquier persona que trata de conquistarla, a ella le gustan los genios, los intelectuales, porque sabe que en este mundo pocos hay.

*mi √°lgebra siempre termina dando igual: esto es una met√°fora, es como si Labrinth tuviera un metodo algebraico para poder llegar al nivel de Sia y que ella se fije en √©l.

*ser√°s mi einstein, mi newton, mi galileo y mi hawking: son los nombres de los cient√≠ficos m√°s influyentes en la historia de la humanidad.

*apunta los ""i"" y cruza los ""t"": la frase ""apunta/dibuja los puntos (i) y cruza las letras (t)"" quiere decir que prestan gran atenci√≥n a cada peque√±o detalle de una tarea; Sia le dice al chico que se fije bien en cada detalle de ella porque es todo lo que √©l necesita.

I can only imagine how disappointed the people of DICE, Criterion and Motive must feel to have  produced a game so  strong, and so faithful to the source material, only to have it received in this way because of EA's targeting interventions. 

This review is for the developers more than anything else. I wanted to pay tribute to the fine work they've done, while cautioning against the potential impact that a game like this would have on the future were it allowed to succeed.

He's even counting the number of trips to the airport he has left until he can leave DC for good.  

""[T]o the extent men judge themselves based on what they do for a living, I don't have a lot to show for the last seven years,"" the departing Congressman told VICE News. 

Among the most prominent members to be elected as part of the Tea Party wave in 2010, Gowdy gained national notoriety as a fiercely partisan interrogator of Hillary Clinton following the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. 

He said he doesn't relish the reputation, or think it's justified.  And it's helped drive him out of Congress.  

But at least he made some friends along the way.

[ SF9(ÏóêÏä§ÏóêÌîÑÎÇòÏù∏) ]

MAMMA MIA! A true love was found!
 
SF9, who is popular for its various concepts including future boys and knights of the sun, came back with its fourth mini album, ‚ÄòMAMMA MIA!‚Äô, as the heroes of a high school musical movie. The title track ‚ÄòMAMMA MIA‚Äô describes the confidence and willingness of young boys who will win the love in front of them in a playful way. It is an exciting retro song mixed with the rich rhythmical drum sound and the lively guitar riff in the intro.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PS8ZVDXEjDE/sddefault.jpg,0.02105573525968452,0.0009279092556780242,22.69158878504673,0.0011967427783510967,0.02198364451536253,0.02318038729371363,2018-06-12,05:10:30,Tuesday,1,9,35,9,30,49,306,1,73,0,1,6,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0117586668609855,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

However, the gym can be a scary and intimidating place. #gymtidationisreal So, I've compiled this list of 5 simple things you can do to hopefully help you look and feel your best so you can walk into the gym feeling more confident and slay your workout.
Please keep in mind, these are things that I personally like to do--I in no way think that you absolutely have to do any of these things to look good at the gym. At the end of the day, wear whatever makes you feel comfortable and confident at the gym whether it's sweats and a t-shirt or a full face of makeup.

Weightlifting Shoes:
- Nike Metcon (https://amzn.to/2IlEgNc)
- Nike Romaleos (https://amzn.to/2HTXj1N)
- Classic Converse Chuck Taylor (https://amzn.to/2FOOVKY)
- New Balance Sole Zero Sole
- Reebook Legacy (https://amzn.to/2HUk1Hh)
(These are shoes I'd recommend to use days you're going to be doing squats, deadlifts, or hipthrusts. Any other days at the gym, I will wear whatever shoes I feel like.)

In ‚ÄúIncredibles 2,‚Äù Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack‚Äîwhose super powers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don‚Äôt shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That‚Äôs what makes this family so Incredible.
 
Written and directed by Brad Bird (‚ÄúIron Giant,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Incredibles,‚Äù ‚ÄúRatatouille‚Äù) and produced by John Walker (‚ÄúThe Incredibles,‚Äù ‚ÄúTomorrowland‚Äù) and Nicole Grindle (‚ÄúSanjay‚Äôs Super Team‚Äù short, ‚ÄúToy Story 3‚Äù associate producer), Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúIncredibles 2‚Äù busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.

Francis had to change cars en route to Lima from the airport on Friday after the Fiat 500 he was riding in got a flat.
Vatican spokesman Greg Burke confirmed the change of plans in a message to journalists.
He said the tyre started losing air a few miles (kilometres) from the presidential palace, where Francis was due to meet with Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
The pope didn't lose a beat, using the meeting and subsequent speech to Peruvian authorities to denounce corruption as a ""social virus"" that infects all aspects of life and must be combatted.

I also expanded it to include 8 reindeer instead of the 4 that come in the set.

Turn on the captions to read some notes about the build.

The base houses a central drive shaft that transfers power to a crank shaft under each pair of reindeer. It is powered using a Power Functions M-Motor.

More information and building instructions will be coming soon on my website.

And now that The Last Jedi is out we can point out even more great connections! In this full breakdown of Star Wars Battlefront 2, over 60 Star Wars Easter Eggs are spotted, and all kinds of connections to other Star Wars movies and novels are made. Filup Molina identifies every single easter egg the CAMPAIGN features.

Star Wars Battlefront was always missing a great campaign and this game features a great one. As you watch the Battlefront 2 Gameplay you get to live out the whole story of Iden Versio as she make a huge impact on all of Star Wars canon. Of course this isn‚Äôt just gameplay, Star Wars Battlefront 2 features a great movie in all cut scenes, and so this video also works as a Battlefront 2 review of those cutscenes. The campaign itself is a lot of fun, but don‚Äôt judge Filup‚Äôs gameplay too harshly. He dies A LOT.

Huge huge thanks to EA for sponsoring this video and inviting Filup to get to play Star Wars Battlefront 2 ALL DAY LONG, TIL HE BEAT IT, WHICH TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING FOR SO MANY CAMPAIGN EASTER EGGS‚Ä¶ It was a blast!

Here's the link to my similar epic rant about the prequel Star Wars: Force Awakens https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2IWxIxokHA&t=

NOTE: To all the people saying ""Darth Vader was toying with Luke, he didn't plan to kill Luke, he let Luke do well in battle"" I know this! It is stated in the link above in my last video. The point is, even though Vader gave Luke a fighting chance so he could try to turn him to the darkside, it's farfetched that Luke would have been able to have even a basic duel with Vader (whose training is complete [10s of 1000s of hours] who is the most powerful force-sensitive user ever).

Andre Black Nerd Rants on the Nintendo Labo, the Nintendo Direct Mini 1.11.2018, and Nintendo Switch Ports of Video Games, specifically Nintendo Wii U Ports to Nintendo Switch. Does every Nintendo fan have to like, buy, and/or collect every Nintendo thing that comes out? Has Nintendo learned its lesson from the Wii and Wii U to not put all its eggs in one basket and do a combination of hardcore games and innovative ideas like Nintendo Labo. Is Nintendo Labo worth getting angry over?

Games Mentioned in This Video: Nintendo Labo, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, ARMS, Splatoon 2, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, Dark Souls Remastered, Mario Tennis Aces, Kirby Star Allies, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Pokken Tournament DX, Bayonetta

LYRICS:
Outside for the first time 
In a long time
Lose yourself
Sink into the sunlight
It's been while since you've felt right
But the warm nights are coming soon
And you'll be just fine

Outside for the first time in a long time
You said you can't remember what it's like
To feel more than cold on the inside
But the sunrise will come again
And you'll be just fine 

I think it's time you had a pink cloud summer
You've gone too long without a smile
I think it's time you found another
Reason to stay for a while
I think it's time you gave yourself a little color
I don't know much, but I hear that red is in style
I think it's time you had another reason to stay for a while 
You should stay for a while

I sit and watch, now with new eyes,
For the green side
Lose myself
Sink into your sunlight
Breath in the breeze like a sweet sigh
Keep me tongue tied
If this lasts forever I'll be just fine

You are the rustling of leaves
You are that honeysuckle breeze
You are the sunlight
Shine onto me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PedACuLiMxU/sddefault.jpg,0.011108619271884576,0.0001533976227853779,72.41715399610136,0.0003139717425431711,0.011262016894669956,0.011575988637213128,2017-11-14,21:41:34,Tuesday,1,6,1,6,1,42,12,3,4,0,0,5,1,0,0,6.0,12.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.135017122938452,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PehB2QTn7jI/sddefault.jpg,0.009695080177889248,0.0001683677616376958,57.58275862068965,0.0002879669302493004,0.009863447939526943,0.010151414869776243,2018-04-18,08:35:01,Wednesday,2,9,37,9,32,48,325,0,76,0,1,8,16,1,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1130318116662075,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

How did this character get here, and what does this cameo mean for the future of Star Wars?

Spoilers below!

The ending of SOLO features several twists, but perhaps the most unexpected was the return of Darth Maul, whose survival after Phantom Menace was explained in the animated series Star Wars Clone Wars, but was not expected to tie into the Star Wars movies. Erik Voss explains how Maul survives, and how he rose to take over the Star Wars criminal underworld. What is the Crimson Dawn? How was Maul's return foreshadowed in the movie? And how does Maul's return affect future Star Wars movies?

Selena Gomez is out and about in London right now working hard and doing some press, but that didn‚Äôt stop her from taking some time out to add to her Insta-story. After all, she is the reigning queen of Instagram! 

The post was a video of Sel resting in bed after a long day, and if we‚Äôre being honest, she looked a little down. The video was captioned with, QUOTE, ‚ÄúI need some alone time,‚Äù and was deleted quickly after it was posted, making us wonder, is there trouble in paradise ALREADY between her and JB?

Well, we‚Äôre not so sure, but to be fair, aside from this short video, we‚Äôve been provided with nothing else that even hints at relationship troubles, so honestly, it‚Äôs too soon to tell. 
Personally, we‚Äôre not too concerned considering Selena‚Äôs always been one to cherish her alone time. Recently she told Billboard about her private Calabasas home, saying, QUOTE, ‚ÄúI like feeling removed, and I wanted a place where I could be alone.‚Äù 

It certainly doesn‚Äôt seem like Selena‚Äôs the only one taking some time to unwind, though. Justin also took to Instagram to share that he‚Äôs spending some much-needed quality time with his dad. Along with a photo of him and his dad walking side-by-side, he wrote, QUOTE, ‚ÄúI love continuing to get to know my father. I love working through the hard things to get to the good things.. relationships are worth fighting for especially with family!! Love you forever and always daddy!‚Äù

He‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ relationships are worth fighting for. Wink wink, nudge nudge. 

But even though we‚Äôre still going to assume things are going just fine for Jelena, it seems like The Weeknd might still not be over the split! Apparently, he joked about long distance relationships with the crowd at his concert in Sydney, Australia on Saturday, making people speculate whether he was making a joke about his 10-month long relationship with Sel. He said, QUOTE, ‚ÄúI know this is like a long-distance relationship here. But I feel like I‚Äôll come to Sydney every year, at least once.‚Äù

So what do you guys think? Is Jelena in rough water? Was The Weeknd throwing shade at his relationship with Sel? Let us know in the comments section below, and as always, don‚Äôt forget to subscribe! Thanks for watching Clevver News, I‚Äôm your host Renee Shafii and I‚Äôll see you next time!

Left on my own for the following few days, I change the door for a better one and I finish the wood plank flooring, the perfect compliment to the stone floor and all very appropriate for a log cabin in the forest. The challenges of living off grid in a tiny house are becoming apparent, as temperatures as low as -32C (-26F) with windchill freeze the waterways and dump a couple of feet of snow in the bush.
The video starts with my wife and Cali helping me remove snow and install a new custom branded fire pit and branded iron sign gifted to me by Kyle at Iron Arts in Barrie Ontario http://www.ironartsonline.com/  In the following days, I discover how warm I can keep the cabin in this cold weather despite the chinking not being completely done and a few gaps left unsealed.
I show a few of the meals that I'm cooking on the wood stove, including grilled cheese sandwich, Thai tom yum soup and wild goose confit with rice and kimchi, fermented cabbage. 
Living off grid with no electricity or fuel other than wood makes it difficult to store food. I finish making the ice box in the floor to keep food from freezing or from spoiling when the cabin is heated.
The bears are hibernating and the deer have moved to their winter deer yards a few miles away, so there isn't as much wildlife around. Blue jays, ravens and squirrels keep me company, but that's about it.

Artificial intelligence is the presently hypothetical possession of intelligence or the exercise of thought by machines such as computers or androids. In Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049, bio-androids called replicants are created by humans to perform labor. They differ from other androids in science fiction because they are made primarily from organic substances, but they are programmed much like a computer. Other forms of artificial intelligences exist in the narrative as well, such as Joi ‚Äì a digital AI who presents as a hologram. Replicants can rent apartments and have jobs, but they do not have the same legal status as human beings. They can and are executed without trial. They are essentially slaves. Digital AI like Joi has even less freedom, if that were possible. Artificial intelligence may be an inevitability in the real world, but with this eventual breakthrough will come questions about how artificially intelligent beings will interact with our world, our legal system and our culture.

This find has quite a history, as is explained in the video. 

Miyazaki himself presented the first footage of the Chalice Dungeons at the first ever PlayStation Experience Convention in December 2014. Showcased in the footage was most prominently an Undead Giant with two blades for arms, one of which is on fire, enabling him to set the area around him as well as his victims aflame. 

Bloodborne then released in March 2015, but the Flaming Undead Giant was nowhere to be found in the dungeons. Along with other things such as Boss Rush and the Revered Great One's Coldblood, this version of the Undead Giant was generally declared as ""Unused Content"", that is, not having made the final cut of the game. 

Three years later, on 19th November 2017, a group of Tomb Prospectors, led by KolbrotKommander (the creator of the dungeon) made the impossible discovery by officially sighting the first ever Flaming Undead Giant in a Depth 4 Cursed and Defiled Root Chalice. And so it goes full circle. 

This will have a significant impact on the communities perception on what could still possibly be hidden in the depths of the Tombs beneath Yharnam, so light your torch, and keep hunting!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkMPCScnhpU/sddefault.jpg,0.005402872293093513,0.00032457349583889483,16.646067415730336,0.0009755439341225212,0.0057274457889324075,0.00670298972305493,2017-11-20,04:54:30,Monday,0,8,28,8,24,66,268,5,49,7,1,1,25,0,0,7.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.119184098639002,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The Jurassic Park franchise is so rich in details, characters, and story, fans are bound to dissect so many aspects of it. From the characters to sequels, there have been numerous theories that have popped up over the years. Some of these theories were debunked when Jurassic Park sequels were released while others have been proven to be true or have a lot of evidence associated with them. Come along on a journey to discover these theories and the evidence behind them!

The Indominus Rex may have been labeled as the first true hybrid in Jurassic Park, but there may have been another one introduced way back in Jurassic Park 3. How does Claire and her sister connect to another movie franchise? Just match up the characters and plot to get a better sense of where they have come from. Is Jurassic World connected to the MCU? We may have an answer thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2. The T-rex has survived through multiple films, but does he actually represent a god? Owen had the raptors trained in Jurassic World, but did they actually turn on him for the Indominus Rex or were they just confused? Was a Spinosaurus placed on the island to stop humans from visiting? The connection between The Lost World and Jurassic Park III makes a lot of sense. What famous video game franchise is the whole Jurassic Park franchise connected to? Watch to see all of these theories and several others as you get excited for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

Featuring: 

1. THE FIRST BIG HYBRID
2. ESCAPING THE VILLAGE 
3. A CONNECTION TO THE MCU 
4. THE T-REX IS GOD 
5. DEDICATED RAPTORS 
6. THE SPINOSAURUS SECURITY GUARD 
7. A MARIO CONNECTION
8. THE RAPTOR KID 
9. A NON-CONNECTION TO WESTWORLD 
10. NO DINOSAURS IN JURASSIC PARK

It's called a ""death drop,"" and it's no small feat.

We wanted to better understand this show-stopping maneuver, so we went to RuPaul's DragCon in NYC to ask some of our favorite queens if they could teach us how to master it.

Back at the Choi crib we are just swapping out cars for a change of pace when Alex says he tried to do donuts in his garage with he BMW M2 but couldn't cause it seemed too tight...that's about when I chimed in ""I could do donuts in my Huracan around the pole!"" and Alex replied ""lets see ya do it then!"" Now I'm not sure if this was a dare or joke but I accepted the challenge and some fresh DDE continental tire donuts were baked! Along with some seriously black marks on Mrs.Choi's garage floor which we had to remove after! LMFAO

Torrential rains in a short period of time lead to the flooding ‚Äì a rare phenomenon that has happened at least three times in the last 16 years. Olho D‚Äô√Ågua (""eyes of water‚Äù) is a popular snorkeling spot known for its crystalline waters. The clarity of the river comes from minerals that rapidly take out dirt and impurities as they descend to the bottom. The water receded to its normal level by the end of the day. Recanto Ecol√≥gico Rio da Prata is in Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil‚Äôs pantanal region.

Deadpool 2 was filled with missable references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the DC movies, pop culture, and more! What jokes did you miss in Deadpool? Erik Voss breaks down the movie with a scene-by-scene rewatch, pointing out the subtle details that make the sequel great. What are all the ways the movie references Hugh Jackman and Josh Brolin's careers in movies like X-Men, X-Men Origins, Logan, and Avengers Infinity War? What are all the sneaky celebrity cameos in the movie? How does the movie's opening scene and flashy opening title sequence foreshadow the ending of the movie?

Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ps3vbDXoNdE/sddefault.jpg,0.013018091318081746,0.00026323346415238827,49.45454545454545,0.00045467598353594337,0.013281324782234134,0.013736000765770078,2018-04-18,08:35:01,Wednesday,2,6,31,6,26,47,254,3,61,0,1,6,10,0,0,7.0,7.0,"['ai', '', 'ea', 'eet i', 'easy ‚Äò;', '', 'Porta']","['ai', 'ea', 'eet', 'i', 'easy', '‚Äò;', 'Porta']",True,"['ai', 'ea', 'eet', 'i', 'easi', '‚Äò', ';', 'porta']",8,8,19,1,0,0,1,6.5279534705675815,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Sound-wise, the R&B innovator continues to sanction a string of inventive ideas, and from politics to personal revelations, the album‚Äôs ever-shifting vibe makes each track feel like a new adventure. ‚ÄúPart of this album‚Äôs purpose was finding a balance between being aware of what‚Äôs going on and not letting it weigh me down,‚Äù he told Vevo‚Äôs Anupa Mistry in an exclusive interview. Fans know he‚Äôs a killer performer, so we invited him to take the stage at Elsewhere in Brooklyn to capture four of the new songs live. He was pure fire, as you‚Äôll see with the premieres of ‚ÄúSky Walker,‚Äù ‚ÄúPineapple Skies,‚Äù ""Told You So"" and ""Come Through and Chill.""

While struggling through the wings of death, the comedian pulls back the curtain on the Eric Andre show, discusses his off-piste rap career, and explains the art of wearing a jumpsuit with your face on it. He also tries out some unconventional techniques to tame the heat, including ""weird vitamins"" and a pre-show cryotherapy session. Thanks for rocking with us through 100 episodes, Hot Ones fans!

We got to start with Bey. Obviously. As heart broken as I was that she pulled out of Coachella last year because she had twin fetuses in her belly that needed her attention, I‚Äôm so glad that she came back this year with a vengeance. Beyonce HD. Holy crap. Besides her wardrobe malfunction during her set where her boots fell, essentially sealing the fate that someone what gonna get fired by the end of that number- besides all that- her outfits were perfection! She went from fly girl in yellow to a full fledge Queen with so many jewels on that the weight of them alone made walking on the stage some heavy cardiovascular activity.
Moving on to the next fashionista. Kylie Jenner is to Coachella as Meryl Streep is to the Oscars. Always present and always winning. Where do we begin- the clothes or the wigs? Let‚Äôs do both. King Kylie stayed in a black onesie that somehow only cost $18. If you hurry you can snag it for weekend 2. That hot pink glow in the dark wig looked so good. Her wig game is so strong! Her pink hair looked great against her nude vinyl two piece she wore for the after parties. 
Not to be upstaged, Kendall Jenner always gives us much to look forward to. What was most noticeable is how much her Coachella fashion has evolved throughout the years! Her bohemian style has taken a back seat and a new, rugged, androgynous, Indiana Jones meets Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider meets the choreographer form Meet The Band squished together is what Kendall served us this year. Her waist must be very tan by now because she never covered it.

Next up, Rihanna. Woman, I don‚Äôt even know what to say. The look with the sleeves and the face sweater... didn‚Äôt love. But THIS one: 50 Shades of Brown, with her beautiful breasts on semi display, and then this one- sort of like a modern take on the classical Mexican mariachi outfit- I love ‚Äòem both.
For a girl who puts the ‚Äòchill‚Äô in Coachella- Hailey Baldwin. Though it seemed like everyone got the memo that for 2018 you were supposed to wear white sneakers, a denim bottom, and a white skimpy top, Hailey took hers to the next level by flaunting her assets in this lace white bra top, pear earrings, and vintage cat-eye sunglasses. I dig it.
Our next person deserves some love because he is both nothing like what Coachella stands for and yet everything that Coachella stands for at the same time. Mr. Walmart Yodeling Boy. He made such a splash at the music festival and he did not adjust his style for the fest. He showed up in all his Midwestern glory complete with a giant belt buckle, a cowboy hat, a red bowtie, and a white long sleeve button down shirt in the middle of the desert. I want to be his prom date. In 10 years.
And last but certainly not least can we pay our respects to Teyana Taylor‚Äôs lime green lace Body suit? Girl makes we wanna go to the gym. Teyana was attending a Playboy sponsored party where bunny ears obvi were a must. Combined with the dress and those brightly tinted sunglasses, she wins steamiest outfit of the weekend. Meow!
So many outfits to love. Which one was your favorite? Was there a celeb whose style you loved that wasn‚Äôt included on this list? Because in that case I have been a very bad girl and I‚Äôd like you to tag me in their Instagram pics so I can include them in round two. Hec, if you were at Coachella and YOUR outfit was bomb, tweet me a photo @Miriamisa or on IG @Miriam_isa and I‚Äôll retweet me fave. Then click here to watch what your Coachella outfit says about you! It‚Äôs a parody so don‚Äôt take it too seriously. I‚Äôm you girl Miriam Isa and thanks for subscribing to Clevver News.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

You probably know that Donald Glover is behind the piece ‚ÄúThis is America,‚Äù but do you know how much other content he‚Äôs created? Right out of college he was spotted by Tina Fey, and hired to work on the show 30 Rock. Fans were shocked when he suddenly stopped appearing on the show Community, and wondered if he was doing so in order to dedicate more time to his music career. He creates music using the name ‚ÄúChildish Gambino,‚Äù and wait until you hear where he got that name. This big star likes to stay mum about his personal life, but we do know that he has a partner named Michelle, and two kids. There‚Äôs a lot we don‚Äôt know about this enigmatic star, but we‚Äôll let you in on some of the surprising facts we managed to find.

Hey there, my names Chris Winter and if you're watching this video, there's a good chance you're thinking about buying a Canon 6D Mark ii, so I wanted to give you 5 reasons why I think the Canon 6D Mark ii would be good for you. 

But anyway let's take a look at some of the reasons why you should take a look at this full frame camera from Canon. 

Dual Pixel Autofocus: 

To me, the biggest new feature in the brand new Canon 6D Mark ii is it's inclusion of the Dual Pixel Autofocus system. 

Now if you haven't heard of this before, Dual Pixel autofocus was first introduced in the Canon 70D a few years ago. Before that, autofocus in DSLR was honestly pretty terrible. 

It was stuttery, slow and used to constantly hunt. But that all changed with the 70D and has now since been included in the 80D, 5D and a few other cameras. 

Essentially though with Dual Pixel autofocus you can put your Canon 6D Mark ii pretty much where ever you want and it will smoothly and cinematically come into focus. 

You can also use the touch screen on the back of the screen to pull focus, so wherever your finger touches will come into focus. 

Not only that the Canon 6D Mark ii also has face tracking mode which works really well too. I normally film by myself and in fact I'm actually using it now and you can see that even if I move in or out my face stays in focus. 

Now sure you can still pull focus mainually, which is totally fine, but for a lot of people, having that great autofocus feature will be a life saver. 

Articulating Screen: 

Now I briefly mentioned before that the Canon 6D Mark ii has a new articulating screen but I wanted to talk more about it because to me this is a big inclusion. 

Now for many years pro cameras have shy'd away from including flip screens on their cameras, but I'm so glad that they've included it on the 6D Mark ii. It's fantastic. 

Sure most of the time I'm shooting using the viewfinder, but I have been finding myself more and more these days using the LCD screen on Canon 6D Mark 2 on the back to take shots that I'd normally struggle to get. 

For example taking shots from down low or up high are a lot easier to compose now by simply flipping the screen to your liking. 

And for video work the articulating screen is a must and really makes life a lot easier. If you pair that with the new dual pixel autofocus and it really is useful. 

Speaking about that articulating screen another nice addition is that the screen itself is a touch screen. 

Now I know a lot of professional's and old school photographers might not be used to using a touch screen on their DSLR's but I actually love it and have found it's really sped up my workflow. 

Sure I still use the physical buttons on the side of the Canon 6D Mark 2 and all of the dials on the top, but having the touch screen means I can quickly adjust settings without having to dive deep into the menus. 

Not only that you, but when you do get into the menu it really is a lot easier to move through different sections using just the touch screen. 

For video, the touch screen on the Canon 6D Mark 2 is brilliant. When you pair it up with the fantastic new dual pixel autofocus, you can simply touch on the screen and where ever you touched will smoothly and cinematically come into focus. It's amazing. 

Sure a lot of photographers might not be too quick to appreciate it, but I say give it a go on your Canon 6D Mark 2, and you'll quickly fall in love with how easy it is to use. 

I want to quickly talk about my experience with the battery life on the 6D Mark ii and overall it's been pretty impressive. 

I was able to get about 1100 shots on a single battery charge while shooting stills. When shooting using the LCD battery life wasn't as good but that's to be expected. 

Video battery life is good as well on the Canon 6D Mark 2. Sure it's not as good as say on the Panasonic GH4, but you can get some good run time. 

The 6D Mark ii is still using these LP-E6 batteries which I love. I have heaps of these for my other cameras and I'm glad they're not changing the design with each different model. 

So the Canon 6D Mark ii can shoot at 6.5 frames per second which is pretty good but nothing stellar for a camera in this price range.

Now to be fair this camera isn't a dedicated sports and wildlife camera like the Canon 7D Mark ii or Nikon D500 so you shouldn't expect it to be super fast. 

But honestly for most photography such as weddings and portraits that should be perfectly fine on the Canon 6D Mark 2. 

I've found that the autofocus is definitely improved on the 6D Mark ii compared to the older version. I never really though the mark i was great in that department so it's nice to see some solid speed and accuracy improvements.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pvy4asMXUYE/sddefault.jpg,0.017314453353671794,0.0019067307595813214,9.080701754385963,-3.345141683476004e-06,0.019221184113253117,0.01921783897156964,2018-01-13,01:34:35,Saturday,5,10,49,10,16,44,255,1,34,2,11,9,40,4,0,4.0,4.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.608210323861841,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

A man who cooks for a living but hates eating, serves for a living but hates customers, greets for a living but hates people. He doesn't consider his food art, although it is. Nor would he his restaurants (deceased and half-built), although they are as well. To him they are work, and work is his passion.

In ninety countries around the globe, his food remains the best I've ever had. His restaurant was a temple to the concept of attention to detail. He calls the one he's building a castle. I'm certain it will live up to the name.

Hello everyone! Thanks for tuning in, thought I'd pop in to add that I'm a fan of Jenn which is why I was so keen to support EGGIE and this is just based on my personal experience. My second order reached me within 5 working days, even though I didn't receive any tracking number or updates on it, I thought the shipping and processing time was really quick! So it's really just my luck to have encountered the rude customer service officer. üòì

1) We all know that movies like The Post and Call Me By Your Name will be nominated for Oscars, but what do you wanna see get nominated that barely has any chance?

2) For you, what is ‚Äústyle over substance‚Äù and is it a valid criticism?

3) Should Star Wars: Episode IX be broken into two movies as the end of Episode VIII has opened up so many possibilities for storytelling and also opened up many questions to be answered?

4) Do you think that the Avengers: Infinity War will beat Star Wars: The Force Awakens box office records?

5) If there was a movie made about Collider which actors/actresses would play the Collider crew?

Choreography by Brian Esperon
Filmed at SKIP Entertainment on Guam

Dancers:
Asia Arizala, Veronica Calvo, Isabelle Castro, Bailey Concepcion, Sabrina Cruz, Lauryn Fernandez, Tori Montinola, Gabby Sablan,

Anyone else obsessed with this song/Ariana/the album art/the music video? I'm sure you guys are used to hearing me say this, but we put this together in under an hour and let me tell you it was not easy. We rarely use props, but last year we did a dance with umbrellas and they have been at our studio ever since. I ended up using similar visuals from ""River"" but it's totally a different dance when paired with this song. I love how this song is both sad and uplifting at the same time. Choreographing with an umbrella is really hard and dancing with it is probably even harder (especially when you buy cheap ones and half of them are broken). Hope these short videos are okay! Still trying to find time to make videos for you guys since we're really busy preparing for our annual concert and competitions.

Also! If you guys could share the video and tag Ariana on any social media platforms, that would be great! She's looking for dance videos put on her youtube and it would be great to be a part of it! Thanks as always!!!

Perhaps the dropping temps across the nation prompted these stars to pull out their best Winter hues. Selena Gomez tops our Best Dressed list in this edgy black leather minidress that fits like. a. glove. But once your eyes move upward and you confirm this is IN FACT Selena Gomez, you realize she‚Äôs gone BLONDE. And you know what? She totally rocks it. Rocking it seems to the be theme of SelGo‚Äôs look because from the pose, the clutch, the heels, and the red lips Selena looks like a total rockstar.

Demi Lovato, on the other hand, showed up as the definition of seduction. Demetria looks stunning in a full-length sheer black gown that shows off her curves PERFECTLY. Demi completed the vampy look with gorgeous long black mermaid hair. 

Keeping with the raven theme is Diana Ross. We are LIVING for her spunky black strapless dress and floral shaped headdress and veil. When you‚Äôre Diana-freaking-Ross, an ensemble like this is only fitting.

No, we didn‚Äôt leave the fellas out. Niall Horan is next on our Best-Dressed list confidently wearing a blue plaid 3-piece-suit. We gotta say, he‚Äôs looking quite dapper on the carpet and we can‚Äôt help but wonder if Niall‚Äôs looking to impress some of his female counterparts at the show.

Shawn Mendes also makes our list in this all-black look with a bold grey patterned blazer. Is it just us‚Ä¶ or does Shawn appear to be all GROWN UP overnight?!

Hailee Steinfeld also got the black memo, but took a page out of Lady Gaga‚Äôs notebook. She looks stunning in a high-shouldered black blazer, black trousers, and black leather crop top. Honestly, it‚Äôs hard for Hailey to ever look bad on a red carpet.

Finally, Lea Michele rounds out our list taking a trip to the softer side. Lea chose a baby pink corset halter gown looking like a total princess. 

Okay guys, who do you think was the absolute BEST DRESSED on the AMAs red carpet this year? Tell us your vote below in the comment section. As always I‚Äôm your girl Sinead de Vries I‚Äôll see ya next time.

""My Own Grave"" music video directed by Josh Knoff.

------

AS I LAY DYING comments, ""We are tremendously grateful to have found positive resolve from the worst moments of our history. The previous chapter of our journey was one of pervasive hurt and pain. Subsequent years found us on varied paths‚Äîall of which slowly led towards resolutions of growth, healing, and reconciliation. AS I LAY DYING's collective purpose is to share a message of hope for everyone through the empowering outlet of music, and we are humbled by the overwhelming support we have received from family, friends, and fans so far.

We are honored to join forces with Nuclear Blast Worldwide in releasing our new album Shaped By Fire. Their legacy and contribution to the heavy music scene is undeniably incredible and we are proud to call their label home. We are thankful for their support and enthusiasm and together we look forward to sharing the best AILD record yet!

In conjunction with our new album announcement, we are excited to share a music video for the title track 'Shaped by Fire.' While lyrically akin to the other Shaped By Fire single releases 'My Own Grave' and 'Redefined', we explored some different musical territory to incorporate within our established sound. We‚Äôd like to thank our director Mathis Arnell, all of the crew, and actors that contributed to making this video with us under the very hot conditions!

We look forward to seeing our fans out on the road as we embark on the Latin American, European, and US tours before closing the book on 2019.""

Shaped By Fire was produced by the band and was mixed by Joseph McQueen at Sparrow Sound in Los Angeles, CA while mastering was completed by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in Nashville, TN. The only exception was for the track ‚ÄúMy Own Grave‚Äù which was produced by AS I LAY DYING, co-produced by Drew Fulk and mixed by Adam ‚ÄúNolly‚Äù Getgood. The artwork was created by Corey Meyers.

""MY OWN GRAVE"" LYRICS

the lies, the weight, deceit, decay

the lies, the weight
it‚Äôs clear i lost my way
deceit, decay
decomposing

i thought i was an architect but i was just moving dirt
stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt
i hadn‚Äôt been building (building)
the time was spent digging (digging)
boring the barriers that kept others away (away)
the deeper the walls the less anyone could hear (hear me) fall

so now i know there is no one else to blame

buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive inside of my own grave
inside of my own grave

beneath my lies
delusional enough to think i‚Äôd designed something great
like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate
i hadn‚Äôt been building (building)
the time was spent digging (digging)
an ugly truth from which there was no way to escape (escape)
nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what i‚Äôd become

buried alive inside of my own grave (my grave)
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive inside of my own grave (my grave)
what i‚Äôd become
buried alive inside my own grave

beneath my pride crushing me
beneath my lies collapsing
but we are still alive
we are still alive

buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive inside of my own grave
MY OWN GRAVE
buried alive inside of my own grave
and there's no one else to blame
the lies and the weight, i know i lost my way (my way)
what i‚Äôd become
buried alive inside of my own grave (my grave)
and there's no one else to blame
buried alive‚Ä¶ buried alive

finally forced to face what i‚Äôd become
what i‚Äôd become in my own grave (buried)
in my own grave (alive)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0wbyQRRQJA/sddefault.jpg,0.010224244846227738,0.00030650855192469707,33.35712749946248,0.000965459102493402,0.010530753398152437,0.011496212500645836,2018-06-08,00:18:21,Friday,4,11,93,11,33,52,474,3,49,7,16,4,90,4,20,4.0,4.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.593699441993103,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Letra:
Que falsedad, que por ser tan iguales 
no podamos estar juntos 
entonces la necesidad, de estar busc√°ndonos 
de donde sale, ese es el punto 

Pero hay algo en ti que me atrae 
problemas me trae, lo mismo a ti te pasa 
tus noches son iguales y por ser tan iguales 
es que no, podemos estar juntos (estar juntos) 

Seg√∫n tu, seg√∫n yo 
no estamos minti√©ndonos, minti√©ndonos 
tu me ves con otra, yo te veo con otro 
queriendo estar desvisti√©ndonos, haci√©ndolo (x2) 

Que mal, que no eres la oficial 
pero cuando estoy bellaco te llamo, eso es oficial 
estamos chingando desde que escuchamos se√±ora oficial 
vuelve de Don Omar, esto no se va acabar 

Sigue, sigue, no te olvides 
un polvo as√≠, no se consigue 
encima de este bicho es que tu vives 
como Selena en el de Justin Bieber

Como la yerba y snoop, como en youtube 
basurita y leleput, descarada tu y yo, yo y tu 
el coraz√≥n se me quiere salir del pecho, espejos en el techo 
para ver como reacciona cuando adentro se la hecho 
soy el m√°s cabr√≥n que te la hecho, de echo 

Seg√∫n tu, seg√∫n yo 
no estamos minti√©ndonos, minti√©ndonos 
tu me ves con otra, yo te veo con otro 
queriendo estar desvistiendonos, haciendolo (x2) 

Ella esta con otro, pero pendiente a todo lo que hago yo 
yo pendiente a todos las fotos que en el instagram subi√≥ 
de la historia que ella postio, el ultimo mio se que lo vio 
como lo se, por que a jangueo llego 

Polos opuestos, polos iguales, yo no lo se, tu tampoco lo sabes 
ese problema no es grave, de este bloqueo tenemos la clave 
un d√≠a chingamos, al otro no hablamos, despu√©s nos extra√±os 
de ah√≠ volvemos y empezamos 

Yo se que tu eres capaz, de poner este fin de semana 
que tu relaci√≥n esta complicada, por que sabes que soy capaz 
sabes que estas sola y no tienes a nadie, claro que voy a llegar 
yo se donde tu estas, deja la llave afuera encaletada 

Seg√∫n tu, seg√∫n yo 
no estamos minti√©ndonos, minti√©ndonos 
tu me ves con otra, yo te veo con otro 
queriendo estar desvisti√©ndonos, haci√©ndolo (x2)

We used the recipe over at  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24272/buttery-soft-pretzels/ For the Mickey Premium Bars we just kinda winged it and used vanilla ice cream, magic shell and craft sticks! All in all we had a really fun night trying to replicate these iconic Mickey shaped snacks! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission, led and operated by MIT and managed by Goddard. With the help of a gravitational assist from the Moon, the spacecraft will settle into  a 13.7-day orbit around Earth. 

Four wide-field cameras will give TESS a field-of-view that covers 85 percent of the entire sky. Within this vast visual perspective, the sky has been divided into 26 sectors that TESS will observe one by one. The first year of observations will map the 13 sectors encompassing the southern sky, and the second year will map the 13 sectors of the northern sky. 
 
The spacecraft will be looking for a phenomenon known as a transit, where a planet passes in front of its star, causing a periodic and regular dip in the star‚Äôs brightness. NASA‚Äôs Kepler spacecraft used the same method to spot more than 2,600 confirmed exoplanets, most of them orbiting faint stars 300 to 3,000 light-years away 
 
TESS will concentrate on stars less than 300 light-years away and 30 to 100 times brighter than Kepler‚Äôs targets. The brightness of these target stars will allow researchers to use spectroscopy, the study of the absorption and emission of light, to determine a planet‚Äôs mass, density and atmospheric composition. Water and other key molecules in its atmosphere can give us hints about a planet's capacity to harbor life.

~~I am the creator and original uploader of this mashup~~

ok so wow, this mashup went crazy popular and I can't thank you guys enough, I had no idea people would love it so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this mashup started out as something I did for fun, I wasn't even planning on posting it when I started making it.

(because my last mashup was a gimme more mashup and I've already made a few gimme more mashups) (I don't want my videos to get too repetitive) (especially since I don't post often)

but I really wanted to share this mashup,

so to compensate for my videos' repetitiveness, I made an album cover for this mashup (inspired by Britney's 'Blackout' album) and put it over an animated backdrop :)

Ingredients:
¬ª Ariana Grande - Step On Up (DIY Acapella)
¬ª Britney Spears - Gimme More (Instrumental Stems + Official Instrumental)

In fact, around 70 billion dollars‚Äô worth of presents are returned every year in the U.S. In this video, The Atlantic writer Derek Thompson explains why many presents amount to what economists call ‚Äúdeadweight loss‚Äù: the company wasted time making it, the giver wasted time buying it, and the receiver wasted time returning it.

So, how do we design a gift-giving formula that strikes the right balance between efficient, practical, and sentimental?

LYRICS:

When I run from the blame,
Hide from the pain,
I feel it in my body.

When I just can‚Äôt let go,
Fear starts to show,
I feel it in my body.

Oh I feel this Magic,
And it‚Äôs deep inside.
Cause I believe in Magic,
When I see your eyes.
You know that it‚Äôs Magic.
Cause I believe in Magic.

When I‚Äôm numb from the game,
Tired of the blame,
I feel it in my body.

When I just can‚Äôt say no,
Fear starts to show,
I feel it in my body.

Oh I feel this Magic,
And it‚Äôs deep inside.
Cause I believe in Magic,
When I see your eyes.
You know that it‚Äôs Magic.
Cause I believe in Magic.

The full guide is on the blog:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/ultimate-tokyo-japan-food-guide-where-and-what-to-eat/

As one of the largest cities in the world and a super metropolis at that, there are over 160,000 restaurants to choose from.  With limited time in Tokyo, the challenge then becomes picking which ones to go to on your visit.  The other challenge is that there are also so many different types of food as well so you have to think strategically.  While I certainly didn't get even close to going to all the food spots we had planned, I was very happy with all the restaurants we went to.  What I've done is put together a top 9 list for all the amazing food we had and a behind the scenes look at why you should go and order.  

Here are all of the restaurants that are featured in this video:

Iggy Azalea split up with her ex Nick Young back in June of 2016 after he admitted to cheating on her in a leaked video and catching him in security footage with another girl while she was away.

After being super open about the fact that she burned his clothes, she explained how it all went down in the moment saying QUOTE, 

The interview continued with a question regarding the rumors that Iggy collabed with Selena Gomez on a song called ‚ÄòGirl Crush‚Äô

Back in October 2015 Iggy tweeted in response to a question about working with Selena QUOTE, ‚Äúi did a song for her a while ago but she didn‚Äôt release it, it was called girl crush. shes great.‚Äù

And now Iggy is giving us a little more confirmation regarding the song.

So now we‚Äôre just curious as to what happened and why the song will never be released!? And what would an Iggy/Selena song even sound like? Let us know your thoughts on all that AND whether Nick Young got what he deserved in the comments below and then click right over here to check out the weekly Daily Hollywood Rundown.

Besides salt, pepper, and salmon, there's only THREE ingredients: Thai sweet chili sauce, large grain mustard, and samba oelek, which is basically just a chili paste. 

According to Sports Illustrated, this is Lebron James's go-to game day meal. It involves a super-citrusy sauce with lots of lime juice, plus some Sriracha and a little honey. He keeps it simple with the salmon: seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and seared on both sides.

Join us as we travel from Singapore to Hong Kong in style and luxury in Singapore Airlines‚Äô brand new Airbus A380 first class suite.

We start at the exclusive first class check in area of Changi airport in Singapore and we‚Äôre bowled over by the professional and courteous nature of the staff who work seamlessly and efficiently to get us through check in and immigration control and in to the first class lounge in less than five minutes! Changi airport has been rated as the best airport in the world by Skytrax for seven consecutive years since 2013 and with the service we received, it‚Äôs not surprising to see why!

We receive an exclusive invitation to the private room which is the flagship first class lounge of Singapore airlines. It is ultra exclusive and private with top class, restaurant style a la carte and buffet dining, large screen televisions and extremely comfortable seating. It even has a shower suite for first class passengers to freshen up before their flight! Come with us and see inside the magnificent Singapore airlines private room and all it has to offer ‚Äì we also examine the exquisite food, and the service to go with it, provided in the private room.

We‚Äôve already been pampered and enjoyed significant luxury but what lies in store for us on board the Airbus A380 of Singapore Airlines is incredible! Our first class suite on board the aeroplane is very spacious and we are greeted with a choice of vintage champagnes ‚Äì Krug 2004 or Dom Perignon Vintage 2009. The first class suite is so big and so private that you don‚Äôt even have to go to the bathroom to get changed in to your complimentary, soft pyjamas and slippers! 

We take an in depth look at the long haul amenity kits provided by Singapore airlines, which are handcrafted by Lalique in men‚Äôs women‚Äôs and unisex varieties. We see the great attention to detail that has been paid with perfumes, hand creams, moisturisers and lip balm all being provided as well as a precious Lalique glass ornament to keep and cherish.

We also take a good look at the sophisticated food and drink served on board, brought directly to us at our own personal table within the first class cabin, expertly laid at our request by the stewardess. We are treated to a selection of exotic fruits as an appetiser, iced milo, lobster thermidor and for dessert, a scrumptious and expertly presented mont-blanc cake with ice cream.

The first class cabin‚Äôs furnishings are no less impressive with movable lights, a seat which wouldn‚Äôt look out of place in Stat Trek, giving complete control over all of the cabin‚Äôs functions, including the blinds and a bed with proper mattress and super soft linen and padding.

Overall, as we arrive in Hong Kong, we are well rested, well fed and ready for a lot more fun in Hong Kong, which is where I, Sam Chui, first developed my love of aviation and I discuss this with the cabin crew during the video.

Stepping off the plane, we are greeted by the Silver Kris Lounge of Hong Kong international airport and in case you didn‚Äôt have enough to eat on your flight, you won‚Äôt be wanting with the fabulous choice of both western and Chinese food available including the famous Wonton noodle soup.

So come with us from Singapore to Hong Kong on the A380 with Singapore airlines and enjoy all they have to offer ‚Äì what, in your opinion, was the best part of the trip? Let us know in the comments and, as always, thanks for watching!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QE9SJ7er2Ac/sddefault.jpg,0.009599088095165844,0.00040645009559068976,23.616892207186183,0.0006167875458987043,0.010005538190756532,0.010622325736655235,2018-05-11,12:22:49,Friday,4,11,19,11,12,64,148,1,19,6,1,4,19,2,0,5.0,7.0,"['7540.0) aaa', '= LASS SUITE A']","['7540.0)', 'aaa', '=', 'LASS', 'SUITE', 'A']",True,"['7540.0', ')', 'aaa', '=', 'lass', 'suit', 'A']",7,7,20,2,1,1,1,6.840884557285763,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'vase': 1, 'tv': 1, 'person': 1}",3

First of all, I loved The Karate Kid, and I loved Cobra Kai. Mr. Miyagi was the perfect father figure and I always loved the fact that they emphasized Okinawa as the birthplace of karate. This is just an alternative view from Johnny's perspective. A lot of people have sympathy for Daniel I felt for him too, being the new kid. I just never believed Johnny would lose to such an obvious kick. Johnny was a legit black belt, no one even scored a point on him in the year before and Daniel was a guy who trained with the janitor in the backyard a couple of months - most of which time he was washing cars, painting, and sanding. I was just out of the Marines when this movie came out and was working as an assistant karate instructor at Jennings Karate Academy in San Clemente and was attending tournaments throughout southern California. It always seemed ridiculous to me that Johnny fell for that kick. It would be like a beginner with two months training beating Johnny Gyro and the whole USA karate team in their prime. Agree? Disagree?Ôªø

""To clear a few thing up from the comments. I am NOT saying Daniel is a Bully and Johnny a guiltless hero. I guess you could call Johnny a bully but on the bully scale he is very mild. Every action has some sort of cause and effect issue and most hard core bullies seem to have no reason other than opportunity to shame, harm or take from a victim. The point of the video is not who is and who is not a bully - rather no one is ALL good or ALL bad. The part about throwing the fight is from the pure and simple fact that Johnny was by far a superior fighter.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QETwgw30jSA/sddefault.jpg,0.009252871456296876,0.0003943774002863958,23.461971830985927,0.0014519753864065332,0.00964724885658327,0.011099224242989805,2018-06-04,01:58:11,Monday,0,6,5,6,5,36,37,1,10,0,0,6,5,1,0,5.0,7.0,"['eA', '', 'The JOHNNY LAWRENCE Story', '', 'Coss AL']","['eA', 'The', 'JOHNNY', 'LAWRENCE', 'Story', 'Coss', 'AL']",True,"['eA', 'the', 'johnni', 'lawrenc', 'stori', 'coss', 'AL']",7,7,29,0,1,0,1,6.656476912203021,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

3) Are you a serial re-watcher of lots of movies or do you only watch something once or twice because it‚Äôs not as interesting as watching something new?

4) Looking ahead to 2018, if you had to place a bet on the highest box earner of the year right now, what movie would it be?

5) Do you think that Rian Johnson should have stayed on for 9 or are you glad that JJ is coming back to finish what he started?

INGREDIENTS:
Red Bean Steamed Buns
3 cups unbleached all purpose flour
1 packet activated yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 tsp baking powder
12 ounces red bean paste

Mix your packet of activated yeast with warm to hot water (100-110 degrees F) until it‚Äôs completely dissolved, and set aside for 10 minutes to let rise.

Combine all of your dry ingredients in a mixer or stand mixer. Pour in your yeast slowly as you stir and mix. Continue to mix until it becomes a dough. Flour out a surface, knead the dough a little bit and form it into a ball. Place your dough in an oiled bowl and cover with seran wrap and let rest for 1 hour.

When the dough has doubled in size, pour it out and punch the air out and continue kneading for a couple of minutes on a floured surface. Roll the dough into a log about 1-2 inches thick in diameter. Cut the log into 8 sections and use a rolling pin or your hands to flatten out each chunk into small round discs.

Take your red bean paste and scoop one tbsp into the middle. Carefully fold the sides of the dough together and work your way around to wrapping it fully, then turn them over and place into a bamboo steamer or regular steamer. This is a really tough and complicated process, so you can watch our original video on how to make Dragon Dumplings, or check out a tutorial like this one:
https://youtu.be/WclLg8M0tJ8?t=2m45s

Bring your stove of water to boil then place your buns on top, steaming for 20-25 minutes. Carefully monitor the size to know when it‚Äôs ready! Serve hot.

Moon Byul already showed her unlimited potential to develop in music as she was recognized with her powerful rap skills, performances and sensitive skills to make raps as a member of MAMAMOO. In this album, she has come to the fans as an all-around musician by showing her stable singing skills. In the music video of the same title track as the album ‚ÄòSELFISH‚Äô, she plays a sloppy character with cute confidence and her lovely image as if she‚Äôs in clothes that suits her makes us make a smile like her mom.

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

The FedEx St. Jude Classic returns to TPC Southwind in Memphis, TN. In 2017, Daniel Berger shot a second-straight 66 to repeat as champion after having won there in 2016. He beat Charl Schwatzel and Whee Kim by a single stroke and returns in 2018 to defend his title yet again.

Official Trailer 2 - http://www.pacificrimmovie.com 

The globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising. 

John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave his life to secure humanity‚Äôs victory against the monstrous ‚ÄúKaiju.‚Äù Jake has since abandoned his training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father‚Äôs legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)‚Äîwho is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. 

Jake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious‚Äô Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. 

Pacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix‚Äôs Daredevil, STARZ‚Äôs Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day.

""It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas"" Lyrics:

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

Sure it's Christmas once more...

From the Megane RS Press Release: 

The All-New Renault M√©gane R.S. has been eagerly awaited by sports driving enthusiasts. Just like its predecessors, the M√©gane R.S. is aiming to become a benchmark in the C-segment hot hatch market. The third generation M√©gane R.S. is packed full of Renault Sport expertise and passion.

Driven by its powerful design and focused on performance, All-New Renault M√©gane R.S. makes no attempt to hide its motorsport pedigree, offering outstanding driving pleasure on the road and on the track.

Unique in class 4CONTROL four-wheel steering system ensures stability at high speeds and agility at low speeds ‚Äì at high speeds, the front and rear wheels turn in the same direction, limited to a one degree angle for the rear wheels and at low speeds, the front and rear wheels turn in opposite directions up to a maximum angle of 2.7 degrees

Hydraulic bump stops all round enable optimum control of tyre-ground contact and increased ride comfort

The world‚Äôs most powerful 1.8-litre engine delivers 280hp and 390Nm of torque thanks to the development work jointly carried out by engineers from Renault Sport Cars and Renault Sport Racing

The option of an Efficient Dual Clutch (EDC) gearbox is available for the first time, alongside a manual transmission

Two types of chassis are available ‚Äì Sport or Cup. The Sport chassis provides easy sporty driving, with best-in-class efficiency, whilst the Cup chassis offers greater sports performance for track and fast road use

The new R.S. Monitor Expert allows drivers to film their track sessions and overlay telemetry data to create augmented reality videos that can later be analysed on the R.S. Replay website

The unique R.S. Vision lighting system with chequered flag design integrates the side lights, cornering lights, fog lights & high beam into one housing in the front bumper.

1) ‚ÄòDie Hard‚Äô, ‚ÄòTitanic‚Äô, ‚ÄòMemento‚Äô, ‚ÄòSuperman,‚Äô ‚ÄòGoonies,‚Äô ‚ÄòField of Dreams,‚Äô and More Added to National Film Registry

2) SAG Award Nominations Announced

4) ‚ÄòAnnihilation': Terrifying New Trailer Further Reveals Alex Garland‚Äôs Surreal Sci-Fi

5) First Trailer Released for Clint Eastwood‚Äôs 15:17 to Paris

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

Every December, the National Film Preservation Board announces the 25 films that will be added to the National Film Registry. These films were deemed to be ‚Äúculturally, historically or aesthetically‚Äù significant, and must have been released at least 10 years ago. This year the bigger films included are Die Hard, Ace in the Hole, Dumbo, Field of Dreams, 4 Little Girls, The Goonies, Guess Who‚Äôs Coming to Dinner, Memento, Only Angels Have Wings, Spartacus, Superman, and Titanic.

2017 SAG AWARDS NOMINATIONS - Mark Ellis leads the panel in a discussion about the 2017 SAG Awards Nominations.

As with any new Star Wars movie released by Disney, die-hard fans of the Saga usually want to know what the creator himself, George Lucas, thinks about the new movie - seeing as he is no longer creatively involved in the series. So for those hoping and wishing for the stamp of approval on The Last Jedi, get excited. According to THR, Lucas recently screened the highly anticipated 8th installment of the franchise and told THR through a statement that he thought it was ""beautifully made.‚Äù

Paramount Pictures has released a new Annihilation trailer for the highly anticipated follow-up from Ex Machina writer/director Alex Garland. Based on Jeff VanderMeer‚Äôs eco-horror novel of the same name, the film stars Natalie Portman as a biologist whose husband is recruited on a secret mission, then comes back unrecognizable.

Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow have debuted the first trailer for Clint Eastwood‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris;‚Äù a film that tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act stopped a terrorist attacked on a train to Paris, France.

Ants vs. Spiders is an episode many of you have been asking for! Today our fire ants, a colony known as the Fire Nation, goes head to head with a team of eight giant orb weaver spiders. The spiders were introduced into the enclosure of the fire ants as an attempt to try to eliminate all escaping fire ants as well as reproductive fire ants that fly. Watch the action unfold as two notorious and favourited arthropods come face to face! It gets intense, especially when we meet the previously unintroduced goddess of the 'Antiverse'!

What story am I talking about? Did you guess IT by Stephen King? Or maybe A Wrinkle In Time by Madeleine L'Engle? Well, loyal Theorists, it's BOTH!! Today I'm going to tell you how Stephen King STOLE his multiverse from A Wrinkle In Time.

Review: My favourite things, the lipstick, the lip liner, the white eyeliner and the LIQUID EYE LINER!! It was unreal and it all lasted so well, I can't stop using those three products! The eyeshadow palettes are expensive for what they are, its a lovely collection and everything wore really well but those four things are definitely worth it angels!!!! Ps outside of the collection, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE CONTOUR STICK!! Not muddy at all! And the concealer is one of my favourite concealers ever from maybelline! 


I love you with all my heart, my soul and EVERYTHING I have to love with. Thank you for you unconditional support, you're all my huns forever xxx

Straight and to the point.

For this edit I really tried to hammer home an upbeat, action-packed feeling (as it's only cut to one song) but I think in the process I may have lost some of the quiet intensity a lot of films had this year. 

That's all I've got for notes. Sorry if your favorite film didn't make the cut (it might just be hidden in there somewhere).

[WHY ASIANS ARE 'CUTER' (SCIENTIFIC BREAKDOWN)]

So, here‚Äôs a statement: ‚ÄòAsians are cuter‚Äô. 

If you were offended by that, this video is probably not what you think. Everyone has their own opinions of what constitutes as attractive. 

But I‚Äôm not necessarily talking about ‚Äòattractiveness‚Äô here; I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äòcuteness‚Äô. Cuteness is a term describing a type of attractiveness commonly associated with youth and appearance. It‚Äôs also a scientific concept. So when I say ‚ÄòAsians are cuter‚Äô, well, they arguably are; and that‚Äôs including males, not just females.

Now, compared to adults, common features for infants across all ethnic groups include larger heads, flatter faces, reduction of the brow ridge, hairlessness, thinner bones, reduced muscle mass, smaller physical size, shorter arms, shorter legs, just to name a few - and of course this is largely why people find babies cute. If they didn‚Äôt have these features and proportions, they‚Äôd more so resemble miniature adults and that‚Äôs kind of creepy. 

The video covers:
- Neoteny in East Asians
- How retention of neotenous, childlike traits relate to ethnicity
- Neoteny in humans in general
- Sexual attraction to neotenous traits
- Asian fever vs Cuteness fever
- Neotenous features vs Non-neotenous features
- Gene Mutations that gave East Asians their distinctive appearance
- Neoteny's role in sexual selection
- Are small and slanted stereotypical 'Asian Eyes' neotenous?
- Japan's kawaii culture (South Korea & China as well)
- Psychological neoteny
- Logan Paul's immature antics
- & more!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPrP3Y4SO_E/sddefault.jpg,0.02849986867792516,0.0026486444041903924,10.760171744019628,0.00845876622233775,0.031148513082115564,0.039607279304453305,2018-02-11,17:13:37,Sunday,6,7,68,7,44,56,535,4,89,0,0,7,0,2,5,7.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.290625742524887,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{},0

Camila Cabello performed ‚ÄúNever Be the Same‚Äù LIVE on the Tonight Show and her voice sounded unreal. This episode is brought to you by TurboTax. Relax, there‚Äôs Turbo Tax.

This could easily be her best vocal performance yet. 

Camila made her live vocal performance debut of her latest single, ‚ÄúNever Be the Same‚Äù last night on the Tonight Show and it was BOMB. 

I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb here and say that I think this was Camila‚Äôs best vocal performance yet. ‚ÄúNever Be the Same‚Äù is not an easy song to sing at all so the fact that she sounded exactly like the track and wasn‚Äôt lip synching is impressive. Girlfriend has been KILLIN it lately with ‚ÄúHavana‚Äù dominating the Billboard charts, now ‚ÄúNever Be the Same‚Äù is steadily climbing, and her debut solo album, Camila, comes out tomorrow. It‚Äôs safe to say that Camila is having a solid 2018. 

Following her performance on the Tonight Show, Camila posted a video on her socials saying that the performance was her favorite thing she‚Äôs ever done and she hopes we enjoy it. She allowed her voice to shine by keeping the production simple with mirrors framing the stage while images of flowers, city streets, herself, brutal storms and Marilyn Monroe flashed in the background. Also her outfit was bomb, she did that. 

What did you guys think of Camila‚Äôs performance? Sound off in the comment section below and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe.

Here‚Äôs what happened: the Billboard Music Awards people were like- yo! Between Meghan and Harry‚Äôs wedding and 13 Reasons Why and Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, we gotta bring our A-game this year. And they delivered! Amazing performances, outfits, camera cut-aways to celebs being adorable, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs an awards show so let‚Äôs talk winners. Kendrick Lamar, whom had an astounding 15 noms, walked away with a very impressive 6 wins including Top Rap Artist though this all went down in the non televised portion of the show. Boo. Our boy Ed Sheeran also came in with 15 nominations and walked out with awards including the coveted Top Artist, where he beat out his buddy Tay Tay. But all good. After her 2 year awards show hiatus, Taylor Swift also came out a winner in the Top Female category as well as Top Selling Album for Reputation. Speaking of Taylor, she and Camila Cabello looked the cutest of besties the whole night and Tay was definitely very happy for her girl when Camila took the prize for Billboard Chart Achievement Award. 

Khalid earned his spot as the Top New Artist. To no one‚Äôs surprise BTS beat out Ariana, Demi, Shawn Mendes and Bieber for Top Social Artist. And while Bruno Mars slayed virtually every R&B category, Cardi B was awarded Best Rap Female Artist. Other big winners include Post Malone, Imagine Dragons, the song Despacito, because of course. And finally- Janet Jackson. Yes, THE Janet Jackson who not ONLY became the first black woman to win the Icon Award but the 52 year old icon gave one hell of a comeback performance. 

And finally, let‚Äôs just agree that Kelly Clarkson gets to win best host for generally kicking all kinds of ass as the funniest, most adorable, most musical host in Billboard recent history.

That‚Äôs it for winners, yall. Now that you‚Äôre warmed up click here for the best moments because we are just getting started. And of course don‚Äôt forget to follow me on the socials @Miriamisa on Twitter @Miriam_isa on IG. Or don‚Äôt but that would be very uncool. I‚Äôm Miriam Isa and thanks as always for subscribing and catching up on all things awards shows with Clevver.

Sick Boy Lyrics :

[Verse 1]
I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Verse 2]
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us
This is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, this is us
This is us, this is

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
And they call me the sick boy

[Refrain]
Don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Bridge]
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself on my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm from the east side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I'm from the east side of America
They say that I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

From stuffed-crust pizza to the chain's legendary pan pie, our heroes learn how to make a couple of pizza-party classics without calling up the delivery guy. Then, as an ode to some of the chain's wild, international pizza offerings, Falco unveils a chorizo-topped taco pie with ""nacho-bite"" crust. Made with butter-filled dough and heaps of melted mozzarella, these throwback menu items open a portal to the pizza-party heydays of 1995. Will Andrew and Sean quit their day jobs to become fast-food pizzaiolos, or ruin their next dinner with some lack-luster cheesy crust? Watch an all new, nostalgia-packed episode of SITW and find out. And for those watching at home without a slice in hand, take comfort in the wise words of Andrew W.K.: ""Every party is a pizza party, even if there isn't pizza there.""

In 2017, hackers Rick Rolled a voting machine in Las Vegas. Even though the machine was out-of-date and the demonstration didn‚Äôt replicate real-life conditions, the stunt brought national attention to an election crisis that has been building ever since the ‚Äúhanging chad‚Äù fiasco that occurred during the 2000 Presidential election recount.

In her story on American election security, ProPublica‚Äôs Kate Rabinowitz revealed that many state and local election officials are suffering a funding crisis. Without the money needed to maintain and update electronic voting machines, officials are having to make do with equipment that was manufactured in 2008 or even earlier. At that time, most machines had recently been replaced thanks to the 2002 Help America Vote Act, but few have been updated since. 

By isolating machines from the internet and keeping them in secure locations, officials are able to reduce the threat of widespread hacking, but the machines are plagued with more mundane technical problems that states have been slow to address and could have major consequences for future elections.

On the bright side, the omnibus spending bill that was passed in March 2018 allocated $380 million dollars for state election officials to update their voting infrastructure. Whether that money is actually provided and how it will be spent, however, remains to be seen.

The program is taped live before a concert audience from The Moody Theater in downtown Austin. ACL is the longest-running music series in American television history and remains the only TV series to ever be awarded the National Medal of Arts. Since its inception, the groundbreaking music series has become an institution that's helped secure Austin's reputation as the Live Music Capital of the World. The historic KLRU Studio 6A, home to 36 years of ACL concerts, has been designated an official Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Landmark. In 2011, ACL moved to the new venue ACL Live at The Moody Theater in downtown Austin. ACL received a rare institutional Peabody Award for excellence and outstanding achievement in 2012. ACL is produced by KLRU-TV and funding is provided in part by Dell, the Austin Convention Center Department, Shiner Beers and HomeAway.com.

This film is based on the life of John Nash who is the Nobel laureate in economics. This character is portrayed by Russell Crowe one of the leading and famous actors from Wellington, New Zealand. In this film, John Nash will be a sufferer of paranoid schizophrenia and displays all the symptoms accurately.  
Taking this movie as a reference one can easily understand the risk and the pain involved in the so-called disorder schizophrenia. Also, this movie is a perfect example of how an individual might suffer without the help of professionals (doctors) and the treatments.
This video is a sum of all the major symptoms evolved in schizophrenia which would be very helpful for the people who is searching for the details of the symptoms and the severity of the disorder who are not much aware of this mental illness.

I see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair
Sometimes I still pretend you‚Äôre there
It hits me without warning, your reflection walking by
But I know it‚Äôs only in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA, Sam Smith, & Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I‚Äôve been missin'?
Won‚Äôt you give me the part of myself that I can‚Äôt give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I‚Äôve been missin'?
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôd kill for you, and darlin' you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA, Sam Smith, & Both]
So I‚Äôll light up a cigarette
I‚Äôll drink it down ‚Äòtil there‚Äôs nothin' left
‚ÄòCause I sure can‚Äôt get no sleep
And Lord knows there‚Äôs no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can‚Äôt get no sleep
And I sure won‚Äôt, I sure won‚Äôt find no peace
No peace

[Verse 2: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
All that I am askin' is for a little clarity
That‚Äôs all that really matters to me
In and out of focus, tears are in my eyes

I used to find comfort in your arms
Caught up in the wonder of your charms
Oh, I‚Äôll cry for you, I‚Äôll cry for you
I‚Äôll lie for you, I‚Äôll lie for you
But I don‚Äôt even know you anymore

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father‚Äôs global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he‚Äôs truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can‚Äôt understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.

Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her Dad‚Äôs last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher for Lara, who - against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit - must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, ‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero. The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (‚ÄúEx Machina,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Danish Girl‚Äù) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (‚ÄúThe Wave‚Äù), with Oscar-winner Graham King (‚ÄúThe Departed‚Äù) producing under his GK Films banner. The film‚Äôs production began on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù also stars Dominic West (‚ÄúMoney Monster,‚Äù ‚Äú300‚Äù), Walton Goggins (‚ÄúThe Hateful Eight,‚Äù ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù) and Daniel Wu (AMC‚Äôs ‚ÄúInto the Badlands‚Äù).

Shooting on location in South Africa and the UK, Uthaug directs from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet. The director‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (‚ÄúMission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation‚Äù); production designer Gary Freeman (‚ÄúMaleficent‚Äù); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (‚ÄúSkyfall,‚Äù ‚ÄúGorillas in the Mist‚Äù); and costume designer Tim Wonsik (key costumer, ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy,‚Äù ‚ÄúCaptain America: The Winter Soldier‚Äù).
‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

This year, I'm making money (and GOLD)!  Specifically, I'm going through the history of money and recreating the various forms of currency as they evolved through history.  In this video, I explore both the origin of money and learn how to extract my own precious metal from the earth.

A list of modules used!

both channels went into the ALM O/A/X2 useful, because you could offset and invert the signals. for both channels!

for one channel (X AXIS) i used :-
Instruo troica (a great bank of 3 oscillators, i just fm‚Äôd them together to make different sorts of odd)
ALM Pamelas new workout for some more stuff ontop of those 3 oscillators talking to each other

for the other channel (Y AXIS) i used :-
Befaco VCO.. good to use the large range of octaves available on the octave switch
Happy Nerding FMAID this was really cool to make the waveform make more patterns!

Also at the end the weird 3d shape was a MOFFENZEEF MODULAR MUSKRAT, going into both channels!
the 3d look was me just adjusting the parameters on the muskrat!


Andrew duff suggested to look at the FONITRONIK CASCADE at thonk:-

along with a complex oscillator like the make noise DPO.

The exponential exhaustion of natural resources, declining productivity, slow growth, rising unemployment, and steep inequality, forces us to rethink our economic models. Where do we go from here? In this feature-length documentary, social and economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin lays out a road map to usher in a new economic system. 

A Third Industrial Revolution is unfolding with the convergence of three pivotal technologies: an ultra-fast 5G communication internet, a renewable energy internet, and a driverless mobility internet, all connected to the Internet of Things embedded across society and the environment. 

This 21st century smart digital infrastructure is giving rise to a radical new sharing economy that is transforming the way we manage, power and move economic life. But with climate change now ravaging the planet, it needs to happen fast. Change of this magnitude requires political will and a profound ideological shift.

// more thoughts on the iPhone X
I got the Silver iPhone X 256GB bc I wanted more space on my phone. I transferred from an iPhone 6S 64GB and used most of the storage space. I got the iPhone X because social media is my job and I feel it's worth to invest in the latest technology - if social media isn't your job, you could probably stick to getting the iPhone 8. The cameras are the same on the iPhone X and iPhone 8. Only difference are the new features like face detection and animojis, which are REALLY fun btw.

[LETRA]

Como el portazo que me quieres dar,
cualquier capa de pintura est√° de m√°s,
no te camufles en tu verdad,
a estas alturas no lo voy a tolerar.

Ganga, boca de hule,
no esperar√°s que ahora me calle y disimule,
lleg√≥ la hora de la verg√ºenza,
a ver si tienes el valor de hacer la cuenta.

Ahora que estamos los dos,
se apagaron los focos quemando el gui√≥n,
no mires de lado, sabes bien qu√© pas√≥,
puedes ahorrarte tu mejor actuaci√≥n.

Ahora estamos los dos,
sin futuro posible y al pie del ca√±√≥n,
hay balas que matan desde el interior,
errores que nunca perdona el dolor,
y no hay herida que sane sin decir adi√≥s.

Como una sombra entre mis miedos,
como una alerta que despierta tus enredos,
todo a destiempo, todo maldito,
te vi mentirme, mientras yo casi vomito.

Sentir la hora, romper tu gloria,
morderme el pu√±o en nombre de toda la historia,
enmudecerme como el domingo,
perder el tiempo lamentando si no grito.

Ahora que estamos los dos,
se apagaron los focos quemando el gui√≥n,
no mires de lado, sabes bien qu√© pas√≥,
puedes ahorrarte tu mejor actuaci√≥n.

Ahora estamos los dos,
sin futuro posible y al pie del ca√±√≥n,
hay balas que matan desde el interior,
errores que nunca perdona el dolor,
y no hay herida que sane sin decir adi√≥s.

Mala hierba, plata barata,
que yo tambi√©n s√© mentir por la ma√±ana,
no hay verso que no te rime
con el veneno y la manzana.

Collider.com's Editor-in-chief Steve Weintraub did some digging, and while he confirmed that Reeves and Gyllenhaal had a meeting, Reeves has also met with a few other actors as well. As you can see in the video above, Steve points out that Warner Bros. doesn't even have a shortlist of actors for The Batman. What this means is that nothing is set in stone, and while some may see this as confirmation that Affleck is on his way out, that would be jumping the gun.

The important thing to know right now with regards to casting on The Batman and future DCEU movies is that Warner Bros. is being very cautious. They previously put the cart before the horse years back when they announced a slew of DCEU movies and then those films didn‚Äôt come together. Now they‚Äôve pumped their brakes and you can see that in their slate. The only movies that have any momentum are the ones that are pretty much outside the bounds of Justice League.

Well, hello award show season! It‚Äôs nice to see you again. The stars came together tonight to wear black in support of the hashtag MeToo movement and gender equality in light of recent Hollywood sexual harassment allegations. Many also wore pins supporting the ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs Up‚Äù initiative to fight abuse in the workplace.

Emma Watson is first on our best dressed list wearing a high neck black peek-a-boo gown with a leg slit that showed off her gladiator heels. Emma paired the edgy black look with bright red lips and her recently cut short bangs. Many stars including Emma brought gender and racial justice activists as their plus ones to the event.

Following suit is Millie Bobby Brown who also wore black to the Golden Globes. Millie was fashionably late to the red carpet wearing this winged LBD with a deep V in the back. Millie looks mature beyond her years with winged eyeliner, diamond cuff earrings, and braided top knot. If you ask us, this look is an ELEVEN out of TEN!

And NO, your eyes are not deceiving you. Next on our list is Kendall Jenner who looks insanely gorgeous on her first ever Golden Globes red carpet. Kendall made her debut in a strapless black mullet gown with pointy stilettos.

Dove Cameron also stepped out for her very first Golden Globes, wearing a black Monique Lhuillier gown adorned with a gold bow at the waist. Dove completed her sophisticated look with diamond chandelier earrings and short glam hair.

Baby Driver star Ansel Elgort look dashing with slicked black hair and an all black suit complete with a black bowtie. But really, we expect nothing less from this guy!

Katherine Langford showed up to her first Golden Globes in a bejeweled Prada gown with a plunging neckline. Katherine‚Äôs mermaid hair looked like absolute perfection styled to one side to show off her diamond earrings.

Finally, Jessica Biel graced us with her beauty on the carpet wearing a strapless black and beige mesh princess gown with her hair in a slicked back glam updo.

But enough of our Best Dressed picks! Who do you think nailed their all-black look? Tell us your best dressed pick from this year‚Äôs Golden Globes.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx
