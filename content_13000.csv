On the wings of the Boeing 737NG's there are some curious black lines painted. They form boxes with some irregular shapes towards the back of the wings.
What are the purpose of those lines and can you really de-ice a Boeing 737 wing using Flower-spray cans?
These are some of the questions I will be coveing and explaining in todays video.
There are more videos coming up soon in my series about the Boeing 737 and its fantastic design so stay tuned!

One thing that I did not say in this video...that's just for you dear dedicated  dooblydoo reader...is that ""stressing out"" as we sometimes call it (focusing on the worry rather than the work) is a kind of flight. It is the easiest, most monkey-brain thing to do. There is nowhere to run, and we don't want the unpleasantness of engaging with the fight, so we flee into fear and it eats us because we literally have no defense against it.

If you'd like to learn more about stress and our physiological responses to it, here's a SciShow on how presistent stress harms our bodies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViWCk74Bu8k

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

But cyber crimes emanating from Russia and Russian speaking countries have been around for years, fueling attacks like a 2014 data breach of more than 500 million Yahoo! accounts and a scheme that stole 160 million credit cards from American corporations.

""If someone wants to hack you, they're gonna be able to"" former NSA hacker Patrick Wardle told VICE News. And if a Russian wants to hack you, they've certainly got the tools: A 2016 report by the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that 75 percent of all ransomware was created in Russia.

The apparent lack of ethical consideration in the buildup of Russian information technology and cyber security is rooted in decades of technical education under Stalin, who launched polytechnic schools to train engineers for his military-industrial complex. Russia's cyber capabilities can now be used for just about everything, ranging from digital bank robberies to tampering with critical infrastructure.

""This is the website of a big online store."" Kostya, an anonymous Russian hacker who agreed to show VICE News how easy it is to steal digital data. ""I can get into their configurations and download their client database.""

Spurred by the trillions of dollars online and in a generation raised on the web, hacking from Russia and around the world is flourishing.

VICE News went to Moscow to see the country‚Äôs expert hackers in action.

Will the insane duo survive a dab of ""Reaper Blood,"" or will this be the end of the road for Sean and Klaus? Find out in this explosive end-of-year Hot Ones special.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

which means this was just made because I love The Conjuring movie franchise. For some reason I like horror movies since I watched The Conjuring 2. No copyright infringement intended.

About the movie: 
When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate. Together they uncover the order's unholy secret. Risking not only their lives but their faith and their very souls, they confront a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun that first terrorized audiences in ""The Conjuring 2,"" as the abbey becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned.

Initial release: July 13, 2018 (USA)

Director: Corin Hardy

Film series: The Conjuring

Producers: James Wan, Peter Safran

Here's why that could be a big problem for anyone who pays a cable or wireless carrier bill. Following is a transcript of the video.

Steve Kovach: The FCC is getting ready to repeal net neutrality rules that were put in place in 2015. Net neutrality is the concept that all traffic on the internet should be treated the same. That means your internet provider can't suddenly decide to slow down YouTube or Netflix because they're not paying enough.

It also means they can't charge you more to access certain services. Everything has to be a level playing field. It means prices are stable and you get the content you want no matter who your internet provider is.

Without net neutrality rules, internet providers are free to charge you more for services they deliver over their pipes. It puts big players like Google and Amazon that can afford to have such services delivered at a huge advantage, and prevents the little guys from being able to afford to do the same.

So, you're probably wondering if net neutrality is so great and it's only been on the books for about 2 years, why does the FCC want to get rid of it all of a sudden? FCC chairman Ajit Pai, the Trump appointee who's running the FCC, put forth a proposal that will repeal the net neutrality rules.

Pai argues that by repealing these rules, the telecom companies will have to be transparent about their offering so if they decide to charge more for one service, it will be up to the customer to decide whether or not to buy it.

But it's easy to remain skeptical. When was the last time your cable provider or wireless carrier was transparent with you? There are tons of examples out there of internet providers and telecom companies abusing their power with content delivered over the internet.

Let's rewind back to 2014 when Comcast got caught slowing down the connection of Netflix streaming. Then there's AT&T which started a sponsored data program which meant apps could pay money to AT&T so they wouldn't suck up your data plan if you use them ‚Äî giving them an unfair advantage. That's hardly a level playing field.

The net neutrality rules put in place in 2015 largely addressed these problems to make sure all traffic would be treated equally. Now it's going away.

There's also a notion coming out from the FCC that repealing the rules will foster more competition. But that ignores the reality of internet connections here in the United States. Over half of US customers only have access to one broadband provider, and the vast majority only have two options. That's not competition. That's localized monopolies.

The bottom line here is the repeal of net neutrality is likely to commoditize the internet, meaning ISPs and carriers will be able to charge you more for the services they deliver over the internet. That's great news for the telecom companies and internet providers that have been charging you exorbitant amounts for your internet connections over the years, but it's bad news for you.

More than half of kids let their frustration out at least once a week, or more often. 
Why do they do it? 
By the time they turn 3 or 4, kids have much better language skills than babies, of course, but their vocabulary is still not advanced enough to describe everything they feel. So what can you do to prevent your kids from going crazy now and then?

SUMMARY
- If you are going out for a longer time, take their favorite blanket with you. It will give them the feeling of home and safety. When you are a parent, you tend to take plenty of stuff with you even when you leave the house for an hour. If someone is making fun of you, let them. 
- Start with little things, which will make him or her feel like they are in control. Control also means responsibility. They will of course not know it just now, but they will see how their choices affect what they do and how they feel. 
- don‚Äôta  get the message; they don‚Äôt get the answer. What do they do? Throw a tantrum. Dr. Hoecker offers the following solution: try to create a sign language your kid will understand and remember. Teach them to show basic words like ‚Äúfood,‚Äù ‚Äúmilk,‚Äù ‚Äúsleep‚Äù and so on. 
- Your child will unlikely be getting over a breakup or job loss, but they have their own concerns, as we know. When you feel danger is coming, the baby‚Äôs face is reddening, or they are giving other signs of a tantrum to follow, distract them. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go for a walk,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about we read your favorite book‚Äù are all great ways to divert your child‚Äôs fleeting attention. 
- Michele Borba, Ed.D., author of Parents Do Make a Difference, explains that kids really want to do what is right, but sometimes they just don‚Äôt know what that is. Explain your concerns and fears, never yell at or in front of your kid. You could even make up an ‚Äúangry vocabulary‚Äù for your child. That would be a list of words to express negative emotions. 
- Your kid doesn‚Äôt like to be forcefully interrupted, or feels uncomfortable about doing certain things? Give them warning before they have to do it and explain why it is necessary. 
- Millions of people in 47 countries around the world love Supernanny. This modern-day Mary Poppins gives great parenting advice. One of the things she suggests is using positive instead of the negative. Every time you feel like screaming  ""no,"" ""don‚Äôt"" and ""stop,"" don‚Äôt do it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt jump on the couch‚Äù could motivate your kid to do the opposite, especially if they are moody. 
- Introduce the new family rule to your kid. When he or she starts whining, you have the right not to respond to them. If that happens, keep your face straight. You made a deal, right? Jane Nelsen, Ed.D., coauthor of Positive Discipline for Preschoolers recommends that you also introduce a warning sign which will show you are going to stop listening. 
- We are not just talking about money here. Your baby will unlikely appreciate it, anyway. Thank the kids for doing something right. Doctor Michele Borba thinks it is a good idea to say things like ""Thanks for using your normal voice"" or ""My ears love that voice."" 
- All families are different and have different income. There is no universal answer for ‚Äúhow much pocket money to give your kid‚Äù in numbers. Rooster Money, a resourcefully focused on how you should go about pocket money for your child, offers an Allowance Report. It says four-year-olds get an average of $2.82. This amount is slowly growing and doubles by the time the kid turns 9.

If you haven‚Äôt seen The Greatest Showman, you need to see it because it was so good, and the music was incredible. Before this film hit the big screen, many of us had no clue who Keala Settle was, but once we heard her sing the powerful anthem ‚ÄòThis Is‚Äô Me‚Äô, we fell in love. Keala‚Äôs co-star introduced her to the eager audience where she performed the song with a full choir behind her. 
We can‚Äôt imagine the emotions that she must be feeling performing at the Oscars and at one point she definitely got emotional. 
The song didn‚Äôt win for Best Original Song, but she won on Twitter,
Her co-stars Zendaya and Zac Efron both showed love to her. Zendaya tweeted, ‚ÄúI have sang out, screamed out and done full choreo from the wings...I'm so proud of you @kealasettle YOU KILLED THAT!!!!!!!!!!‚Äù While Zac tweeted, ‚ÄúI have no words. @kealasettle you were glorious. #thisisme #oscars There were tons of other tweets talking about the moment when Viola Davis was shown dancing to the song and she was feeling it.
I would like to point out that Viola Davis was dancing so hard that her dress was falling off her right shoulder. That‚Äôs how you know the song is good. 
Anyway, now it‚Äôs time for you to chime in, what did you think of Keala‚Äôs performance and were you dancing like Viola? Let us know in the comment section below and then for more Oscar‚Äôs coverage click here now and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe. Thanks so much for hanging out with me here at Clevver, I‚Äôm your host Emile Ennis Jr. You can find me @emileennisjr and I‚Äôll see you next time.

1)    What movie can you think of that had an amazing opening scene but the rest of the film was terrible? 

2)    Do you agree with the fact that they should have done an Obi-Wan Movie before the Solo movie? Especially if they can get Ewan McGregor to reprise the role.

3)    With the recent description for Princess Shuri from Black Panther being that she is the smartest person in the world, do you think she will take over for Tony Stark as Iron Man if he dies in Infinity War or Avengers 4?

4)    You guys have become a daily addiction of mine and I love how everyone has and shares different point of views so constructively. With that aside, do you believe movie spending is out of control? Films seemingly need to make absurd amounts of movie to turn a profit or even be considered.

5)    I know in Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining, Danny is in his 40s. My top picks for the lead role of Danny are Michael Shannon, Michael Fassbender or Joaquin Phoenix. Who are your top picks?

Lyrics

I got a backlog of drama that won‚Äôt let me breathe
I got a catalogue of answers that you just won‚Äôt believe
I got a million other problems,  thinking  ‚ÄòOh my God‚Äô
The grapevine packs a punch, has a real mean streak,
I got an underlying demon that you don‚Äôt wanna meet
So if you‚Äôre trying to dig it up I think I‚Äôd rather not.

Cos I don‚Äôt care
What your preference is
To all the dirty references
Or if you should have known
No I don‚Äôt care 
What your best friend says
She‚Äôs a mess these days
So just leave that kid at home
Word on the street says I‚Äôm bad to the bone

I‚Äôm trying to paint a pretty picture in front of everyone
But it aint so fun
Cos with one mad rush
Yeah they‚Äôll take my brush
And make God damn sure that the colours run
This gossip storm is spiralling
These crooked tongues are bleeding out
No doubt

I don‚Äôt bite 
Too hard
But I‚Äôll send you some kind regards
As you turn your back
And take your sorry ass back home

Cos I don‚Äôt care, 
What your preference is
To all the dirty references
Or if you should have known
No I don‚Äôt care 
What your best friend says
She‚Äôs a mess these days
So just leave that kid at home
Word on the street says I‚Äôm bad to the bone

I never said I was as good as gold
My reputation‚Äôs in a stranglehold
My record aint the cleanest
And yours aint either
There‚Äôs nothing dodgy about me
It‚Äôs all conspiracy

Cos I don‚Äôt care, 
What your preference is
To all the dirty references
Or if you should have known
No I don‚Äôt care 
What your best friend says
She‚Äôs a mess these days
So just leave that kid at home
Word on the street says I‚Äôm bad to the bone

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy¬Æ Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Lyrics: 
I don‚Äôt know where I should begin
All this time that I‚Äôm putting in
Build me up just to bring me down
Cos you don‚Äôt want me to take the crown

I shouldn‚Äôt let you get to me but you do
I let you take it out on me yes its true
You‚Äôre saying sorry constantly
But you never, but you never
Never say a prayer for me
Never celebrate your hands on me
You better treat me like Church
You better treat me like Church

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm meant to do
All I know‚Äôs I believe in you
So praise me up for the things I‚Äôve done
I should feel like the only one

I shouldn‚Äôt let you get to me but you do
I let you take it out on me yes its true
You‚Äôre saying sorry constantly
But you never, but you never
Never say a prayer for me
Never celebrate your hands on me
You better treat me like Church
You better treat me like Church

I understand that Youtube is a business first, and will thus want to protect it's advertisers first, but I urge Youtube to *actually* listen to its creators to help find a happy medium where they can protect both their advertisers, and the people who shape this amazing community.  No more curated copy & pasted PR responses. No more gaslighting. No more secrecy. No more favoritism or special treatment. We don't need things our way, we just want open and honest communication about what it being done, when things go wrong, and how we can adapt our content to survive on this platform....(okay not gunna lie, working notifications would be nice, too).

We've made it: The Super Bowl. The final destination for teams eager to claim the greatest prize in football. All of the hard work and dedication of the teams playing has led to this. A final battle in Minneapolis.

This year, the two teams took different roads to get here. The New England Patriots, the usual suspects from the AFC, and the Philadelphia Eagles, the juggernaut hampered by injuries to key players. It's the perennial contender against an underdog in every sense of the word.

The Book of Henry is pretty close to an ideal awful movie. There's dimensions to watching the film that I can't convey fully in a condensed video, like how stop-start the plots are, how Henry gets sick and the movie basically stops what it was doing for twenty minutes waiting for him to die, and how watching the film is to go through a rolling process of trying to figure out what the film is trying to actually tell you. People who are familiar with Jurassic World should catch the similar ways that Book of Henry demonizes a woman for not behaving exactly and precisely as the mother figure that the filmmakers think she should be. Susan gets off light, though, since she isn't executed by dinosaur for the crime of texting.

About Bosch:
Based on Michael Connelly‚Äôs best-selling crime novels, the hit Amazon Prime streaming series BOSCH centers around the tenacious LAPD homicide detective, Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver). Passionately loyal to his own code (‚ÄúEverybody counts or nobody counts‚Äù), Bosch is a relentless cop who personalizes his cases and stops at nothing to bring justice to the victims of murder.

About Bosch Season 4: 
When an attorney is murdered on the eve of his civil rights trial against the LAPD, homicide Det. Harry Bosch is assigned to lead a Task Force to solve the crime before the city erupts in a riot. Bosch must pursue every lead, even if it turns the spotlight back on his own department. One murder intertwines with another, and Bosch must reconcile his past to find a justice that has long eluded him.

The lead single from the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack

Lyrics:
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don‚Äôt want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I‚Äôm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it‚Äôs not me (‚ÄôCause it's not me)
And what‚Äôs the point in hiding?
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn‚Äôt what it could be)
[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

It was Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals between the usual contenders for the 4th consecutive time since 2015, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors which was held in the Oracle Arena.

The game was tied in the 4th quarter at 107-107 as George Hill was shooting his 2nd free throw. Hill later missed his 2nd free throw, but JR Smith was at the right spot for the offensive rebound with 4.6 seconds remaining. Smith took the rebound, and almost ran to the other side of the court while LeBron was yelling at him.

JR Smith said he thought the Cavaliers were going to call a timeout when he grabbed the ball in the last few seconds of the fourth quarter, which is why he didn't take a critical and potentially game-winning shot with the score tied.

""It was a tie ballgame, and we had a timeout,"" Smith said. ""I tried to get enough space in between us, obviously, Kevin Durant was standing right there. I tried to get enough space to bring it out to maybe get a shot off. And then I looked over at LeBron, and he looked like he was trying to call a timeout. So I stopped. And then the game was over,"" Smith said.

This video features uncut raw video of what really happened right after JR Smith's mistake. LeBron James almost broke down into tears after asking coach Tyronn Lue if they were out of timeouts. LeBron James' 51 points weren't enough as Golden State Warriors survived in overtime with a 124-114 win over Cleveland. Stephen Curry finished the game with 29 points, followed by Kevin Durant's 26 points, and Klay Thompson's 24 points.

Make sure you have your ankle insurance, health insurance and life insurance before attempting this JR Smith's act!

‚óè LeBron James is 32 years old now, and he entered the NBA league back in 2003 with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and he had been playing at the Quicken Loans Arena for almost 11 years now. Sports Illustrated put him on the cover the prior year as a high school junior with the claimed tagline: ‚ÄúThe Chosen One.‚Äù Nike inked him to a seven-year, $90 million deal while he was still in high school. James has become the superstar icon in Cleveland itself, and the Cleveland Cavaliers has decided to place a new LeBron James banner outside of Quicken Loans Arena.

LeBron James has been one of the hottest names on the endorsement trail as well, locking up partnerships with Nike, Coca-Cola (Sprite), Beats By Dre, State Farm Insurance, Kia Motors, Intel, Progressive Insurance, Samsung, Verizon Wireless, McDonald's, Powerade, and Blaze Pizza.

James is on the Mount Rushmore of the most influential and popular active athletes on the planet. His 41 million Facebook followers is second behind only Cristiano Ronaldo among athletes. He sells more of his signature shoes for Nike than any other active athlete.

Back in 2016, LeBron James has reportedly donated an unprecedented $41 million to put 1,100 Ohio kids through college, which is part of his partnership with the University Of Akron, in which kids enrolled in his ""I Promise"" program will have the opportunity to receive a fully guaranteed four-year college scholarship. Through his ""I Promise"" program, students who are qualified will get a scholarship that will cover their entire college degree tuition and the general service fee from the university.

About Austin City Limits
Austin City Limits (ACL) offers viewers unparalleled access to featured acts in an intimate setting that provides a platform for artists to deliver inspired, memorable, full-length performances. The program is taped live before a concert audience from The Moody Theater in downtown Austin. ACL is the longest-running music series in American television history and remains the only TV series to ever be awarded the National Medal of Arts. Since its inception, the groundbreaking music series has become an institution that's helped secure Austin's reputation as the Live Music Capital of the World. The historic KLRU Studio 6A, home to 36 years of ACL concerts, has been designated an official Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Landmark. In 2011, ACL moved to the new venue ACL Live at The Moody Theater in downtown Austin. ACL received a rare institutional Peabody Award for excellence and outstanding achievement in 2012. ACL is produced by KLRU-TV and funding is provided in part by Dell, the Austin Convention Center Department, Shiner Beers and HomeAway.com. Additional funding is provided by the Friends of Austin City Limits.

Seeing who takes home an Oscar is exciting, but so is seeing the incredible dresses on the red carpet. We‚Äôve rounded up ten of the most gorgeous Academy Award dresses of all time. Lupita Nyong‚Äôo is known for her bold and creative fashion choices, but this pale blue dress of hers might just be our favorite.  Some actresses, like Brie Larson, have their gowns custom made for them, but Reese Witherspoon found the perfect dress in a vintage shop while visiting Paris.

1) Black Widow movie finally hits development with writer Jac Schaeffer

2) ‚ÄòAll the Money in the World‚Äô Reshoots Reveal Huge Pay Disparity between Wahlberg and Williams

3) Opening This Week 

4) John Williams Confirmed to Score ‚ÄòStar Wars: Episode IX‚Äô

5) Green Lantern Corps Movie Still in Development After DC Shake-Up According to David Goyer 

6) Mail Bag 

7) Live Twitter Questions 

A standalone Black Widow film has finally reached the development stages with Variety reporting that is a script is being penned by writer Jac Schaeffer. Sources for the trade say the movie is still very early in development, as the film has no greenlight.‚Äù But naming a writer is the closest the studio has come to moving forward on a standalone pic. The report also states Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige met with several potential candidates to write the film before choosing Schaeffer. No release date has been targeted at this time. 

Late last year, All the Money in the World made a mad scramble to do reshoots that would remove Kevin Spacey from the movie in order to replace him with Christopher Plummer. Now, according to USA Today, Mark Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million for his participation while co-star Michelle Williams only got an $80 per diem that added up to $1,000. 

OPENING THIS WEEK 

AGREE/DISAGREE

John Williams has scored 8 out of the 10 Star Wars movies that were released in theatres and now it‚Äôs officially official -  he‚Äôll return to finish out the Skywalker Saga. Variety reports via Film Music Reporter that he is set to score J.J. Abrams‚Äô Star Wars: Episode IX with Williams saying that he would very much like to complete the Saga he started, way back in 1977. 

It was just a year ago when we learned that Batman Begins and Man of Steel screenwriter David S. Goyer was hired on to write the script for DC and Warner Bros.‚Äô Green Lantern Corps alongside writer Justin Rhodes, but not much else has been revealed since.  Now Goyer is offering an update.

Kicking off our list is Pink and her incredible performance of ‚ÄòBeautiful Trauma.‚Äô Now, we all know Pink puts on a SHOW whenever she‚Äôs called on to perform and her performance at the AMAs was no different. In fact, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that Pink flawlessly singing ‚ÄòBeautiful Trauma‚Äô while casually hanging off the side of the JW Marriott Hotel is her greatest performance yet.
My hands were sweating throughout the entire performance.
As incredible as Pink was, how could we forget her co-AMAs opener Kelly Clarkson?! Kelly performed her newest hit ‚ÄòLove So Soft‚Äô and while she sounded amazing during it, the moment Kelly sang ‚ÄòMiss Independent,‚Äô I think was the official moment the balding began.
It felt like it was 2003 all over again and all was right in the world.
While everyone was getting lost in the moment during Kelly‚Äôs performance, Demi Lovato was literally living her best life. The cameras caught her singing along to Kelly and it was the cutest thing ever because she knew every word.
Speaking of cute moments, this next one goes to Niall Horan and Post Malone‚Äôs adorable bromance. When Niall went up on stage to accept his award for New Artist of the Year, he gave this ridiculously sweet shout out to his brotha from anotha motha.
So flippin cute. But enough fluff, we need to get down to business and talk about BTS‚Äô debut US award show performance! The guys performed their hit ‚ÄòDNA‚Äô and the crowd went wild. Literally. I think I saw grown men crying.
Now that‚Äôs how you do it. All other groups should be shook because that performance was fire. Cut to Ansel Elgort looking like a proud mom during their performance.
You can just feel him say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing great sweeties.‚Äù
Then there was the emotional moment when Linkin Park won the AMA for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist beating out Imagine Dragons and Twenty One Pilots, but Linkin Park made sure to thank their peers during their speech for speaking such kind words about Chester.
They then dedicated their AMA to Chester, his memory, his talent, sense of humor, and asked the audience to appreciate what we all have and to never take anything for granted.
Important words to live by for sure.
Then one of my dear queens Lady Gaga performed remotely from DC because she‚Äôs on tour, but live from LA or DC, she killed it per usual.
Later she won the AMA for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and she cried, I cried, we cried together because holy well deserved. That woman is already an icon and she‚Äôs barely in her 30s.
But speaking of icons. My nostalgia, heart, and edges weren‚Äôt ready for the Diana Ross medley for her Lifetime Achievement Award moment.
 Now we throw the word queen out there a lot these days, but literally Diana Ross is musical royalty. She is a legend and the fact that we‚Äôre getting to witness her perform a medley of a select few of her a millions of hits as she receives the Lifetime Achievement Award is truly historical. Can I also point out that she is seventy three years old! Seventy three! What the witch craftery is going on. She looks AMAZING.
And as if Diana gracing us with her presence wasn‚Äôt best moment worthy enough, then her beautiful family came up on the stage to celebrate her and her grandkids may be the cutest little gum drops I‚Äôve ever seen.
And speaking of their bomb family, can we  please all give a round of applause to Tracee Ellis Ross whoabsolutely killed it as this year‚Äôs host and I would love to see her come back to host a second time. You know whose hosted the show twice in the past? Her mama. Serious mother daughter goals.
Ok those were some of our favorite moments, but I want to hear which were yours so let me know in the comment section below and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I‚Äôm your host Drew Dorsey and I‚Äôll see you next time.

It may seem like the way we date is dictated by things like love and affection but it‚Äôs actually driven by something far less romantic: the economy.

Dating as we know it didn‚Äôt really start until the Industrial Revolution when young people left farms and small towns to flock to cities for work. They got jobs in factories, bars, and restaurants and being away from their families for the first time offered them the freedom to mix and match with other young people.

Ever since then the way single people have gotten together has been dictated by the ups and downs of the economy in the United States. We talk to Harvard‚Äôs Moira Weigel, author of ‚ÄúThe Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating‚Äù about how our woes about dating are nothing new, they‚Äôve been around since people starting pairing off.

The new ASUS ZenBook 13 UX331 is the lightest laptop from Asus with a high-performance discrete graphics chip. The Zenbook 13 UX331 is 13.9mm thin and 1.12kg light rocking a NanoEdge display which makes it more compact than most 13-inch laptops. A 4K 13.3-inch touchscreen display is available with a pixel density of 332 pixels per inch. Gaming is great with the NVIDIA GeForce MX150 chip and it‚Äôs own dedicated video memory. Up to 14 hours of battery life and fast charging that will get you 60% battery on a 50 minute charge.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a strange movie. The things it does well, it does very well, and the things it drops the ball on, it really drops the ball on. In this video I look at the character arcs of Finn and Kylo Ren, comparing what works and what doesn‚Äôt. And finally, I collect my thoughts on the idea of letting the past die.

Frank Pinello explores the Roman pizza scene, which is known for its two distinctive styles: pizza al taglio (rectangular and sold by weight), and pizza Romana tonda (round, thin and crisp). Whether you're grabbing a quick piece of al taglio at your local bakery or sitting down for a proper knife and fork pizza, there is no shortage of good pizza in Rome. From making pizza with Gabriele Bonci, the king of the al taglio style, to watching Stefano Callegari use ice cubes to create his iconic cacio e pepe pizza, Frank is in good pizza company.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GbKSa76tTxY/sddefault.jpg,0.0051770705518646674,0.0003242577996897442,15.965909090909092,0.0008917089491467967,0.005501328351554411,0.006393037300701208,2018-03-01,09:35:00,Thursday,3,8,37,8,32,41,329,1,76,0,1,7,16,3,0,4.0,8.0,"['ace', 'iy', '', 'pears)', '', 'rT a']","['ace', 'iy', 'pears)', 'rT', 'a']",True,"['ace', 'iy', 'pear', ')', 'rT', 'a']",6,6,13,1,0,0,1,6.200878718792994,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

How great was season 2 of The Crown? While last season the show had more facts they got wrong, in this video we take a look at the historical accuracy (and some inaccuracies) in the events of the second season of ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù. Warning: plenty of spoilers! The show got The Profumo Affair somewhat right. They got Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones half right. The Parker Divorce? Right-ish. The Billy Graham Timeline? Wrong!

*Note about this video*
I filmed this video last week. I had more footage about casey's 368 thang and John and I did a funny skit about it but it seemed inappropriate to leave the footage in  given the video casey posted today about the crazy trespasser. Don't mess with him guys lol. Ok I hope you enjoyed this video and please check out chris he is epic

It seems like we hear so much about the rest of the Kardashian family that Kendall Jenner is often overlooked. But considering all of the men she has been linked romantically to, it is surprising she even has time to do any modeling! We have rounded up twenty of Kendall‚Äôs alleged former and current flames, presented for your approval. Did Kendall really date Chris Brown, or was that just a publicity stunt? Many people suspect that she once dated Young Jinsu, but kept it a secret because of the scandal around their age difference. And all of her alleged romances haven‚Äôt been with men. People suspect she‚Äôs been intimately involved with fellow model Cara Delevingne, and personal assistant Lauren Perez. We know that she was linked with Justin Bieber, who was also connected to her older sister, Kourtney Kardashian, at one point. Yuck! Then there‚Äôs her on again off again relationship with heartthrob Harry Styles.

Today, we have the highlights from our first Live Show in Gangneung in which we learn the double luge position with Team GB athletes, and get them to try the spiciest tteokbokki(rice cakes) we could find in town! We were gonna go easy with them considering they were the Olympic athletes for Team GB, but they requested that they try something spicy! And they really went for it! If you‚Äôd like to watch more videos like this, stay tuned for our next Live Show coming up in every two days!!

Transcript:
Humanity's salvation began in a small Georgia town, where Joseph Seed heard a voice. ""Save as many as you can.  Whether they wish to be saved or not.""  Joseph preached the coming Collapse, recruiting misguided souls into the Project at Eden's Gate. As the cult grew, Joseph moved them to Hope County, Montana to settle New Eden, becoming known as ""The Father"".

In Montana, Joseph befriended local priest and Gulf War veteran, Jerome Jeffries, coercing his congregation to join the cult.

Joseph's siblings, the Heralds, then recruited the rest of Hope County.

John, a ruthless lawyer, secured land and converts using blackmail and coercion.

Faith, the pacifist, spread the Father's message of salvation.

Jacob, the military marksman, locked down the county with modern weaponry and upgraded aircraft.

When Jerome objected to their methods, the cult beat him and left him for dead.

You are the Deputy Sheriff dispatched to arrest Joseph Seed, but you'll find yourself surrounded by an army of cultists.  Navigate the Montana wilderness, recruit resistance fighters like Mary

May Fairgrave, whose father was driven to suicide by the cult.  Or crop-duster Nick Rye whose plane could come in handy.  Or a giant bear because video games.  Together you'll save Hope County in this ""work of entertainment"" definitely not inspired by today's politics.  But you‚Äôll probably just go fishing with Hurk instead.

Have fun!

It's a popular hangout place for locals and tourists where you can find a variety of stalls selling Indian food, Pan Asian food, and all sorts of desserts. 

Right after the stop for street food, we went to a Gomantak Restaurant that specializes in Malvani cuisine, which basically serves a lot of seafood. One of the must-try items was the Bombay Duck Fry (which isn't duck, but fish) as well as the Pomfret Masala.

Shawarmas are a very popular street snack in India, and I went a little crazy and went for a chocolate shawarma that a nearby restaurant stall sold. It was pretty interesting and a combination I have never thought of. 

Finally, we ended it all with some Kulfi! Kulfi is a very authentic type of Indian ice cream that is super creamy! The man who sells it has been at this location for over 23 years! What's crazy is that he gets up every morning, makes it for 5-6 hours, rides his bike for one hour (with this huge bin of kulfi ON the bike), sells it, rides his bike back, and repeats! His hard work really pays off, because this was probably the best kulfi I have had in India.

LYRICS:

VERSE 1:
God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light

CHORUS 1:
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star
A signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I


VERSE 2:
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

CHORUS 2:
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky 
A canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
 
BRIDGE:
If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I

If the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

VERSE 3:
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die
‚ÄÉ
CHORUS 3:
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I

I can see Your heart
Eight billion different ways
Every precious one
A child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

TAG:
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

Please excuse my bad editing with a non-professional tool.

After some rewatching, I found out that I missed a few scenes:
- In S01E07, right after her meeting with Elise Holden, Chrisjen learnt that Errinwright had ordered the assassination of James Holden. Her reaction was, ""Shit"".
- In S01E08, Souther was persuading Errinwright to stop the UNN board and search mission on Tycho station. Chrisjen shut Souther down with ""It's done. Moving on.""
- In S03E04, when aboard the Rocinante, Chrisjen called Sorrento-Gillis ""a fucking bobblehead"".

Nowadays, it isn't unusual for a big-screen blockbuster to run well over two hours, but even with lengthier run-times, filmmakers aren't completely free to include every scene they may envision for the final product. Scenes end up on the cutting room floor of every blockbuster ‚Äî and others are scrapped before they're even filmed.  While the theatrical film is often all the better for the cuts, it's always interesting to hear about what might have been. In the case of Black Panther, most fans certainly had no complaints regarding the theatrical cut, which had a 134-minute runtime.  Still, we might have gotten even more. Here are the Black Panther scenes you didn't see‚Ä¶

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday and Sunday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

Gh1iG5KH6Ug,MtJFuT0KFq4,HOW THEIR DADS FEEL ABOUT US MOVING TO CALIFORNIA,MAZELEE,22.0,2018-06-07 12:35:12+00:00,['mazelee'],584624.0,13405.0,330.0,-1.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gh1iG5KH6Ug/default.jpg,"[Alena] I've been preparing the girls for the move for months now by talking to them here and there about moving and listening for any concerns that they have. They are excited, but I know they are also nervous about what to except. They ask if we are going to visit back home to see their dad. Yes! I explained, in fact you can visit as much as you'd like. Over the years, we've developed a good relationship with the girls' fathers. For example, they have spent many Christmas day's and eve's at the other parents house and we just celebrate Christmas on some random other day. That was something I offered up to their dad's on my own, and it worked out great! But I couldn't do things like that until I got out of my own lead and let God be my guide. I knew not being married to their fathers that one day we may end up in different places, and I struggled with what their dads might say or think about it. I would be supportive if one of them moved away, I would try my best to have the girls visit and spend long summers as much as possible---so would they be supportive or hurt or upset?  Would they still be able to maintain a healthy, close relationship with their dads? But in our worries and doubt, God makes a way when we follow the path he has for us. I already trusted God that this decision to move was the right one, so why was I worried about what their dad's might say if this was what God wanted? In the midst of my own confusion, I'm reminded God has provided sooo much for us--the opportunity to homeschool in Cali (those who want to be homeschooled) to allow them more flexibility to visit family back on the East coast. Finances to fly them back to east coast and even more surprising, a supportive dad who was so happy about this opportunity that he said he'll come visit monthly! 

""When you put your faith in Christ, God commissions himself to protect, provide, and care for you. God always provides for his children, though often it is not in the way we expect or hope.The challenge is for us to see his provision and care, even when it is different than we expect. Because God is God, his ways are higher than our ways .""

Isaiah 55:8-9
‚ÄúFor my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    neither are your ways my ways,‚Äù
declares the Lord.
‚ÄúAs the heavens are higher than the earth,
    so are my ways higher than your ways
    and my thoughts than your thoughts.""

Welcome to another Soul Calibur video and today I want to talk about the 'Evil Kilik' form we saw In the most recent trailer!

Now courtesy of the beautiful people from the Soul Calibur reddit and the early access people got time with the game I was able to learn more about the new soul charge mechanic and how It visual alters character and their gameplay, which really is where this whole Evil Kilik thing steamed from!

Anyway I hope you enjoy this and learn more from It!

Is it ever ok to lighten black skin? Singer and former model Irene Major has been lightening her skin for 10 years, and doesn't see the problem with it. But AJ Odudu disagrees and says being black is not a choice and black women should be proud of their heritage.

Around the mid-2000‚Äôs, the LED traffic light began making its way onto the scene.  Recent developments in LED technology meant that energy efficient replacements for the standard incandescent lamp were beginning to appear.  Municipalities rejoiced with the energy savings they provided, but in cold climates they weren‚Äôt met with quite as warm a welcome.  Not producing sufficient heat to melt snow on their lenses, some drivers became confused by ambiguous signals and caused fatal accidents.
This video tells the tale of why this newfound ‚Äúproblem‚Äù generated harsh criticism to the new technology, and explains why this reaction is entirely dumb and regressive.

The film from Disney and Marvel stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Letitia Wright, Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong‚Äôo, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis.

This is very primitive technology and could be used to build an entire cabin with support from wattle and daub, a lattice pattern of small sticks. I will be incorporating more primitive technology into the other buildings on the property where I will build with stone, clay and wood to make a root cellar, cheese cave, bath house (sauna and shower), wood shed, workshop, maple syrup shack and more. I have found a source of free pallet wood and scrap wood within about 40 kilometres of the land that the cabin is on, so I may start gathering that when I'm in town so that I can build a small pallet wood cabin or shed to store wood and tools near the road. I have a shallow drilled well near the road where I park my truck, so I plan on building a wood shanty around the pump to keep it protected and so that it doesn't freeze as deeply in the winter. Basically it will be a pumphouse with storage room.
It is so cold outside that the rivers are freezing even where the current is strongest, and the shallow slow moving creek behind the cabin re-freezes after a few days of unseasonably warm weather. 
At night, I continue working inside the cabin by headlight, and since I'm off grid, I light the tiny house with lanterns and candles. The hot fire in the wood stove keeps the cabin at a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius, even during the coldest nights. 
For dinner, I make sourdough pizza dough and cook it on a cast iron frying pan on top of the stove. My wife made the whole-wheat sourdough bread and dough and the mozzarella cheese she made  from raw milk using traditional methods.

In Europe, there is high demand for the seeds contained in these cones, as it is believed that these seeds grow the perfect Christmas trees. But there is also a dark side to this Christmas story. Even the highest paid laborers only make 90 cents per pound of seed, while the lowest make 16 cents per pound. In addition, ‚Äúcone pirates‚Äù poach these valuable cones away from the company laborers.

It's a complex, and dangerous, process that allows people around the world to enjoy their holidays.

The 43-year-old rode down the¬†3312 metre piste with a spine-chilling 27% average gradient on a regular mountain bike that you could buy from the shops and put together, incorporating 15 millimetre (0.6 inch) metal spikes on the tyres for added grip.
After hitting a top speed of 167.6km/h in Chile‚Äôs Atacama desert to break the speed record for a standard mountain bike in December 2016, St√∂ckl followed in the footsteps of¬†Max Verstappen¬†and¬†Marc Marquez¬†by travelling to the most difficult alpine ski slope in the world.
Whereas F1 star Verstappen and¬†MotoGP¬†champion Marquez took their motorsport vehicles for a spin on the slope, St√∂ckl launched himself down it several times¬†- hitting top speeds of 106km/h.
He revealed: ""Racing down a straight icy hill is a totally different thing to anything else I have done. It definitely reached and exceeded my expectations. It was more fun than I thought it would be. Coming down the final shoot and jump was a great rush.""
St√∂ckl wanted to do something that nobody had ever done before ahead of the 78th running of the famous Hahnenkamm downhill ski race in his home country on Saturday January 20.

EXTREME DETAIL,BigStinkyMoose,24.0,2018-02-18 17:41:43+00:00,"['Alita Battle Angel', 'christoph waltz', 'james cameron', 'robert rodriguez', 'easter eggs', 'kishiro yukito', 'gally', 'trailer song', 'trailer', 'anime', 'gunnm', 'analysis', 'breakdown', 'rosa salazar', 'manga', 'movie', 'fight', 'Mahershala Ali']",139422.0,2400.0,231.0,584.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GlmvJ06CvkU/default.jpg,"Every Easter Egg in the Alita: Battle Angel Trailer

Do you like movies based on comic books? Kick ass women? Christoph Waltz? Learning about as many Easter eggs as you can before seeing a film so you can be that smart friend afterwards who fills your friends in on all the awesome stuff they missed? 

If so, have I ever go the perfect video for you. If not, what the fuck are you doing here? There are cat videos or something along the side, click one of those. Or, better still, check out the rest of my channel where I mercilessly mock shitty fight scenes. Then subscribe to make sure you don‚Äôt miss out on a single profanity laden rant. https://www.youtube.com/bigstinkymoose

In a departure from the norm, this video examines the Easter eggs left for fans of the manga, not its fight scenes. You could argue that it‚Äôs because I am a massive Alita: Battle Angel / Gunnm fan, and have been waiting for this movie since the day it was announced and I‚Äôll take any chance to rewatch the trailer a billion times and call it work. You might be right, but to paraphrase every parent when their child disagrees with them, ‚Äúmy channel, my rules.‚Äù

This video explores some of the details many other channels missed, such as the oddly shaped scar on the forehead of Christoph Waltz and the clues revealed in the reflections when we meet Mr. Vector (Mahershala Ali) all over the hauntingly eerie, nightmare inducing Alita: Battle Angel trailer song. 

In addition to discussing the presence of Christoph Waltz and the Alita: Battle Angel trailer song, the video also corrects a few errors that literally every other channel is getting wrong. For example, did you know that Alita is an android? No? Well that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs fucking not, IGN. When analyzing a movie trailer based off an existing work, it‚Äôs kind of important to get the central theme right. But hey, maybe that‚Äôs just me.

Knowing some basic information about the character is the best way to hype yourself up for what (I hope more than anything) is going to be an amazing film. It also means that you won‚Äôt sound like a complete moron when talking about the movie with your manga and comic book-loving friends, family, and audience, IGN.

LETRA:

[Intro: Maluma]
Alrighty right, baby

[Coro: Maluma]
T√∫ me partiste el coraz√≥n (Maluma, baby)
Pero mi amor no hay problema, no, no (Rudeboyz)
Ahora puedo regalar, un pedacito a cada nena
S√≥lo un pedacito

T√∫ me partiste el coraz√≥n (Ay mi coraz√≥n)
Pero mi amor no hay problema, no, no
Ahora puedo regalar (ya que, ya que), un pedacito a cada nena
S√≥lo un pedacito

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Ya no vengas m√°s con esos cuentos mami
Si desde el principio siempre estuve pa' ti
Nunca me avisaron cu√°l era el problema
Te gusta estar rodando por camas ajena
Ahora me toc√≥ a m√≠ cambiar el sistema
Andar con gatas nuevas, repartir el coraz√≥n
Sin tanta pena, ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay

[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
No tengo miedo de decir adi√≥s
Yo quiero repartir meu cora√ß√£o

Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
Ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay
(Maluma, baby)

[Coro: Nego do Borel, Maluma]
Voc√™ partiu meu cora√ß√£o (Ai, meu cora√ß√£o)
Mas meu amor, n√£o tem problema, n√£o, n√£o
Que agora vai sobrar ent√£o (O qu√™? O qu√™?)
Un pedacito a cada nena
S√≥lo un pedacito

[Puente: Nego do Borel]
Se eu n√£o guardo nem dinheiro
Quem dir√° guardar rancor
Voc√™ vacilou primeiro
Nosso caso acabou

[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
No tengo miedo de decir adi√≥s
Yo quiero repartir meu cora√ß√£o

Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
Ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay

[Coro: Maluma]
T√∫ me partiste el coraz√≥n (Ay mi coraz√≥n)
Pero mi amor no hay problema, no, no
Ahora puedo regalar (ya que, ya que), un pedacito a cada nena
S√≥lo un pedacito

[Outro: Maluma]
Tchau tchau
Eu n√£o sei falar muito bem portugu√™s
Mas quero aprender

Pretty boy, baby
Dirty boy, baby
Maluma, baby

T√∫ me partiste el coraz√≥n (Maluma, baby)
Pero mi amor no hay problema (Rudeboyz)
S√≥lo un pedacito
(Maluma, baby)

It is not the full list of the nominations and awards, won by Eric Marlon Bishop, known as Jamie Foxx. Brilliant comedian, actor and singer, he became the fan favorite.

Born in 1967, the Dreamgirls star was adopted and raised in a strict Baptist family. At the age of five, the future cinema icon started to play the piano during the ceremonies in the church. Early enough, Jamie‚Äôs talent of parody and joking became obvious to people around him. His teacher even invented a method of encouragement ‚Äì if the class had behaved themselves, they would have listened to Jamie telling jokes.

He first tried himself as a comedy performer in 1989. After this show Eric came up with a nickname ‚Äì Jamie Foxx, which brought him fame in a show business.

Today Jamie Foxx is not only an owner of numerous awards, but also a happy father of two girls. Let‚Äôs have a look at his girlfriends and daughters.

Connie Kline is a mother of Jamie‚Äôs elder daughter Corinne. Connie was in relationship with the famous actor for a short period in the 90s. Being an air force veteran, she became a mother of a pretty baby girl. Thus, Connie‚Äôs own personality always stayed in secret.
Kristin Grannis became a mother of actor‚Äôs second daughter Annalise. She used to work in a PR sphere. However, she is now financially supported by her famous ex-boyfriend.

ABOUT NIKA:
Daughter of two Slovenian faces in the entertainment industry Janja Pu≈°l and Zoran Kljun, owner of the largest dance school in Slovenia called Bolero, Nika was destined to stardom. Her passion for dance and love for the stage began at her parents' dance school, Bolero. There, she nurtured her talent and followed in her family's footsteps competing as an undefeated champion. Dancing professionally since the age of three, Nika trained in jazz, tap, latin, ballroom, funk, and ended up finding her deep love for hip-hop and the freedom it gave her to express herself as an artist. She wanted to share her passion for hip hop and became a mentor for the Bolero dancers, encouraging them to follow their dreams while bringing them to multiple wins from all over Europe.

After many wins, including taking gold (1st place) as a soloist at the at the world championships and being asked to be the global spokesperson for Nike, Nika was given the prestige title of Slovenian Ambassador of Dance. She took over Europe as a professional dancer and choreographer, and that sparked an even bigger dream. Nika wanted to grow and continue moving forward and proof that anything is possible.

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Hey Guys!

Last weekend I filmed my summer morning routine while I was in my hometown of Amsterdam! I've been wanting to share my morning's with you guys, but I've been traveling so much I haven't been able to give you guys a REAL inside look into what I do when I am not on the road. For this routine I made one of my favorite breakfast recipes and also did my typical morning skin care routine.

I spent a little time surfing the internet for nice summer destinations, but I want to go somewhere new! Last time I went on a vacation it was in the Philippines and I loved it (Yes I WILL BE COMING BACK SOON!). Let me know your favorite vacation spots, a place where I should go to recharge and eat new FOODS!

As always I hope you guys like the video! Give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe for upcoming videos! Should I do another Q&A?

This picks up a few years where the final season left off with Ben and Emma grown up. Mike and Phoebe have trouble with marriage, Monica and Chandler are getting a divorce, Joey couldn't find someone, and Ross and Rachel have trouble after many years of not being together! Filled with some surprise appearances by today's actors, along with some old friends (no pun intended), this movie will be an all-star extravaganza, while showing a lesson in being there for each other.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

It's the news we'd all been waiting for and over the weekend, the Friends cast finally revealed they are reuniting for an exclusive, untitled, unscripted special on HBO Max.

Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are officially BACK!

The main stars of ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù are going to appear on a reunion special, 16 years after the NBC show came to an end. The unscripted special was originally going to be available at the launch of HBO Max, a new streaming service, in 2020. But due to production being halted because of the coronavirus, the release date is reportedly unknown.

The friends will gather at the same Warner Bros. studio where they filmed the original series and reminisce about the show.

The actors confirmed the reunion in February 2020 by sharing a photo that was used for their 1995 Rolling Stone cover. The stars will also serve as executive producers and will receive at least $2.5 million each, according to Variety.

The reunion show will not be a new episode of Friends after all these years, nor will this be some kind of remake or reboot. Although the reunion will be shot at the same Warner Bros. soundstage that the series was, this will be an unscripted show, meaning it will probably be more retrospective than revival. The cast will lounge around the old set while clips play, most likely.

HBO Max will also be the exclusive streaming home for Friends.

Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six 20‚Äì30-something friends living in Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman, and David Crane.

KANYE WEST REVEALS SOME PRETTY SHOCKING REVELATIONS IN THIS RECENT TELL-ALL INTERVIEW

‚ÄúThis episode is brought to you by Secret Active. New Secret Active provides protection in the moments when it matters most.‚Äù 
HOST:  Looks Kanye‚Äôs breakdown was more of a breakthrough. 
It‚Äôs no secret that Kanye West is a polarizing figure. He‚Äôs one of the most famous people in the world, he‚Äôs married to the most famous Kardashian, has a somewhat tumultuous relationship with his ex-best friend Jay Z and his wife Beyonce and recently has been tweeting up a storm that has left many of his fans with mixed feelings. 

Kanye recently sat down with Charlamagne tha god for a 2 hour interview basically telling all! He opened up about everything we‚Äôve all wanted to know. Their interview was pretty long but don‚Äôt worry we got your back and are going to break down the highlights. 
The last we really head of Kanye in the news was when he had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized for it. Kanye even cancelled the rest of his Life Of Pablo tour because of it and touched on the fact that the breakdown really started back in 2016 after he interrupted Taylor Swift at the 2016 VMAs. Yay mentions that the aftermath of that event was what started it all. His songs weren‚Äôt being played on the radio after that and he admitted that that screwed with his head. 

Yay also talked about Jay-Z and Beyonce skipping his wedding and how that made him feel by saying QUOTE ‚ÄúI was hurt about them not coming to the wedding, I understand he was going through some things, but if it's family, you're not going to miss a wedding.""
Another point in the interview Kanye talks about the moment when Obama called him a jackass! Kanye said to that QUOTE‚Äù ""I just think that we were in a period where he had so much stuff to deal with, he couldn't deal with a wild card like me. I think that's too unpredictable. Someone that wasn't being controlled by strategy and thoughts, but someone who's acting on feelings.""
When asked about his breakdown Kanye said ""I think I'm in a stronger place than I ever was. After the breakdown‚Äîor I like to say, the breakthrough.""

""It was like all these things were, like, almost set up to put me on meds, to break me down. The robbery, you know, I don't know where that came from, was that a bigger plan, a bigger setup? Also, just being on stage four times a week, you know, you get exhausted up there

Yay also talked about when his wife Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris during his tour and how the robbers were planning to rob Kim after he left Paris.  He said quote ‚ÄúOne of the things she said that she heard was they were coming to rob her and they had to wait until I had left. The people had been strategizing and scheming on that for a long time. So when she probably got to Paris by herself, they were like 'This is our chance.' The next thing you know, I get off the flight the next day, and they were like, 'Oh, OK, we gotta like fall back.' And then when I left a couple days later ‚Äî I almost stayed ‚Äî I hear, my friend comes up to me and says 'Your wife was robbed.‚Äù 

 Yay also got candid about rejecting therapy, being in the hospital and his infamous return to twitter. He explains the reason behind his recent twitter rants by saying QUOTE ""The thoughts that I'm getting out on Twitter now‚Ä¶ I want to use this platform to share some of the breakthroughs I've had since going to the hospital.""
""I want to change the stigma of 'crazy' and the stigma of mental health, period ‚Ä¶ Best believe I'm going to take the stigma off of the word crazy.""

Day Stage Etapa 4. San Juan de Marcona.
The 330km special stage in Peru saw the field start in groups on a beach before heading into a demanding 100km stretch of sand dunes, taking competitors over 2000m above sea level for the first time on this year‚Äôs event, before finishing back in San Juan de Marcona.


The Dakar Rally (or simply ""The Dakar""; formerly known as the ""Paris‚ÄìDakar Rally"") is an annual rally raid organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation. Most events since the inception in 1978 were from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal, but due to security threats in Mauritania, which led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally, races since 2009 have been held in South America. The race is open to amateur and professional entries, amateurs typically making up about eighty percent of the participants.

The race is an off-road endurance event. The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are true off-road vehicles rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800‚Äì900 kilometres (500‚Äì560 mi) per day.

AN ECCENTRIC Frenchman lives with SEVEN lions and tigers right outside his front door ‚Äì and he looks after them on his own. For the last 27 years, 68-year-old Remy Demantes has owned a private rescue sanctuary for big cats, taking care of the injured animals and treating them as pets. Residing in Ouzouer-sur-Loire, France, Remy fell in love with exotics in 1986 when he saw the close bond his friend had with his domesticated panther ‚Äì inspired by their relationship, Remy decided to build upon his current property and make sure his home was at the centre of his animals. Fast-forward to 2018 and Remy could not imagine life without his beloved pets, spending hours each day hand-feeding them, taking them for walks and generally kissing and cuddling their furry coats.

We‚Äôve established by now that black holes are weird. The result of absolute gravitational collapse of a massive body: a point of hypothetical infinite density surrounded by an event horizon. At that horizon time is frozen and the fabric of space itself cascades inwards at the speed of light. Nothing can travel faster than light, and so nothing can escape from below the event horizon- not matter, not light, not even information.

Why Quantum Information is Never Destroyed

These ideas are pretty mind-blowing, but as crazy as black holes are, they‚Äôre also kind of ‚Ä¶ simple.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong; the math is complicated. But the objects themselves are simple. In fact every black hole in the universe, no matter how it formed or what happened to it afterwards, can be perfectly described with only three properties. Those properties are mass, angular momentum, and electric charge. Or at least this is the proposition behind the famous no-hair conjecture, or no-hair theorem.

[Verse 1]
Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunk on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here, get some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been off, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Interlude 1]
Oh, I get it, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well when's the last time you see a bad guy do the rap game like me?

[Verse 2]
I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many a' them coulda did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, ""She really is the best.""
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

[Interlude 2]
They need rappers like me, they need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards and make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been off, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Outro]
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle

There are ton of important duties that must be fulfilled, and they only get more essential the closer you get to the top.

But after that, Prince William is next in line, and that means that Kate Middleton could one day become Queen Catherine. We‚Äôll tell you about how her life would change should she someday become the new Queen. From completely adapting the way she conducts interviews, to dealing with boxes of paperwork.

In part 2 of our first day at Disneyland in California we start out in Tomorrowland with a ride on Hyperspace Mountain, a Star Wars overlay of the Space Mountain roller coaster. Then we head over to Main Street USA to try some more Pixar themed food with a fried bologna sandwich just like Carl from the movie UP would enjoyed! We got to ride It's a Small World and see some of the Disney characters they have added to the ride before finding a spot to watch the Pixar Play Parade. It was great to see the new additions Disney made to the parade as it moved from California Adventure over to Disneyland. I really liked the Kevin character! She was so cute! We rode a few more rides like the Matterhorn Bobsleds and Alice in Wonderland before grabbing a spot on Main Street to watch the Together Forever fireworks. It truly was a magical trip to Disneyland and we can't wait to show you our day at DCA as well! Tune in tomorrow for another new video!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches.

Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976)[1] is an American country singer-songwriter and television personality. In 2001, he made his debut with the single ""Austin"". The lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, ""Austin"" spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (""All Over Me"" and ""Ol' Red"").[1] Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, he was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.

It may seem like everyone is a fan of Meghan Markle, but of course there have to be some dissenters. We‚Äôll let you know which celebrities weren‚Äôt celebrating the latest royal wedding between Meghan and Prince Harry. Some sources report that Meghan is even embroiled in a feud with her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton. Meanwhile, Princess Eugenie had to push back her own wedding to accommodate Meghan, and reportedly isn‚Äôt happy about it. Some people hate her because they feel like she‚Äôs fake, and people like Wendy Williams have been quick to call her out on it. English actor Daniel Radcliffe dislikes the royal family in general, especially Meghan‚Äôs husband, Prince Harry. Do you think these stars have legitimate reasons to dislike the newest Duchess, or are they just jealous of her? Let us know what you think in the comment section and then subscribe for more from TheTalko.

Transcript from man predicting the future:
Hello ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to the program. Today we are going to talk about a rather serious topic. The future. What does the future hold? Today we are going to make some predictions. Maybe someday, man will look back on such predictions. The year, as you know, is 1945. 100 years from now, it will be 2045. It is difficult to imagine the state of the world in 100 years. As we have seen before, the world has changed drastically in the past 100 years. Just 100 years ago, in the year 1845, the concept of self-powered flying machines seemed as ridiculous an idea as ever to many. Through this great industrial revolution, the world has seen more change than ever before. Keep this in mind, as we go over our predictions for the next 100 years. In 100 years, I predict that man will have stepped foot on other celestial bodies, such as the moon and the planet Mars. In 100 years, I predict that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety of sources. Big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy. I predict that in 100 years, cars will no longer be constrained to the ground. They will have the ability to fly in the air at will. And the energy that powers the cars will come from the sun. In 100 years, I predict that television sets will get increasingly smaller. I predict television sets will shrink to the point in which they can fit on our wristwatches. I think that in 100 years, there will be film cameras at every street corner. They will be put in place in the name of safety, but our freedoms will increasingly vanish.

Lyrics: 
you wanted a friend 
i wanted you back 
i knew it would end 
our contract was bad 
i knew you would go for those 
obvious, obvious people 


you knew it was wrong 
to hold me close 
you wrestled my fears
without letting me go
but i knew you would fall 
for those obvious, obvious people
 
(CLICK)

I bet your out in his car right now 
lips and hands no longer searching for me 
lust is a need
love is a dream 

and i could follow you right down 
from the desert sands to the light house
where the morning crushes your eyes down
look at me
pull me close 
saturate
come undone
overdose

but he's in love with your soft talk
wrote your name in the side walk
you and him in the parking lot
Friday night 
getting close
let it go 
live your life/lie

you wanted to leave i couldn't agree
to follow you back 
was to give up on me 
i spent my whole live running from 
obvious obvious people 

you spent more than a year trying to forget my past 
I laughed at your tears 
your much better than that 
but I'm blaming us both
we're just obvious obvious people 


i know your out in his car right now 
lips and hands no longer searching for me 
lust is a need
love is a dream

i bet you think I'm in love again
with another one of those blonde girls 
i call friends 
but your the one who can't live alone 
you couldn't wait until i came home

and i could follow you right down 
from the desert sands to the light house
where the morning crushes your eyes down
look at me
pull me close 
saturate
come undone
overdose

but he's in love with your soft talk
wrote your name in the side walk
you and him in the parking lot
Friday night 
getting close
let it go 
live your life/lie",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GxC05dJ8TqQ/sddefault.jpg,0.014898397811645175,0.00014654161781946072,101.66666666666669,0.001611957796014068,0.015044939429464634,0.016656897225478702,2018-04-27,04:03:09,Friday,4,8,73,8,44,48,441,3,77,1,0,6,8,0,13,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.490097721491197,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

In today's episode we're discussing the Est archetype! This is another hotly debated archetype with many potential units throughout the series. But some fans believe this archetype may not exist at all, or that others have been too quick to call many characters Ests! Est was a Pegasus knight sister from the very first Fire Emblem game (Dark Dragon and the Sword of Light) who joined the player very late into the player's journey at a really low level, with the player even having recruited her sisters Catria and Palla and given the opportunity to use them quite way earlier on. This trend continued throughout the series, with Ests being units that join you very late in the game but typically have above average or even potentially great growth rates, providing a unique opportunity to give the player a unit with amazing potential... just a bit last minute. Without many chapters left in the game to use them in and with their horribly low starting levels and base stats, are they even worth it? And with their sort of duality with the Jagen archtype; who's objectively better, Jagens or Ests? Let's find out. Thanks for watching, guys! (€∂‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó‚Ä¢ÃÅ)€∂

About INCREDIBLES 2:
In ‚ÄúIncredibles 2,‚Äù Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack‚Äîwhose super powers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don‚Äôt shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That‚Äôs what makes this family so Incredible. 

Written and directed by Brad Bird (‚ÄúIron Giant,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Incredibles,‚Äù ‚ÄúRatatouille‚Äù) and produced by John Walker (‚ÄúThe Incredibles,‚Äù ‚ÄúTomorrowland‚Äù) and Nicole Grindle (‚ÄúSanjay‚Äôs Super Team‚Äù short, ‚ÄúToy Story 3‚Äù associate producer), Disney‚Ä¢Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúIncredibles 2‚Äù busts into cinemas on July 13, 2018.

Getting the opportunity to reimagine the Pok√©mon theme and sing it alongside Jason Paige was super cool. We recorded this all independently in our own studios and shot it with the help of my independent production company, Villainous Media in San Diego CA. Power to the artists & fans who make it possible for people to create stuff like this.

GyVSj3KNGCQ,ESyJop31cmY,The Most Popular Word in the World,vlogbrothers,22.0,2018-03-16 16:09:49+00:00,"['language', 'etymology', 'education', 'history', 'learning', 'english', 'world', 'Martin Van Buren', 'politics', 'America', 'american history', 'west africa']",263841.0,14337.0,87.0,1306.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GyVSj3KNGCQ/default.jpg,"There is literally an entire book about these two letters: http://amzn.to/2GyJyla

Is OK the most popular word in the world? That depends on how you look at it. It's been argued that it's the most /spoken/ word in the world, but I have to call BS on that. The most spoken word has got to be ""the"" or ""I"" or the equivalent in Mandarin.

But Popular is a more subjective measure...and one that I'm choosing because I think that ""OK""s adoption as a loanword is so extremely common. Now, there may be words that have been adopted into more languages...I'm thinking of ""taxi."" But ""OK"" is adopted for everyday conversational use, whereas ""taxi"" is only for specific situations. So that's the completely subjective argument I'm using to say that ""OK"" is the most popular world in the world.

So, something that didn't fit into the video...we think of memes as these new-fangled things, and definitely the way they spread now (and the speed at which they spread) is different, but acronyms from comical mis-spellings indicate that memes have been around for a long time, we just didn't call them memes. And the fact that the Democratic Party latched onto one to try and promote a candidate that had a less-than-american-sounding feels much more 2018 than 1838 to me. Van Buren was actually the first president who wasn't of British ancestry (or British himself) which was a big deal at the time.

Another thing I didn't get into the video...the creation of OK a little bit depended on our society becoming more text-based and literate. Telegrams helped this, but newspapers did as well. The extent to which these technologies revolutionized our society and our ability to communicate fast and wide is really hard to understand now, but is maybe the kind of thing we should be thinking about as our own world is being revolutionized by new communication technologies. We don't know, ultimately, what the affect will be. But they will be long-ranging and maybe invisible, just as OK has been for the last 175 years.

LYRICS

Ok it‚Äôs friday night
I got my weekend planned
I got a new outfit
I called up all my friends
We bout to go all out
Tonight‚Äôs gon feel like heaven
The boys all drive big trucks
They‚Äôll should roll up at seven

I‚Äôm gonna be

Stepping out in my new fit
With the people I‚Äôm cool with
Ok, almost finished
Just need two more minutes
Tonight we‚Äôre gonna stay up
Almost done with my makeup
Ok, yes I‚Äôm finished
Just need two more minutes

Tell the boys they can get out the chevy
Ok almost finished
Just need 2 more minutes
Takes some time for us to go get ready
Ok yes I‚Äôm finished
Just need 2 more minutes

They say good things take time
I say they‚Äôre slow and steady
They‚Äôre just a few behind
We‚Äôll go help them get ready
Don‚Äôt like the way that looks
Not sure this fit will hit
We think you both look great
I think that we should switch

I‚Äôm gonna be

Stepping out in my new fit
With the people I‚Äôm cool with
Ok, almost finished
Just need two more minutes
Tonight we‚Äôre gonna stay up
Almost done with my makeup
Ok, yes I‚Äôm finished
Just need two more minutes

Tell the boys they can get out the chevy
Ok almost finished
Just need 2 more minutes
Takes some time for us to go get ready
Ok yes I‚Äôm finished
Just need 2 more minutes

Olivia:  Bye guys, hope you have fun tonight
Madison:  Thanks Olivia‚Ä¶ But don‚Äôt wait up for us.
Olivia:  Ugh!  How rude!
Sierra:  Are you sure you remembered everything?
Madison:  Yes sierra, we‚Äôve got it covered
Gracie:  Oh wait, I forgot one thing‚Ä¶  Just give me like two more minutes!

I‚Äôm gonna be

Stepping out in my new fit
With the people I‚Äôm cool with
Ok, almost finished
Just need two more minutes
Tonight we‚Äôre gonna stay up
Almost done with my makeup
Ok, yes I‚Äôm finished
Just need two more minutes

Tell the boys they can get out the chevy
Ok almost finished
Just need 2 more minutes
Takes some time for us to go get ready
Ok yes I‚Äôm finished
Just need 2 more minutes

Alright guys, I‚Äôm ready!

""Why did you reupload?"" - The original had some flickering to it and a fan cleaned it up for me. Reuploading oftentimes hurts a video and channel more than it helps. But sometimes you got to take the hit, not for money or subs. But to leave behind something you're proud of. Included is 2 minutes of extra footage if you're willing to help this version get some exposure. Thanks everyone!

Full Lyrics:
Fire is burning
Casting a shadow
People are watching
Waiting for the fall

Whispers are creeping
Under the gallows
People are talking
We could lose it all

Tell them something is coming
There's blood in the water
Give them a warning
Let it all come crashing down
Burn the castle to the ground
Hang the lies, no disguise
It's our time
Let it all come
Down down, down

Pointing our arrows
Fighting for glory
Heat in the narrow
We could lose it all

Let it all come crashing down
Burn the castle to the ground
Hang the lies, no disguise
It's our time
Let it all come down

Burn the castle to the ground
All the cries, alibis
It's our time
Let it all come down down
Down down
Down, down

Let it all come crashing down
Burn the castle to the ground
Hang the lies, no disguise
It's our time
Let it all come down
Burn the castle to the ground
All the cries, alibis
It's our time
Let it all come down
Down, down",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H0ipgUHWgkU/sddefault.jpg,0.012058761223832723,0.0001812485039350809,66.53164556962025,0.0010331929485919592,0.012240009727767806,0.013273202676359765,2018-06-11,21:39:25,Monday,0,12,21,12,18,73,167,2,25,0,2,10,19,1,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.470924834943363,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

When the Teen Titans go to the big screen, they go big!  ‚ÄúTeen Titans GO! to the Movies‚Äù finds our egocentric, wildly satirical Super Heroes in their first feature film extravaganza‚Äîa fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the super hero genre, complete with musical numbers.

It seems to the Teens that all the major super heroes out there are starring in their own movies‚Äîeveryone but the Teen Titans, that is!  But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick.  If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them.  With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.  But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously Super-Villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry.  The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line!

Will Arnett (‚ÄúThe LEGO¬Æ Batman Movie‚Äù) and Kristen Bell (‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù) lend their voices to the first-ever big-screen version of DC Entertainment and Cartoon Network‚Äôs animated TV show, which also stars Greg Cipes (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles‚Äù) as Beast Boy, Scott Menville (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù) as Robin, Khary Payton (‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù) as Cyborg, Tara Strong (the ‚ÄúMy Little Pony‚Äù franchise) as Raven, and Hynden Walch (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúAdventure Time with Finn & Jake‚Äù) as Starfire, reprising their roles from the series.

The film is being directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath, based on characters from DC.  Michail, Will Arnett and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers.  Apart from Arnett, all are ‚ÄúTeen Titans GO!‚Äù series contributors.

Set to release on July 27, 2018, ‚ÄúTeen Titans GO! to the Movies‚Äù will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1tCYvFaq6A/sddefault.jpg,0.011217990313387357,0.0061566573399710325,1.822091062394604,0.0,0.017374647653358388,0.017374647653358388,2018-03-24,15:00:31,Saturday,5,9,15,9,15,39,113,2,25,2,0,6,0,2,0,3.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.327422292887759,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

While some celebrities are open books about their personal lives, others tend to keep the details of their relationships on the down low. But even those A-listers who don't mind having their real-life love stories play out in headlines sometimes slip a few details past the public. For example, there are a lot of celebs who've had same-sex relationships that most people didn't even know about over the years. When it comes to these stars, they weren't exactly hiding anything, but their various dalliances did seem to slip under the radar for a lot of fans.

Really we should have guessed that these devious bosses from games including Bloodborne, Paper Mario and Tony Hawk's Underground would throw the rulebook out of the window in order to gain an edge over us, the valiant hero. 

And yet it makes for no less of a surprise when the tried and tested techniques we'd been using for the rest of the game suddenly fail us in the face of a cheaty boss that cheats, the cheating cheater.

VERSE 1:
Be still and know
That the Lord is in control
Be still my soul
Stand and watch as giants fall

CHORUS:
I won‚Äôt be afraid You are here
You silence all my fear
I won‚Äôt be afraid
You don‚Äôt let go
Be still my heart and know
I won‚Äôt be afraid

VERSE 2:
Be still and trust
What the Lord has said is done
Find rest don‚Äôt strive
Watch as faith and grace align

BRIDGE:
Surely love and mercy
Your peace and kindness
Will follow me
Will follow me

POST CHORUS:
Your love surrounds me
Your love surrounds me here

He‚Äôs well known for studying and treating addiction.

I‚Äôve wanted to invite Dr. Mat√© to this podcast for a while because he is not only an expert in the pathologies of addiction, but he‚Äôs experimented with ‚Äî and used successfully ‚Äî tools that are perhaps outside the realm of traditional psychiatry. He is also a co-founder, along with Vicky Dulai, of Compassion for Addiction, a group that advocates for a new way to understand and treat addiction.

Justin Choi - Hey John. I loved The Lego Batman movie and got excited when I heard Adam McKay was going to direct the Nightwing movie. Haven‚Äôt heard anything about it in ages and today I hear he‚Äôs in talks to direct Dungeons & Dragons. So I guess 2 questions. 1) Into the idea of a D&D movie? 2) What is going on at DC?

Hi John, I watch your show everyday and I'm a big fan. A report surfaced from Variety, that Jessica Chastain is in talks to play the adult Beverly in It: Chapter 2. My question is, with Chastain looking likely to play Beverly, do you think other actors at her calibre will end up in talks to play the adult Losers Club?

James Lane - Been a fan since The Movie Blog days. You've talked a few times about Movie Pass, and I see now that it's $7.95 a month. However, when I try to sign up it tells me it's billed annually. What gives? Has it always been an annual payment, or will they go back to monthly billing soon? I wanted 2 cards, but not paying that much all at once.

Learn Shuriken Jutsu with Ninja Stars and Other Japanese Shuriken:

Shuriken, are commonly known in the west as throwing stars, or, ninja stars. However, those terms hardly do justice to this class of traditional ancient weapons because the pointed ‚Äústar‚Äù shaped form is only one of many different shuriken designs developed over the centuries. Shuriken (which means, ‚Äúhand hidden blade‚Äù) is a traditional Japanese concealed weapon that was used for throwing, and sometimes stabbing, or poisoning. They are small, sharpened, hand-held blades and were traditionally made from a variety of every day items, such as needles, nails, and knives, as well as coins, washers, and other flat plates of metal. Shuriken objects were mainly a supplemental self-defense tool in the Japanese warrior‚Äôs arsenal, though they often played a pivotal tactical role in battle and were used for centuries in various countries. The art of wielding the shuriken in Japan is known as, shurken-jutsu, and was mainly taught as a secret part of the martial arts training curriculum of many famous Japanese martial art schools and clans.

These stainless steel ninja throwing stars are of the highest quality and can be used for combat training and target practice in modern study of traditional samurai and ninja historical objects. They were mainly used as distractions in real self defense scenarios and should not be relied upon for self defense in modern situations of danger.

Bad Wolves - Zombie (Lyrics):

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eighteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their guns, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eight-teen
In your head, in your head, they're dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie,

Oh oh oh oh
Ie-ie, oh

A few years ago I made a documentary about uranium, radioactivity and radiation. I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television‚Äôs most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in ‚ÄúEmpire: The Movie,‚Äù Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important ‚Äì Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

You find the description below. I hope you enjoy them as I did. Tell me in the comments which one is your #1 - or at least your #1.5 - I will include your vote in the ranking at the end of this text to see which commercial people like the most.

These ads are included:

1. Cinesite Studios, ‚ÄúBeans‚Äù, also called ‚ÄúNot for Austronauts‚Äù or the ""Astronaut Ad"" from 2013, a mock ad ‚Äì the non-existent Haynes Baked Beans only resemble Heinz ‚Äì for the famous visual effects and feature animation studio known for movies like Harry Potter, Avengers: Infinity War, Captain America: Civil War, and others whose logo appears at the end. This hillarious commercial is often shown but not always understood. It won Gold for Best Web Viral at the AEAF awards. By the way, the music is Sons of War by Two Steps from Hell.

2. Doritos, ""Ultrasound""/‚ÄúBirth‚Äù from the 2016 Super Bowl was a highly controversial, yet extremely funny commercial that still has its fans and opponents

3. Kia niro, ‚ÄúHero‚Äù with Melissa McCarthy from the 2017 Super Bowl, also refered to as ‚ÄúI love Whales!‚Äù that got a lot of press and features Bonnie Tyler's ‚ÄúHolding up for a hero‚Äù

4. Kia, ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù with Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus from The Matrix, singing Nessun dorma for the Super Bowl 2014

5. Shadow of War, ‚ÄúNot today, Brian‚Äù from 2017 for the video game, also known for its line ‚ÄúNothing will be forgotten‚Äù

6. Heinz Tomato Ketchup, ‚ÄúWiener Stampede‚Äù, the adorable ad from the 2016 Super Bowl, part of the ‚ÄúMeet the Ketchups‚Äù promotion

7. Volkswagen VW Passat, ‚ÄúThe Force‚Äù, also called ""Darth Vader"" from 2011 Super Bowl - this  extended version was seen by 8 million viewers online before the game, a huge success at this time, during the game a shorter version was aired, later other versions/sequels followed, a game-changing commercial a lot of media was talking about and many people still enjoy.

8. Clash Of Clans, ‚ÄúRevenge‚Äù with Liam Neeson as his famous character from Taken for the Super Bowl 2015, also famous for its line ‚ÄúYou will regret the day you crossed AngryNeeson52‚Äù

9. Old Spice, ‚ÄúJungle Wilderness‚Äù from the 2011 Danger Zone campaign by Wieden + Kennedy Portland with Neal Bledsoe and the famous line ‚ÄúYou smell like you look ‚Äì amazing‚Äù (the most amazing thing, though, is the line ‚ÄúDramatization only. Do not attempt.‚Äù in the bottom right corner at 7:21 - who would attempt THAT?) 

10. Wix, ""Disruptive World"" with Gal Gadot, the new Wonder Woman and Jason Statham from The Expandables and Transporter for the cloud-based web development platform for the Super Bowl 2017 in the extended version - with more than 22.6 million views online it was the most-seen commercial before the game. It was was shot by the French Louis Leterrier who directed the Transporter films, Unleashed, The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans and Now You See Me in Barcelona with estimated costs for producing and broadcasting somewhere around 14 millions dollars

+

11. Anheuser-Busch Budweiser beer / Bud, ‚ÄúWhassup?‚Äù, also known as Wazzup, What‚Äôs up or True, true that ran from 1999 to 2002 and became a catchphrase. It won the Cannes Grand Prix and the Grand Clio awards, and was parodied in Scary Movie in 2000, years later also by Annoying Orange and others.

11.5 Anheuser-Busch Budweiser beer / ‚ÄúWassup Wasabi or just ""Wasabi"", the lesser known yet extremely funny follow-up to the Whassup commercial with Dookie and his wife

-----------------------------------------------------------


The votes are in and the current winner is: Bud ‚ÄúWhassup‚Äù ‚Äì true, true ‚Ä¶

CATS WITH ATTITUDES!

Sparta - from viral hit ""The Mean Kitty Song"" which now has over 80 million views to date.  He's a Bengal mix, born sometime in mid-2007; I celebrate his b-day on May 20th.  He rescued me in July of 2007.  Sparta love stalking, wrestling, crunchy toys, playing fetch and being held like a baby.

Loki - the long white kitty that looks like a cow but I believe he may be part monkey. Loki is about the same age as Sparta, so we celebrate their birthdays together. He found me at a rescue center in July of 2008. He loves toys, making noise, hanging upside down, poking things and more than anything, he loves the love!

Justice League features TWO end credits scenes! The first shows The Flash (Ezra Miller) and the resurrected Superman (Henry Cavill) racing in the fastest man alive contest. The second shows Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), having escaped from Arkham Asylum, meeting with DEATHSTROKE (Joe Manganiello) on a yacht. Sam Bashor explains what goes down in these scenes, and what they mean for the future of the DCEU. Who is Deathstroke, and what is the ""league"" Lex refers to? Is Flash faster than Superman?

 About Rainbow Six Siege:
 Rainbow Six Siege is the upcoming installment of the acclaimed first-person shooter franchise developed by the renowned Ubisoft Montreal studio for the new generation of consoles and PC.

 Inspired by the reality of counter terrorist operatives across the world, Rainbow Six Siege invites players to master the art of destruction. Intense close quarters confrontations, high lethality, tactics, team play, and tension are at the center of the experience.

 The multiplayer gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege sets the new bar for intense firefights and expert strategy in the rich legacy of past Rainbow Six Games.

 THE SIEGE GAMEPLAY
 For the first time in Rainbow Six, players witl engage in sieges, a brand-new style of assault. Enemies now have the means to transform their environments into strongholds: they can trap, fortify, and create defensive systems to prevent breach by Rainbow teams.

 To face this challenge, players have a level of freedom unrivaled by any previous Rainbow Six game. Combining tactical maps, observation drones, and a new rappel system, Rainbow teams have more options than ever before to plan, attacks, and diffuse these situations.

 COUNTER TERRORIST UNITS
 Counter terrorist operatives are trained to handle extreme situations, such as hostage rescue, with surgical precision. As ‚Äúshort range‚Äù specialists, their training is concentrated on indoor environments. Operating in tight formations, they are experts of close quarter combat, demolitions, and coordinated assaults. Rainbow Six Siege will include operators coming from five of the most worldwide renowned CTU: the British SAS, the American SWAT, the French GIGN, the German GSG9 and Russian SPETSNAZ.

 These Operators are specialists with their own expertise within Siege operations. Each has their own unique personality & specialty. Some are focused on assault whereas others are defense-oriented. They can be combined within the same team to create new team strategies.

 PROCEDURAL DESTRUCTION
 Destruction is at the heart of the siege gameplay. Players now have the unprecedented ability to destroy environments. Walls can be shattered, opening new lines of fire, and ceiling and floors can be breached, creating new access points. Everything in the environment reacts realistically, dynamically, and uniquely based on the size and caliber of bullets you are using or the amount of explosives you have set. In Rainbow Six Siege, destruction is meaningful and mastering it is often the key to victory.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

2018 is undoubtedly going to be the most exciting year yet when it comes to comic book movies - seriously, it's going to be absolutely awesome! We're going to see Ant-Man and the Wasp, Aquaman, Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Deadpool 2 and X-Men: Dark Phoenix being released - as well as Venom, which is a very exciting prospect. Ruben Fleischer will be directing and Tom Hardy will be playing the lead role in Sony's intriguing offering - and, quite frankly, we're extremely excited about it. We actually know very little about it at this stage, and this video will look at five rumors about it, as well as five things we DO definitely know about it. Those things are; that it will actually be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (rumor), that Tom Hardy is totally nailing his portrayal of the titular Eddie Brock (truth), that the Venom: Lethal Protector story arc from 1991 will be adapted for the movie (rumor), that Ruben Fleischer is the perfect director for the movie (truth), that a version of She-Venom will appear (rumor), that Carnage will be a villain in the movie (truth), that a variety of actors have been linked to the role of Carnage (rumors), that it will have absolutely no ties to previous Spider-Man franchises (truth), that Silver Sable and Black Cat will appear (rumor) and that it will be ""R"" rated (truth). We hope you enjoy this video. Let us know your thoughts about it in the comments section and make sure you subscribe to our channel for more great videos just like this one.

Hey guys! This is the full release of the series in its 2 hour entirety like I promised. If you have already watched the 8 separate pieces then you have already seen it all, this does not add anything new. This is the video as it was presented to my patreon supporters more than a month ago. 

It took me an entire month to do this, from the planning phase to script writing, all the way to the editing. It was a very lengthy process but i am very satisfied with the result and i hope you are too! Enjoy :)

Well I wasn't expecting to have to glue up my boyfriends cracked head with my friend Josje onboard, 50nm away from land. It definitely could have been worse. It goes to show how quickly things could go wrong and it doesn't even necessarily have to be from something super risky or adventurous. We've swam off the back of the boat COUNTLESS times (and will continue to do so, but next time butts will be shuffled just that little bit further off the back before sliding in üòÇ). I'm just glad you're okay Riles. Thanks to Josje for being a legend and helping me mend this silly humans head.

Barbie car stats

Chassis -
Power Wheels 12V Battery Toy Ride-On - Barbie Ford Mustang - Pink

Engine - Honda 240cc single cylinder air cooled 4 stroke engine from a Honda CRF 230 dirt bike. Built with a performance cam and big bore kit.

Craigslist Go Kart - Home built?

We built this Barbie Mustang Go Kart in four days. First I found a used and abused go kart on craigslist and we got that running. Then we tore apart the Pink Power Wheels Mustang, cut the go kart chassis to fit in the toy car then pulled the motorcycle engine. We welded engine mounts in the front of the kart for better weight distribution then installed a 240cc Honda Dirtbike engine. This crazy kart build was an absolute blast and we will be doing and filming plenty of projects like this so stay tuned!

Low key we built this kart to race the boostedboiz with their Shopping Go Kart. Shopping Go Kart Does Wheelies?!

The oldest glue in the world is over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Today, we have enough types of tape and glue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue and tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Elizabeth Cox explores the world of adhesives.

Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is an upcoming massively multiplayer online survival video game developed and published by Bluehole Inc. for Xbox One & Microsoft Windows.

The concept of the game began when lead designer Brendan Greene, under the alias of Playerunknown, began working as a modder on Arma 2, creating a custom gamemode now known as ""battle royale"". The gamemode later shot off into other standalone games, such as Day Z and H1Z1: King of the Kill. Greene then made the decision to make his own standalone battle royale game after seeing the commercial success of the genre. The game was released on Steam's early access program in March 2017.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HIzS5cPzWZ0/hqdefault.jpg,0.006503393331366185,0.0010504573620537026,6.191011235955057,0.00010622602537621717,0.007553850693419886,0.007660076718796104,2018-04-05,23:45:19,Thursday,3,8,1,8,1,37,2,4,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.697197866366283,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'dog': 1}",2
