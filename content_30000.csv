Hellooooo! Before anyone asks, yes, my nails are real and I do them myself lol. 

It's been so long since I've done an anime-related look so I decided to show you guys my go-to anime-esque makeup! It has a strong 90's anime girl feel without feeling too costume-y! Imagine anime girl cosplay makeup, but more wearable for an everyday kind of basis! I hope you find my tips and tricks helpful! c: 

I spent a LOT of time editing this video, and considering that I'm a novice in editing and don't have money for expensive equipment, I hope you enjoy the effort I put into it anyways! ~

Oh, I also briefly explain why I take long breaks from youtube! The real reason is quite personal and difficult to explain, but thank you for being so understanding! ^x^

1. BigDog
The First Advanced Rough-Terrain Robot
The first legged robot to leave the lab and take on the real world.
BigDog has four legs that are articulated like an animal‚Äôs, with compliant elements to absorb shock and recycle energy from one step to the next. BigDog is the size of a large dog or small mule.

2. SpotMini
Good Things Come in Small Packages
A nimble robot that handles objects, climbs stairs, and will operate in offices, homes and outdoors.
SpotMini is a small four-legged robot that comfortably fits in an office or home.  It weighs 25 kg (30 kg if you include the arm). SpotMini is all-electric and can go for about 90 minutes on a charge, depending on what it is doing.

3. Atlas
The World's Most Dynamic Humanoid
Atlas uses balance and whole-body skills to achieve two-handed mobile manipulation.
Atlas is the latest in a line of advanced humanoid robots we are developing.  Atlas' control system coordinates motions of the arms, torso and legs to achieve whole-body mobile manipulation, greatly expanding its reach and workspace.  Atlas' ability to balance while performing tasks allows it to work in a large volume while occupying only a small footprint.

4. Handle
Legs & Wheels: The Best of Both Worlds
Handle combines wheels and legs to provide agile high-strength mobile manipulation.
Handle is a robot that combines the rough-terrain capability of legs with the efficiency of wheels. It uses many of the same principles for dynamics, balance, and mobile manipulation? found in the quadruped and biped robots we build, but with only 10 actuated joints, it is significantly less complex. Wheels are fast and efficient on flat surfaces while legs can go almost anywhere: by combining wheels and legs, Handle has the best of both worlds.

5. Spot
Takes a Kicking and Keeps on Ticking
Spot takes the lessons learned developing BigDog, Cheetah and LS3, and rolls them into a quiet four-legged robot with extraordinary rough terrain mobility and super-human stability.
Spot is a four-legged robot designed for indoor and outdoor operation.  It has been the breeding ground for a new approach to dynamic robot control that brings true autonomy within reach.

6. LS3
Legged Squad Support Systems
The AlphaDog of legged robots carries heavy loads over rough terrain.
LS3 was designed to go anywhere Marines and soldiers go on foot, helping carry their load. LS3 carries 182 kg of gear and enough fuel for a 32 km mission lasting 24 hours.  (In one test on flat terrain LS3 carried over 500 kg of payload.)  LS3 automatically follows its leader using computer vision, so it does not need a dedicated driver.

7. WildCat
The World‚Äôs Fastest Quadruped Robot
WildCat - the fastest quadruped robot on Earth. It runs 32 km/h while maneuvering and maintaining its balance. WildCat uses a galloping gait much like a dog or horse and leans into turns in order to maintain traction and balance.

8. SandFlea
Leaps Small Buildings in a Single Bound

Collider‚Äôs own Steve Weintraub recently spoke with The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson at the press day for the upcoming sequel, and the filmmaker revealed that his initial cut of the film ran over three hours. Almost every film gets shortened during the editing process as the filmmaker fine-tunes the story and pacing, but The Last Jedi marks a notable case given that Star Wars fans will want to pore over every single bit of footage available.

Johnson noted that while The Last Jedi‚Äôs final runtime is lengthy, the filmmaker knew this was always going to be a long movie ever since he put together the first cut:

    ‚ÄúWe had a long movie from the start. It was well over three hours, the first cut‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs much better at two and a half [hours] than it was at over three, but it was a cut I had put together, is where we started. And it was over three hours.‚Äù

Lyrics
(OPENING VERSE)
Cabin Crazy, Life's my day dream
Breaking Molds that people gave me
Lately Baby,
I've been feeling ways that make me
Feel like Shady
I'd been faded on the daily
I can feel my heart is changing
Coming back from Darkness
My whole Brain is rearranging
(CHORUS)
And I feel,
Like the world
Is the Dirt beneath my feet (REE)
And I feel, in this world, we can do anything. (WOOPWOOP)

(Young Lungs Verse)
Lately Head been spinning, I don't want to wake up
Things been changing fast, I told the future wait up
Thinking bout the times when you and me were laid up,
All I ever wanted was you being straight up.

1am we up in Oslo, gotta ride slow,
cause the time goes
So fast now, and the past now
Seems so far, cause my eyes low
I've been so faded, my flights been delaying,
And Life be so crazy like ""what?""
Pouring up lately, I know that they hate me,
But I don't hate myself as much.

And I been losing sight of everything yeah
I spent years and counting, chasing all these dreams yeah
Different flights today, Tomorrow a new thing yeah
Counting Money, soon I need a damn Machine yeah.

And I just took a flight out to LA now (and norway)
Sick and tired of wasting all my days now
And everything just starts to feel the same now
Made these movements, cause I need myself some change now

(CHORUS)
And I feel,
Like the world
Is the Dirt beneath my feet (REE)
And I feel, in this world, we can do anything. (WOOPWOOP)

(VERSE 3 NetNobody)
Focus on the Positives, The Negatives all shroud
Make my bank go Megalith, Gon Heretic full doubt
If you fuck with me please free it from your fucking mouth
Infinity in my day dreams, it's time to let it out
Society had carved a path to push against the grain
Notoriety had painted me with joy and pain
Travesty won't bother me, in my core I stay the same
No-one knows which way to go, so I'm paving my own way.

(CHORUS)
And I feel,
Like the world
Is the Dirt beneath my feet (REE)
And I feel, in this world, we can do anything. (WOOPWOOP)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bUBId1L96EY/sddefault.jpg,0.029259796338106023,0.0007605016529133268,38.47433628318584,0.005225476401566409,0.03002029799101935,0.03524577439258576,2017-11-25,21:00:24,Saturday,5,10,27,10,26,62,231,6,67,2,0,5,16,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.464962930256755,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

**The answer to your question: The reason I don't just dry it out and try to weight it - when dry, these flakes of gold would go everywhere with the slightest gust of wind. It's much easier to control and consolidate using mercury. Also, since the gold is so thin, the torch wouldn't actually melt, but vaporize the gold making it unrecoverable. Also, this way I'm able to make chunky little pieces of gold instead of just having the gold leaf I started with. Thanks again for watching and please feel free to comment anyway!

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy¬Æ Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

The third-generation Z31, which appeared in 1983, adopted the parallel rise-up headlamp that exposed a part of the lens even when it was turned off, while taking over the traditional concept of Z, the long nose and short deck.

A minor change was made in 1986, and a large air scoop and a T-bar roof in the center of the bonnet became exterior features due to the installation of a top-mounted intercooler.

The suspension employs a three-way adjustable shock absorber with three-stage damping force switching, and can be switched in three stages: soft / medium / hard.

I'm only one nigga (I'm only one nigga)
I can't be everywhere (ooh)
But I can take you anywhere, you know I swear, power girl

Yeah, I just had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel
You so fuckin' precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild
Girl, I lose myself up in those eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say
I'm so fucking happy you're alive
Swear to God, I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn into a bride, you're mine
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me

Lyrics:
Just a little bit tired of you
Just a little bit lonely for you
Just a little bit high get out of my mind
Cus I can't stop thinking of you

I feel a little bit sorry
But I wanna get on it with you
I don't wanna waste time I don't wanna say bye no

I feel it in my head
feel it in my heart
feel it in my body
But I can't say no
I can't say no

You're playing with my head
playing with my heart
playing with my body
But I cant let go
I can't let go

I fuckin hate you
But I love you just the same
You tear my heart out
In just the perfect way

so fucking twisted
The way I play your game
But I can't help it
I love you just the same

I'm a little bit crazy for you
Just sitting here waiting for you
I'm a little bit down I'm just gonna go out I don't wanna be home without you

I feel way too sorry
But I'm gonna get on it with you
It's the middle of the night and I'm not sayin bye no",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bYvDAYC8gwY/sddefault.jpg,0.023933231456447632,0.00022050806029922618,108.53676470588236,0.0005001965926640535,0.024153739516746858,0.024653936109410912,2018-01-26,05:00:01,Friday,4,8,1,8,1,51,2,3,2,0,0,6,0,3,0,6.0,2.0,"['Just the Same', '', 'Charlotte Lawrence', '', 'JUST THE SAME']","['Just', 'the', 'Same', 'Charlotte', 'Lawrence', 'JUST', 'THE', 'SAME']",True,"['just', 'the', 'same', 'charlott', 'lawrenc', 'just', 'the', 'same']",8,5,37,0,0,0,6,4.7840662315422335,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

New Line Cinema‚Äôs comedy ‚ÄúLife of the Party‚Äù stars Melissa McCarthy under the direction of Ben Falcone.

When her husband suddenly dumps her, longtime dedicated housewife Deanna (McCarthy) turns regret into re-set by going back to college‚Ä¶landing in the same class and school as her daughter, who‚Äôs not entirely sold on the idea. Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna‚Äînow Dee Rock‚Äîembraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.

The film also stars Gillian Jacobs (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Think Twice,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù), Maya Rudolph (‚ÄúBridesmaids,‚Äù ‚ÄúSisters‚Äù), Julie Bowen (‚ÄúModern Family‚Äù), Matt Walsh (‚ÄúVeep,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù), Molly Gordon (‚ÄúLove the Coopers,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnimal Kingdom‚Äù), with Stephen Root (‚ÄúMike and Dave Need Wedding Dates‚Äù), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (‚ÄúSilver Linings Playbook,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnimal Kingdom‚Äù), Jessie Ennis (‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù), Adria Arjona (‚ÄúTrue Detective,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmerald City‚Äù), Debby Ryan (‚ÄúJessie‚Äù) and Jimmy O. Yang (‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù).

McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.

Falcone‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (‚ÄúThe Boss,‚Äù ‚ÄúHorrible Bosses 2,‚Äù ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs Home‚Äù); production designer Rusty Smith (‚ÄúThe Boss‚Äù); editor Brian Olds (‚ÄúCentral Intelligence‚Äù); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the ‚ÄúThe Hangover‚Äù films). The music is by Fil Eisler (‚ÄúHow to Be Single,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù).

A SETI Talk on 1I/`Oumuamua, the first known interstellar small body, possibly an asteroid which is probably coming from another planetary system. Its recent discovery by Pan-STARRS1 offers a rare opportunity to explore the planetary formation processes of other stars, and the effect of the interstellar environment on a planetesimal surface. Since its discovery, astronomers around the world have raced to use the most powerful ground-based and space-borne telescopes to collect information on its nature. Two astronomers, Meg Schwamb, astronomer at the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and Matija Cuk, astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, will discuss the nature of 'Oumuamua, its color and shape in comparison with known small solar system bodies, as well as its origin derived from its extremely elongated shape and its orbit. They will show how its peculiarities seem to imply that 'Oumuamua is one of the most important discoveries of the decade in astronomy.

Matija Cuk is a Research Scientist at the SETI Institute. He received his Ph.D. degree from Cornell University in 2005. He uses computer simulations to study the past and present evolution of the orbits of the planets, moons and asteroids.  His recent work focused on the origin of Earth's Moon, as well as the moons and rings of Saturn. In 2014 he was awarded the Harold Urey Prize for early career achievement from the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society.

Meg Schwamb is an assistant scientist at the Gemini Observatory based in Hilo, Hawai'i. Meg's research focuses on how planets and their building blocks form and evolve, applying ground-based surveys to probe our Solar System's small body reservoirs. She is also involved in the Planet Four citizen science projects, which enlists the public to help study the seasonal processes of the Martian south pole and map the distribution of ridges on the Martian mid-latitudes. Meg also serves as co-chair of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope's Solar System Science Collaboration. Meg was awarded the 2017 Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science from the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Science.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b_vAcv7JGhQ/sddefault.jpg,0.007004238972049278,0.0008444827129421115,8.294117647058824,0.002649357530798781,0.007848721684991391,0.010498079215790173,2018-01-25,01:55:17,Thursday,3,6,1,6,1,50,2,2,2,0,0,6,0,1,0,8.0,2.0,"['CMSs', '', 'te', '', 'THE FIRST KNOWN', 'NGL GHE CA Cice).‚Ñ¢', '', 'TV Ole rn alUe-Tan\\ er) ye']","['CMSs', 'te', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'KNOWN', 'NGL', 'GHE', 'CA', 'Cice).‚Ñ¢', 'TV', 'Ole', 'rn', 'alUe-Tan\\', 'er)', 'ye']",True,"['cmss', 'te', 'the', 'first', 'known', 'ngl', 'ghe', 'CA', 'cice', ')', '.‚Ñ¢', 'TV', 'ole', 'rn', 'alue-tan\\', 'er', ')', 'ye']",18,17,55,2,2,0,1,5.273650724365999,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

In this VladTV exclusive, Lord Jamar sounds off on Tyrese crying on camera. Jamar thinks the videos are both sad and funny at the same time. ‚ÄúYeah he‚Äôs bugged out, but at the same time he does appear to love his daughter‚Äù, said Jamar. 

Jamar and Vlad also discuss Tyrese calming to be broke while living in a mansion. ‚ÄúI thought Tyrese had it together he seemed like he had it together‚Äù, Jamar expressed. 

Furthermore, he questions whether or not Tyrese is really broke if he appeared in all the Fast and Furious films.

The original arcade Donkey Kong game was created when Shigeru Miyamoto was assigned by Nintendo to convert Radar Scope, a game that had been released to test audiences with poor results, into a game that would appeal more to Americans. The result was a major breakthrough for Nintendo and for the videogame industry. Sales of the machine were brisk, with the game becoming one of the best-selling arcade machines of the early 1980s. The gameplay itself was a large improvement over other games of its time, and with the growing base of arcades to sell to, it was able to gain huge distribution. In the game, 'Jumpman' (the character would later become Mario) must ascend a construction site while avoiding obstacles such as barrels and fireballs to rescue Pauline, his girlfriend, from Donkey Kong. Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports include the Atari 2600, Colecovision, Amiga 500, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC booter, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to the Family Computer in 1983 as one of the system's three launch titles; the same version was a launch title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an item for purchase on the Wii's Virtual Console.

Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (‚Äú24,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Larry Sanders Show‚Äù), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (‚ÄúER,‚Äù ‚ÄúJustified‚Äù), Peter Macon as Bortus (‚ÄúShameless,‚Äù ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (‚ÄúNeighbors,‚Äù ‚ÄúGoosebumps‚Äù), J.

Disclaimer: LA Colors Powder and Shany palette were sent to me by their brands/PR companies. All other products were purchased by me. These are my own, honest opinions. Not a sponsored video - I have never accepted money from a company in exchange for a video. 

(With the exception of LA Colors powder, the items listed above are accompanied by affiliate links, meaning I earn a small commission if a purchase is made through my links. This has no impact on the cost to the consumer. I link to products this way whenever possible, and it has no bearing on the products I choose to review or recommend. I would link the products on Ulta/Sephora/whatever brand‚Äôs website anyway as a means of connecting you to further info on the products, so now it simply offers the potential for a slight financial benefit to me, which I greatly appreciate as I do not ever do sponsored videos. Feel free to use, or not use, the links provided. I do not have any coupon codes. After being asked in the comments section about links/coupon codes/how they work and why I use them, I felt like providing this explanation! Thanks!)

And the rebel alliance of the fans has struck a mighty blow against the evil empire led by Darth Kennedy. This shows that WE have the control over whether a Star Wars film is a success or not. So JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy might want to re-think their disrespectful attitude towards the fans. Disney can either profit from this or be destroyed, its their choice, but I warn them not to underestimate our power.

The island is not prepared for the approaching cold spell, and conditions in the camps are catastrophic. Resistance is growing ‚Äì among migrants and locals alike.

Despite the EU-Turkey refugee deal, the Greek island of Lesbos has seen a surge in the number of new arrivals in recent weeks. Ahmed Al-Majeed is one of them. The 27-year-old ran a bookshop in his native Iraq, before he was forced to flee from so-called Islamic State. Two months ago, he reached Lesbos. He says refugees like him are being treated like animals. The island‚Äôs official refugee camp is bursting; its facilities are anything but hygienic. Ahmed lives next door in a makeshift camp, but things are not much better there. Many locals are also fed up with the situation. They're demanding the authorities move the refugees to the mainland. Stelios is a shepherd who says more than 40 of his sheep have been killed by refugees. He says they come at night to steal them, even security cameras don't help. His ancient olive trees have also been damaged. Stelios and Ahmed agree the situation is untenable.

Lyrics:

I'll make the sun rise, wake for you
I'll make the mountains come to you
I'll draw a rainbow on your face
I'll keep you wild, you keep me safe

If you get lost than I‚Äôll find out that you‚Äôre beautiful
If I get old with you then it‚Äôs wonderful
If we‚Äôd live a life that is half as magical
Just as magical as you...

Vive vivere
Love is in the air
I see it in your eyes
One life to vivere

You made the sun rise, wake for me
I had the mountains to my knees
I see the colours when I‚Äôm blue
You got me good and I got you

If you get lost than I‚Äôll find out that you‚Äôre beautiful
If I get old with you then it‚Äôs wonderful
If we‚Äôd live a life that is half as magical
Just as magical as you...

With you there‚Äôs no limit
I cut open, give in
The sky‚Äôs not too high
I knew in a minute
Our life will be thrilling
I open my eyes
And it‚Äôs not a dream
We‚Äôre living this life",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bm_lKPs91Aw/sddefault.jpg,0.004282998998279095,0.0001777341784769271,24.097779250911497,7.982426643561027e-05,0.004460733176756022,0.0045405574431916325,2018-05-07,19:09:57,Monday,0,8,72,8,41,46,531,4,97,0,0,6,0,0,0,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.468688850072252,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

This show was part of the Melodrama World Tour. [Filmed by Lorde_fix, Sat 11th of November 2017]
She only performed WITD 3 times on the NZ/Aus leg of the tour and I was very fortunate to be at 2 of those shows. The audience was more rowdy during her acapella in Wellington than it was in Christchurch a few nights before (https://youtu.be/ZwWyX0q4wcI), despite her trying hard to indicate that they should be quiet so that she could hear.

At 0:46 she removes one of her in ear monitors.

The acoustics in this venue were amazing (my camera mic doesn't do it justice).

Sorry the footage of the second song is a bit shaky. I like to live in the moment, so I just held the camera against my chest and pointed it in the general direction without looking at it. There was no way I was staying still during Loveless! I'm surprised it came out as well as it did.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bnVoT-CKI7I/sddefault.jpg,0.035921068179132695,0.00011816140848398912,304.0,0.001536098310291859,0.036039229587616683,0.03757532789790855,2018-02-25,01:09:40,Sunday,6,15,38,15,37,87,350,10,85,1,2,10,14,2,2,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.3128238171920605,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'tv': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Of course this movie review is going to be a non spoiler review because I do not want to spoil anything from the Justice League for you guys! I have to say right off the bat guys this movie is awesome! As you all can tell in my review I love this Justice League movie from beginning to end and there are very few negatives for the movie. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives for this movie and all of the heroes are perfect in their roles. Justice League has been on of the most anticipated superhero movies for a long time ever since the DCEU got started and the wait pays off for all DC superhero fans! I cannot recommend this movie enough to people because it is that good. So I hope you all enjoy my spoiler free Justice League Movie Review and decide to become apart of the Webhead Community today!

LYRICS

She's gone ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.2000 miles
It's very far
The snow is falling down‚Ä¶
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

The children were singing
She'll be back at Christmas time

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream‚Ä¶
you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow‚Ä¶
sparkle

Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles‚Ä¶
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go oh‚Ä¶..

She's gone 2000 miles
It's very far
The snow is falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

I can hear people singing
It must be Christmas time

I hear people singing
It must be Christmas time¬†

Solo: A Star Wars Story, or simply Solo, is a 2018 American space Western film about Han Solo, a character from the Star Wars franchise. The film is directed by Ron Howard and produced by Lucasfilm, from a screenplay by Jonathan and Lawrence Kasdan. It is the second of the Star Wars anthology films, following 2016's Rogue One. A stand-alone installment set between the events of Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, it explores the adventures of younger versions of Han Solo and Chewbacca, who also meet a young Lando Calrissian. The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, alongside Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Joonas Suotamo, and Paul Bettany.

Principal photography began in January 2017 at Pinewood Studios, under the direction of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. The pair left the project in June 2017 after reportedly being fired over ""creative differences"" with Lucasfilm, and Howard took over directing duties

Dieci anni dopo Mamma Mia! il film che ha incassato oltre 600 milioni di dollari in tutto il mondo, siete invitati a tornare nella magica isola greca di Kalokairi in un nuovo ed originale musical basato sulle canzoni degli ABBA. Il film segna il ritorno del cast originale affiancato da nuovi membri tra cui Lily James (L‚ÄôOra Pi√π Buia; Cenerentola; Baby Driver ‚Äì Il genio della fuga).

Mamma mia! Ci risiamo √® prodotto da Judy Craymer e Gary Goetzman, gli stessi produttori del film originale. Craymer √® anche il creatore e produttore del musical di successo a livello mondiale.

Ol Parker, sceneggiatore di Marigold Hotel, ha scritto e diretto questo sequel da una storia di Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis e Parker. Benny Andersson e Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus hanno nuovamente curato le musiche e i testi, oltre ad aver collaborato alla produzione esecutiva. Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis e Nicky Kentish Barnes sono i produttori esecutivi.

Riprendono i loro ruoli di Mamma Mia! Il film l‚Äôattrice premio Oscar¬Æ Meryl Streep nella parte di Donna; Julie Walters in quella di Rosie, e Christine Baranski in quella di Tanya. Amanda Seyfried e Dominic Cooper interpretano nuovamente Sophie e Sky, mentre Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsg√•rd e il premio Oscar¬Æ Colin Firth tornano nei ruoli dei tre possibili padri di Sophie: Sam, Bill e Harry.

Il film, andando avanti e indietro nel tempo per mostrare come le relazioni forgiate nel passato risuonano nel presente, vede Lili James interpretare il ruolo di Donna da giovane. Rosie e Tanya da giovani invece sono ritratte rispettivamente da Alexa Davies (X+Y - A Brilliant Young Mind), e Jessica Keenan Wynn (Beautiful a Broadway). Il giovane Sam √® interpretato da Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), mentre il giovane Bill √® Josh Dylan (Allied: Un‚Äôombra nascosta) e il giovane Harry √® Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bskK1bjp8MM/sddefault.jpg,0.0041582828963020015,0.0001058472009967782,39.285714285714285,5.1411497627006563e-05,0.00426413009729878,0.004315541594925786,2018-01-25,08:30:01,Thursday,3,10,62,10,61,59,536,2,104,1,0,7,51,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.789273477800697,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'boat': 1, 'person': 12}",13

Our first look at the Venom movie did not disappoint... unless you were hoping to catch a glimpse of the titular character in action. While it didn't deliver any footage of Venom itself, it did provide a few tidbits for us to break down and theorize about. These are the things you may have missed in the brand new Venom teaser trailer!

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Steven Spielberg returns to making fun popcorn movies with the adaption of Ready Player One. Part of what makes this book and film so cool is the copious amounts of pop culture references scattered throughout. Some are blink and you‚Äôll miss it while others are super obscure and known only to the super fans. We saw the film and saw so many references (and missed even more we‚Äôre sure) and thought we‚Äôd share our findings with you! Some deal with the relationship between the book and the film, such as the subtle nod to the game Joust which book readers will understand. Others tie back to the trailer and the significance of the Rush song that played during it. Spielberg claimed he wouldn‚Äôt use any of his own films in Ready Player One, but a certain dinosaur may have made an appearance, sharing a scene with King Kong, Mad Max‚Äôs car, the batmobile, the A-Team‚Äôs van, Kaneda‚Äôs bike from Akira and the DeLorean from Back to the Future. The boombox from Say Anything is shown, playing the battle anthem in the film‚Äôs climax. John Hughes is referenced but the red ferrari is seen in the film, along with the Eagle 5 from Spaceballs, sharing a scene with the Iron Giant. Some Street Fighter references can be found in the film, along with Tracer and Lara Craft from Tomb Raider and there‚Äôs a blink and you‚Äôll miss it reference to Robocop.  We get a great fan service moment with Firefly and Gundam and we get some great moments for fans of the Halo games. Yup, this one has a lot of references.

The video consists of 16 simple life hacks that you can do yourself:

1. Cloud lamp made from a plastic bottle. Just fill it with a LED strip, apply glue all over the bottle and stick it with cotton wool.  

2. Simple plastic bottle trick to use it as egg yolk separator

3.  Make a phone charger holder from a used plastic shampoo bottle by cutting it and making a hole for a cord with a utility knife. To decorate it simply use colorful tapes.  

4. Salt/pepper shaker made from two plastic bottle tops, use your utility knife to cut them off. Then glue them together and make holes with a drill in bottle caps for your salt/pepper.

5. Use plastic bottles to make a toothbrush holder. Cut the top and bottom parts of the bottle, then simply glue them together and make several holes to insert bottlenecks for your toothbrushes.

6. Make a cozy rope lamp by cutting the upper half of a plastic bottle, cover it in PVA glue and use a colorful rope to wrap around for decoration. Cut the bottleneck to insert a light bulb (use light bulbs that don't produce heat!).

7. A simple package for your small gifts made from the middle part of a plastic bottle, just flatten it out, bend the edges and don't forget to tie a ribbon!

8  Make a simple tree painting by using the bottom part of a plastic bottle as a leaf stamp. Simply cover the bottom with acrylic paint and stamp it on a sheet of paper.

9. Use an old plastic shampoo bottle to make a dish sponge holder, simply by cutting out part of the bottle and using a candle (or any other heat source) to bend it so it would fit over your tap.

10. Make a rain protector for your cord extender simply by using a plastic bottle and cutting off the bottom part using a box cutter so your cord extender would fit in. 

11. A small gift package for candy using two plastic bottles. Simply cut out the middle parts of the bottles, bend them into squares and put one over the another. Don't forget the ribbon for decoration!

12. Use the bottom part of a plastic bottle to create this simple flower pot. Apply some acrylic paint and/or marker to decorate it with the design of your choice!

13. Make a candle holder from two plastic bottles by cutting one bottleneck longer for the base and a shorter one to insert your candle. Then simply glue them together.

14. A flower pot made by simply cutting the top of a plastic bottle with a box cutter, then cut from the top vertically to make decorative strips. Unfold the strips back and interlace them with each other. Use acrylic paint to decorate in your own way!   

15. A pencil holder for your kids made from an empty old shampoo bottle. To make this just cut out the shape with a pair of scissors,  then glue decorations made from paper to create your own character design!

16. Use a plastic bottle to make a holder for your thread. Just cut the bottom part of the bottle, then make a hole the size of a bottle cap. Cut half of the bottle from bottom vertically and insert your thread so that the end comes out from the bottleneck.

A combination of workouts focus on ""pliability,"" or adding flexibility to muscles through a series of workouts with resistance bands.

Some, have questioned the legitimacy of the pliability concept. In an interview with the New York Times, one muscle physiology expert called it ""balderdash.""

Recently, I was invited to visit the TB12 sports therapy center located in the shadow of Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts to get a one-on-one workout with Alex Guerrero. He's the creator of the TB12 method and has worked with Brady as a personal trainer and body coach since 2004. I also asked Guerrero to respond to some of the criticism the TB12 method has received.¬†The following is a transcript of the video.¬†

Graham Flanagan: We're here in the TB12 sports therapy center here in Foxborough with Alex Guerrero, creator of the TB12 method.¬†

Guerrero and Brady have worked together since 2004. They opened the TB12 center in 2013

Flanagan: I want you to take me through a circuit that you might go through with Tom Brady.¬†

Alex Guerrero: We'll do some things to get you warmed up here and then get your core activated, and then we'll get going. 

So, we're gonna get him on the X-ciser. Let's go, Graham. Hold tight. Arms straight! Gotta engage that core. Engage those glutes. There you go. Breathe, Graham. Breathe. There we go. Let's pick up the pace. So, don't move those knees.

Flanagan: Don't bend the knees?

Guerrero: Nope, you're right here. So always ‚Äî right, so full ranges, right?

Flanagan: So all the way here?

Guerrero: That's a bad exercise for him, right? You're not ready for that one yet.¬†

One of the main principles of the TB12 method is ""muscle pliability""

Guerrero: Pliability is simply a way to maintain, you know, your muscles long and lean and soft, and it allows the joints in your body to move efficiently and correctly without putting loads on your tendons or your structure.¬†

Some have questioned the scientific validity of pliability. One muscle physiology expert called it ""balderdash""

Guerrero: You know, to sit there and say there's no such real thing as pliability ‚Äì that, to me, is balderdash!¬†¬†We have a lot of laypeople that come here every day. We've had a lot of really elite athletes that have come from all over the world to come here. And I would say, you can't unknow what you know, right? Like, once you experience it and you feel it and you realize the differences it's making in your life ‚Äì like, that guy who said it was balderdash, he's never gonna be able to convince these people that it didn't work.¬†

Push. Bring that arm out. Punch. Punch hard with the arm and kick back with that leg. There we go. Stay on those toes.¬†

Flanagan: So, what's your sort of takeaway. What's the verdict on me after that little session?¬†

Guerrero: So, we definitely do have some issues, right? You have, you know, hip-instability issues. You have no glute-facilitation, right? Your core is not as strong as it should be, because as you age and get older, those loads are gonna go somewhere, Graham. So, at some point you're gonna be like, ""Wow, you know, I'm starting to get neck pain, or ""I'm starting to get some nerve impingement"" or ""I've some cervical compression.""

Simple piece of advice would be: work on core-stabilization, glute facilitation.¬†

Flanagan: Cool!

Travis from iwonder TV went to go meet Stanely Thornton and learn about why he lives as an adult baby.  Living as an adult baby or ab with Stanley Thornton.  Being an adult baby or ab you get to live as a baby in every day life.  Like any other baby, Stanley sleeps in a crib, wears diapers, and loves nothing better than being comforted by his bottle. He spends his days role playing with Lego's as he drinks his bottle, plays with his pacifier, and colors in his coloring book.  For some people being an adult baby is a more adult role playing for them, but for Stanley he does it to relax and feel safe.  He first began his return to childhood when he was 14, as a way of coping when he started wetting the bed after being abused as a boy.  He started wearing diapers when he was 13, and then gradually realized he still wanted the comforts of being a baby. He relates to being a 2 year old baby.  At 20, he began 'day wetting' and now wears a diaper every day.  In 2000, he started website for other adult babies where members can find 'mothers or babies and tips on where to buy diapers.

So, the word ""Bizarro"" has two different meanings. It can just be a fun way of saying the word ""bizarre"" but it can also mean an alternate, more peculiar reality. That meaning comes from the ""Bizarro World"" comics of the 1960s, where the world is a cube and Superman is bad...that kind of thing.

So this is a Bizarro History of Black Friday...a history of a different Earth. I hope you like it.

Aerial footage shot on Saturday showed a wide flow of fast-moving lava advancing to the southeast at rates of over 270 meters per hour. The flow was nearly 2.4 kilometers from the ocean, scientists said.

The footage also showed lava fountaining about 100 meters high at one of the fissures.

As magma destroyed four more homes, it was expected to hit Highway 137 overnight if it kept up its rate and direction of flow, according to the County of Hawaii's Civil Defense Agency said.

Strawinsky: I see. You‚Äôre also affected by the books.
Globglo: From time to time. I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶

Globglo: Well, I‚Ä¶
Gulbert: (runs into the living room) She‚Äôs coming! She‚Äôs coming! We‚Äôre lost! She‚Äôs coming!
Narrator: A breathless and highly agitated Gulbert Bibberkrall came running into the mansion. 
Strawinsky: Who‚Äôs coming?
Globglo: You‚Äôre quite beside yourself my friend!
Gulbert: By and large I am quite beside myself ‚Äì aahh! What‚Äôs that? The flooring, the beautiful floorboards, the expensive, valuable flooring. I can‚Äôt believe it, I really can‚Äôt believe it. That must be you, that must have been you, that must have been you again, the Gloggli, Globgli-thingy...
Globglo: Globglogabgalab.
Gulbert: This is now the second time, the second time in two weeks, the second time in two weeks that something like this has happened. Last week he turned into a dragon and nearly burned down the house. Outrageous, simply outrageous. 
Globglo: I‚Äôm very sorry. The dragon had a cold and had to sneeze. 
Strawinsky: Does that happen to you very often?
Globglo: Occasionally, when I‚Äôm not careful. 
Gulbert: Ha! When he‚Äôs not careful! When he‚Äôs not careful ‚Äìwhen he over-eats. 
Globglo: Over-eat?
Strawinsky: You just have to be careful with what you consume.
Globglo: But, Mr Troll, please tell us what terrible thing you have seen? Who‚Äôs coming?
Gulbert: Who‚Äôs coming? Ahh hmm ‚Äì ahhh!! ‚Äì Ahh yes ‚Äì the Scarlet Queen is coming. Somebody must have called her. Who did that? She will kill us! 
Globglo: Oh! If the Scarlet Queen comes then we are all doomed!
Strawinsky: But why do you think that? 
Globglo: The Scarlet Queen is generally acting on behalf of the great Elohim, isn‚Äôt she? And the great Elohim told me through her that I need to make a decision about whom I want to serve. Him or the Ratking. Well, but I don‚Äôt want to serve anyone. I only want my books. That‚Äòs why I‚Äôve been hiding here. I‚Äôve been here for two weeks now. 
Gulbert: And I was supposed to multiply the gold. But I didn‚Äôt do it, I just hid it. But now it‚Äôs all over.

Sofia, Music history
Oh baby

I'm thinking maybe that you were always
A piece of shhh...
You're rubbing your dirt on everyone's skirt
You know how to be a ddd...

Donde est√°n tus modales
Que no aprendiste ni a saludar
Parece que hoy me gustas un poco m√°s

Hola comment allez, allez-vous
So nice to meet you
You say we should go
And get a room uhmm, no

If you wanna turn it on
Go get a lightbulb, despu√©s hablamos
If you wanna turn it on
Go get a lighter, despu√©s bailamos

123, 123
Si te doy un beso ya estas a mis pies
Dime 123, 123
La la la, la la la

Oh baby just hush the talking
And let my loving ease your mind
If love's the game let's play a million times
Baby give it to me I'll be good company
Baby mi nombre es Jason Derulo

If you wanna turn it on
Go get a lightbulb, despu√©s hablamos
If you wanna turn it on
Go get a lighter, despu√©s bailamos

123, 123
Si te doy un beso ya est√°s a mis pies
Dime 123, 123
La la la, la la la

Disculpe la ignorancia nunca quise lastimarte
Lo que quiero es transformarte en mi
Diosa mi obra de arte
Dime si tu quiere me da igual c√≥mo se hace
Prendemos toda la noche y a las nubes voy a llevarte

Quiero yo ense√±arte mucha' cosa' interesante
Convertirte en mi dama, en la cama amarrarte
Besarte de arriba a abajo pa' ponerlo interesante
Despu√©s de todo esto nunca vas a olvidarte

Hola comment allez, allez-vous...

It's 'bout time we go and get a room...

If you wanna turn it on
Go get a lightbulb, despu√©s hablamos
If you wanna turn it on
Go get a lighter, despu√©s bailamos

Ohh
123, 123
Si te doy un beso ya estas a mis pies
Dime 123, 123

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bzZa3h9TMhU/sddefault.jpg,0.011438516473624198,0.0003480765768469063,32.86206896551724,0.00033607393626597853,0.011786593050471104,0.012122666986737082,2018-01-31,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,11,38,10,33,63,334,1,79,1,1,7,14,4,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.140506550426995,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Check out the FINGERLINGS! http://bit.ly/MeetAllTheFingerlings

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyonc√© of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST and on Thursdays at 5pm EST I do LIVE STREAMS!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make my Fingerlings Cake, I added LOTS of purple sprinkles to my Ultimate Vanilla Cake batter because MIA is a flawless purple, and I wanted to reflect that BOTH inside & out. I iced each layer with chocolate ganache, and decorated it with Italian Meringue Buttercream, Rice Krispie treats & SWEET purple and beige fondant. Plus, I even made it so that she could wrap her arms around a GIANT finger, or you know... a rolling pin - just like the toy!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

A pig's heart!) as well as terrifying love notes with messages saying, ""If I can't have you, no one can.""

Many are the result of kids' lifestyles and are, according to the experts, causing them unnecessary suffering.

With unprecedented access to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, this documentary meets the kids, the pediatricians treating them and follows them home in an attempt to uncover the root cause of their problems. It is clear that some of the basic health messages from the doctors are not getting through to parents.

The A&E is a busy department and having to deal with cases such as drunk children is not only time consuming for staff, but can be upsetting for other young patients too. Operations on dental, glue ear and obesity cases are helping clog up a system that's already under considerable strain. The hospital estimates they spend around a million pounds a year on treating preventable conditions, enough to buy them a new MRI scanner.

The Good, the Bad & the Messy ‚Äì our channel features documentaries and shows about stories of modern parenting. Through a mixture of original & archive content, we explore a range of captivating subjects; education styles, complex relationships, food habits, the challenges of large families‚Ä¶

One of the questions I get asked most often is ‚ÄúWho do you like better NASA or SpaceX‚Äù

Although I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to compare a government agency to a private company in general, there is one thing we can truly compare apples to apples. Or shall I say rockets to rockets. And that‚Äôs rockets. Wait. (derp)

So in this video we‚Äôre going to look at some rockets past, present and future from SpaceX and NASA and check out their capabilities, costs and over all designs in an attempt to really help compare the two.

So NASAs rockets vs SpaceX‚Äôs rockets‚Ä¶ considering what we  learned in the last video, this one might get interesting. Let‚Äôs get started!

I can't believe this episode is finally out. We filmed it this summer so it's been a long time coming. Thank you so so so much everybody who helped make this happen! Working together with you is one of the best experiences I've ever had. Also I'm sorry Daryl, your life was short and terrible. I would also like to apologize to the Malaysian Crocodilefish who appears in this episode. I think you are beautiful and one of the finest actors I have ever worked with.

Full lyrics below:

Yo the 2018, the Olympian
Games are in PyeongChang, that's South Korean
The stadium apparently is the house to be in
And girls say that Tongan dude's Herculean 

Gerard got the gold early, I heard him cussin'
Only 17, still doper than the Russians
Nathan Chen came to win, 
Shib Sibs said to let the games begin

Then Mirai Nagasu said, ""I gotchu
I'll do the impossible."" We said, ""I'll watchu
Rock the triple axel and then bring it back to the U.S.
Girl you just the queen of the castle.""

Who the champions? You know we them.
There's no Kourtney, but there's Chloe Kim
Who went on the attack, what's better than that?
She won a gold medal, go and get her a snack.

I must admit the games have been a whirlwind,
Skating, skiing, swirling, but what‚Äôs curling?
When you find out, hit me back. 
Aight, that's the end of this Olympics rap.

The US says three targets were struck - a research facility in Damascus and storage facilities near Homs
Russia said missiles were also aimed at other targets but many were intercepted by air defences
President Trump said the allies had ""marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality""
Russia's president Putin condemned the strikes and called for an urgent UN meeting
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says the ""aggression"" has redoubled Syria's determination to ""crush terrorism""

LYRICS
How did I get here?
And what have I done?
Feels like I've been sleeping for two years
And I'm just waking up
Like I'm coming out of a black out
Like I didn't see you till right now
I look around and I'm feeling
like I built a prison and put myself in it

I don‚Äôt wanna go through the motions
No I don‚Äôt wanna

I can't stand it when you touch me like that
Cause it just reminds me of the nights that I spent
Telling myself it was fine, but now I'm over that
I think it's better if we just pretend
that we're just strangers again

Where do I go now?
And where do I start?
I don't wanna pick up the pieces
I just wanna watch it all fall apart
Fall apart like it should
Fall apart like I said it would
I wanted out but you held me down
And fed me the lies
I told to myself

I don‚Äôt wanna go through the motions
No I don‚Äôt wanna

I can't stand it when you touch me like that
Cause it just reminds me of the nights that I spent
Telling myself it was fine, but now I'm over that
I think it's better if we just pretend
that we're just strangers again

We had what we had but it's done and I'm over it
Held on for too long and I should have let go of it
I knew it was wrong but I tried to keep hold of it
It was wrong it was wrong it was wrong",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c6fqx3q_08M/sddefault.jpg,0.013866845330878879,0.00027588926092413264,50.26235992089652,0.00046521076430054806,0.014142734591803015,0.014607945356103562,2018-05-14,15:01:15,Monday,0,7,53,7,39,53,402,3,54,2,1,5,21,3,14,7.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.813443344067832,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

More evidence has emerged showing that the gunman, a 19-year-old former student named Nikolas Cruz, shared a common trait with many other men who have carried out mass shootings: He had a record of abusing and threatening women. On Thursday, a white nationalist hate group called the Republic of Florida Militia also claimed the gunman was a member who had trained with the militia, but the group‚Äôs leader later walked back the claim. Former classmates of Cruz did describe him as politically extreme and espousing racist beliefs. For more, we speak with George Ciccariello-Maher, a visiting scholar at the Hemispheric Institute at New York University and the author of ‚ÄúDecolonizing Dialectics,‚Äù and Trevor Aaronson, executive director and co-founder of the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting and a contributing writer to The Intercept.

We continue with the start of the refit on our Endeavour 32. Our first goal is to make the boat as water-tight as possible, and the old portlights leak so bad they've made it to priority one. We remove all of our 10 portlights in this video, but not without a fight. Either the original yard or a previous owner (there were many) used an adhesive instead of sealant to bed the portlights, making them almost impossible to remove without damage. Because of this, it doesn't look like we'll be able to refurbish and replace ANY of them, so we're now looking for affordable new portlights to replace them.

In the epic finale to the Maze Runner saga, Thomas leads his group of escaped Gladers on their final and most dangerous mission yet. To save their friends, they must break into the legendary Last City, a WCKD-controlled labyrinth that may turn out to be the deadliest maze of all. Anyone who makes it out alive will get answers to the questions the Gladers have been asking since they first arrived in the maze.

About Spectre Sound Studios: 
I'm Glenn Fricker, engineer here at Spectre Sound Studios. I love making records, and after doing it for sixteen years, I want to pass on what I've learned. On my channel you can find tutorials on how to record guitar, bass, real drums and vocals. There's reviews and demos of tube amps, amp sims, drums, mics, preamps, outboard gear, Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar, and plugin effects. 
We've covered Moon on the Water, played Bias FX,  given you the absolute best in Stupid Musician Texts, ranted & raved about bass guitar,  and this channel is where The Eagle has Landed.
Everything you've wanted to learn about recording Hard Rock & Heavy Metal can be found right here on this channel! 

I also respond to your comments & questions: The best make it into the SMG Viewer's Comments series of videos.  Loads of fun, lots of laughs.

Lyrics

Nothing can save us, nothing between
Infinite madness and the spiral of humanity
Nothing controls us, nothing breeds
The void awakens in the quickening of atrophy
Answer no master, never the slave
Carry your dreams down into the grave
Every heart, like every soul
Equal to break
It‚Äôs alive
Can you feel it taking hold again
In your mind
All your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain
Nothing kills us, nothing seethes
Extinction riding on the pale horse of destiny
Nothing hates us, nothing can see
Through our eyes it dives into our minds
And sows its disease
Answer no master, never the slave
Carry your dreams down into the grave
Every heart, like every soul
Equal to break
It‚Äôs alive
Can you feel it taking hold again
In your mind
All your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain
It‚Äôs alive, can you feel it
It‚Äôs alive
Can you feel it taking hold again
In your mind
All your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain

By 2016, though, this figure had fallen to just 5% and drug use and smoking had also sharply declined. The action plan that led to this dramatic success is sometimes called ‚Äúthe Icelandic Model‚Äù ‚Äì and strikingly, it does not focus on tighter policing or awareness campaigns to warn children off bad habits. Instead, top researchers collaborate closely with communities on initiatives like parental pledges and night-time patrols after dark, while the government invests in recreational facilities. But is being a teenager in Iceland still fun?

One of the places I was most excited to visit in Mexico for food (Comida Oaxaque√±a) is Oaxaca. Oaxaca has one of the most developed and advanced food cultures in all of Mexico. For our first day, we set out on a Mexican street food tour of Oaxaca, eating everything we could see.

Mercado de Abastos - We began the morning at one of the biggest local fresh food markets in Oaxaca. I samples a Tamal de Mole - 11 MXN ($0.59) and a hot Chocolate - 10 MXN ($0.53), both of which were delicious, and a great way to start this tour.

Soup - 30 MXN ($1.60) per bowl - The market was just opening, but there was a busy soup stall, so we stopped to have a bowl. The fish and shrimp soup were both delicious.

Memelas - 30 MXN ($1.60) total - One of the ultimate Mexican street foods to try in Oaxaca is memalas, a round of masa, cooked and topped with salsa and cheese, and your choice of other toppings. We got it with grilled meat on top. It was delicious, one of the best things I ate throughout the day.

Carnitas - 30 MXN ($1.60) total - This was just a quick impulse taco on the go because it looked so good‚Ä¶ it was.

Z√≥calo Oaxaca, Plaza de Santo Domingo - The center of Oaxaca is a pleasant place to hang out, only today there happen to be a protest going on, so it was a bit busy.

Mercado 20 de Noviembre - Meat combo - 300 MXN ($16.02) - This is one of the great meat halls of the world. You walk in to the meat sauna, choose your meat, they grill it all in front of you, and you eat it with tortillas and salsa. An amazing food paradise.

Tlayudas El Negro - Tlayudas are another common Oaxacan street food, using giant tortillas filled with beans, cabbage, and cheese, and then grilled. 
Price - 80 MXN ($4.27) for 1

Monte Alb√°n - Resting our stomachs, we did a little sightseeing in Oaxaca. One of the famous attractions are the ruins of Monte Alban. 

Elote - 20 MXN ($1.07) - You‚Äôll find elotes, a corn on the cobb with cheese and salsas, all over Mexico. It‚Äôs one of the most common Mexican street foods‚Ä¶ but this guy is at the main plaza of Oaxaca is on another level. His style is champion!

Mole negro - 60 MXN ($3.20) per plate - Finally to end this Mexican street food tour of Oaxaca, we needed to have a plate of mole negro, one of the national dishes of Oaxaca.

It was an amazing day of food. Oaxaca has such a rich culture of food and friendly people.

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy¬Æ Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cGnXZN7BN1w/sddefault.jpg,0.011602576154646018,0.0001592350578042445,72.8644578313253,0.0005554042076425153,0.011761811212450264,0.012317215420092778,2018-03-20,01:11:35,Tuesday,1,17,52,17,50,98,484,3,121,1,3,13,0,4,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6781454196434735,2,"['happy', 'scared']",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

(Michel)
Bu√© de fumo tipo chamin√© 
Bu√© de bitches tipo um Cabaret 
Bebida √© tanta tipo tou a vender
Eu nem consigo me manter de p√© 

(Zara G)
Eu fa√ßo um baby enquanto a baby bebe
Eu tou nas nuvens nem comprei bilhete 
Eu tou no topo tipo a easyget 
A baby chupa eu sou exigente 


Ey
Eu tou ressacado a cozinhar no est√∫dio na minha cabe√ßa tem uma sopa de letras 
Mau da fita avisa nesses niggas que esses caminhos que eu ando n√£o s√£o pra atletas 

Ey chamin√© chamin√© cintos da Gucci, casacos de pele
Sou t√£o estiloso pare√ßo um modelo 
Tou sempre no topo tipo a Torre Eiffel 

Ey , Tenho tudo o que eu preciso 
Ey , Drogas sim eu uso isso 
Ey , Sou o mais novo sem ju√≠zo
Ey , Tenho um copo cheio de Whiskey 
Ey , 2 noites sem dormir

Relaxado parece que todos os dias √© Domingo
S√≥ Deus sabe eu n√£o percebo o que o teu nigga quer de mim 
Eu n√£o posso ficar com Tosse eu bebo muita Code√≠na 

Eu n√£o canto o que tu queres ouvir
S√≥ canto sobre aquilo que eu vivo
Garrafa minada me deixou ativo
Eu posso comprar tudo o que eu nunca tive 

Eu fiz uma Santa tornar-se uma Bitch
Tua baby chupou depois do Video Clip
Dormiu no meu Crib 
Semana seguinte
Ela fez o teste mas deu negativo 
Isso √© positivo

Ey, Eu tenho drogas no est√∫dio 
Ey, Dizem que eu roubo e n√£o estudo
Ey, Pedras no copo eu misturo
Ey, Em vez de pouco eu pus tudo 
Ey, S√≥ quero j√≥ias e ouro 
Ey, Eu sou brilhante no escuro 
Ey, Eu tenho a ...
Ey, Eu tenho a Gun e te furo

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

The run immediately became one of the most contentious in the game's history, with the runner getting luck even he himself believed to be in ""one in a million"" territory.

After years of periodic study, and now months of close examination, I've analyzed this legendary run and leave the question up to you... do you think Chuya actually got this World Record?  Or are the combination of questionable factors surrounding the run too much to overlook?

After using it over this last month, I found a few things that I like, and a few things that I did not like. Overall, the system is great, it works well and if you like to keep up with technology in your car, then this is one of the best ways to do it. There are however, much cheaper carplay systems that are available. It really just comes down to each persons preference and how much they are willing to spend.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cNRL7CmaSKk/sddefault.jpg,0.012634514997535486,0.0002799669440044795,45.128595600676825,0.0006212802826766073,0.012914481941539964,0.013535762224216572,2018-03-06,07:01:58,Tuesday,1,13,43,12,38,72,374,4,85,0,1,10,22,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.564997558280952,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'cat': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Floyd Mayeather and Conor Mcgregor last fought on August 26th, 2017 in the T-mobile arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Since Mayweather‚Äôs TKO victory over Conor the two have consistently been trading indirect shots at one another in a continued beef. MMA fans have grown irate with conor due to his lack of title defenses, and specifically, his lightweight title defense. UFC president Dana White had no real answer as to Conor‚Äôs return date and whether he would strip Conor of the title since he hasn‚Äôt defended it since November 12th, 2016. He was asked numerous times to give a direct answer but he evades the topic all together by saying ‚Äúnext question please.‚Äù We‚Äôre approaching 2 years since we‚Äôve last seen conor in the cage and people have been speculating who his next opponent would be. Most have been clamoring for him to step into the cage vs the winner of interim champ Tony Ferguson vs #2 ranked Khabib Nurmagomedov. However, Floyd could be on Conor‚Äôs radar at the moment. There have been numerous hints that a potential rematch vs Floyd could be in the works and the matter is speculative, but, all signs are pointing in the direction of it being feasible and maybe even true. Now, I‚Äôll present some evidence supporting that statement so that you can draw your own conclusion and let me know what you think down below.

We started our Chinese street food tour in the morning bright and early at 6am in the Territy Bazar of Kolkata, India, and found some very special Chinese street foods, like chicken dumplings AKA momo's, meatball soup, chinese street snacks, and lots of other snacks. The BEST part about all the street food was the fact that it was in India! I never expected this!

Here are the addresses for all the street food in this video:

1) Morning indian chinese street food market: Territy Bazar in Kolkata
2) Amazing Wonton Noodles made by local Hakka Chinese Indians:
3) AMAZING Indian Chinese Food AKA Indianized Chinese Food for lunch at Beijing Restaurant at Tangra, Chinatown at AU YUNG,  in a lane near Chinese Kali Mandir,Tangra

Most importantly, EVERYONE really rocked till 4am. It was a fun and loving set, and I can't say enough good things about everyone involved. Hope you enjoy the video!

Description:
WWE chairman Vince McMahon is giving the XFL another go-around. Despite it lasting just one year in 2001, Vinny-Mac is confident it will be successful when he revives the league in 2020.

And you know what? The guy has a right to feel confident this time around. Vince should learn from his mistakes, and he should find a way to make the XFL MUCH more relevant this time around. And oh, the NFL should be a TAD bit worried.

I‚Äôm Justin Fraction, and today we present 10 reasons why the XFL could compete with the NFL!

And a big shout out to John Miller for suggesting this video!

KAMELOT‚Äôs founder Thomas Youngblood states: 
‚ÄúThe Shadow Theory album is a psychological journey through the complexity of the Human Mind. We are subjected to stimuli constantly through media, technology, social experiments and AI. Can we still be social creatures in the near future? The Shadow Theory is an album that is mixing many worlds, giving the listener an Escape within our own realities. This album was written and recorded over the entire year and we are really proud of the song elements and diversity on The Shadow Theory.‚Äù

The Shadow Theory was produced by acclaimed music producer Sascha Paeth and mastered by Jacob Hansen. A massive piece of work that will more than please critics and fans alike. Guests on the album include Lauren Hart (Once Human), Jennifer Haben (Beyond The Black) and Sascha Paeth. The amazing cover and artwork was created by Stefan Heilemann.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cQKrMeeTlfc/sddefault.jpg,0.014165530407706925,0.0003603636433574149,39.30898876404494,0.00032898366317741536,0.014525894051064338,0.014854877714241753,2018-03-03,15:45:29,Saturday,5,9,24,9,22,60,206,4,43,1,0,6,3,0,1,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.225864590857683,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{},0

Monday night, the Department of Homeland Security decided to rescind Temporary Protected Status for 2,500 Nicaraguans currently residing in the U.S. Although the status is supposed to prevent them from being deported during crisis,  in some cases, it‚Äôs allowed people to stay in the U.S. long after the crisis has ended. But with Donald Trump in the White House, those people are wondering how much longer that protection will last.

VICE News examines Trump‚Äôs attempt at solving the world‚Äôs most intractable foreign policy problems during his trip to Asia.

Plus, Republicans push forward with tax reform and Weezer presents this week‚Äôs installment of Music Critic.

Digital media consumption is growing; everything else is shrinking.
Digital advertising is growing; everything else is flat.
It's Google and Facebook, and then everyone else.
Traditional TV has passed its peak, but TV won't die.
The next big thing isn't smartwatches or glasses or even virtual reality.
And much more.

call JW Marriott Dongdaemun and make a reservation. 

I would suggest booking your reservation on weekdays because on weekend you'll be put on a waiting list so that would take time for them to confirm your reservation, so my advice just go on weekdays.

Movies take a staggering amount of money to make, and nowadays, any budget below $50 million is considered mid-to-low range. That level of spending usually works out in the end, since movies also make a staggering amount of money, but not all producers are lucky enough to earn back their investment.  In the case of these films, the films did so poorly at the box office that they're considered cautionary tales in Tinseltown‚Ä¶

FINALLY! The US stock market had the toughest week in 2+ years.

There are VERY few good plays for now...whew! Not only is this healthy price action, but it's also a very good opportunity for many of you http://tim.ly/sykesmc students to watch my archived video lessons/webinars so you can be prepared for when there is a solid trade setup, which any further dipping and/or bounce would create.

This is how I'm preparing for a potential stock market crash 2018.

0:05 The Dow just had it's the toughest week in two years, but we're still up so much. 

0:30 I don't play market guessing games, I take it one trade at a time. 

1:00 Bitcoin is following a very odd pattern. If it doesn't fit my pattern, I do nothing. 

1:45 Bitcoin has been fading the last few days. The good news is that this is healthy. You have to play things safely.

2:20 Be very careful on longs right now. This is the first big drop in a long while.

3:00 I like being safe rather than sorry. We are due for a dip. We are due for a stock market crash. We are due for consolidation. Take it one trade at a time. 

4:00 Learn to have patience when you don't have the right set up. Sometimes the best trade is no trade at all. 

4:30 Cash is king. The best trade for me right now is no trade at all. You don't have to move your cash all of the time.

5:10 The odds are not good enough to play stock market guessing games.

5:30 Don't play guessing games. No one knows what's going to happen to the overall market.

6:15 I don't want to play low odds guessing games. I don't want to gamble. I want to grow my money meticulously.

7:00 If you don't know where the overall market is going you have to be extra careful especially when we're due for a stock market crash.

7:30 No stock matters right now when the overall market isn't strong. Respect the overall market. Be prepared, be ready. Don't be a hero.

8:30 Leave a comment: ""sometimes the best trade is no trade at all.""

9:00 We are all using the exact same strategies and the same rules. You wait for the best opportunity. 

9:30 We all have different personalities, but one thing stays the same: the stock market patterns.

10:00 We have not had a real dip since 2008. 

11:00 It's good to have volatility. I've been rooting for a crash for a while. 

11:30 I miss short selling. I want a stock market crash. 

12:30 When you have this kind of market you have to play defense. 

13:00 Is this the beginning of a bear market? Is this the end of Bitcoin? I don't know.

14:00 I teach what works. I don't teach what's popular. I don't want to lose my mind or my money, and I don't want you to either.

15:00 Guessing games are not the way to long-term success. I will strike when the pattern is predictable. 

15:15 The potential stock market crash gives us time to rest and time to prepare.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUXShOp9axU/sddefault.jpg,0.018939734484102008,0.0009290059636189275,20.387096774193548,0.008151278132398333,0.01986874044772094,0.02802001858011928,2018-02-04,21:44:37,Sunday,6,18,74,17,33,99,527,4,73,2,0,12,0,6,8,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.5666743806780365,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{},0

We blindly agreed that we possessed all the necessary skills to form a production company and, since then, have worked tirelessly to validate ourselves through the approval of our subscribers.

On Fitbit Firmware Modifications and Data Extraction

Security architectures for wearables are challenging. We take a deeper look into the widely-used Fitbit fitness trackers. The Fitbit ecosystem is interesting to analyze, because Fitbit employs security measures such as end-to-end encryption and authentication to protect user data (and the Fitbit business model). Even though this goes beyond security mechanisms offered by other fitness tracker vendors, reverse-engineering the trackers enables us to launch practical attacks against Fitbit. In our talk, we demonstrate new attacks including wireless malware flashing on trackers as well as ‚Äúunlocking‚Äù the trackers to work independent from the Fitbit cloud.

Well before his controversial comment about slavery went viral, he did a sit down interview with Charlamagne Tha God. In his interview he addressed the comments he made about Jay-Z and Beyonce. In 2016, during his Saint Pablo Tour, he called out Jay-Z and he claimed that Beyonce unfairly won the MTV Video of the Year award.
Kanye addressed those statements in his recent interview and he confirmed that his relationship with the Carters is in a better place today. Kanye also opened up about his disappointment with former President Obama.

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture‚Äîfrom the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles‚Äîthrough the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

LYRICS

We don‚Äôt need a conversation
I‚Äôm not here to try to change your mind
Keep my hoodie, you can take it
I‚Äôm just - dropping by to see if you‚Äôre alright
Heard you found yourself a new friend
I‚Äôm not jealous, he‚Äôs just not your type
Did you mean what you were saying
Don‚Äôt have to answer, I‚Äôm just saying

I know we‚Äôve been here before
Maybe a couple of times
But I was stupid for what I did
For making you cry
Took you for granted, what else
I only thought of myself
I got everything I got, except you

I go crazy just thinking bout ya
shoulda coulda woulda love
On the daily just wondering what
I shoulda coulda woulda done
Cause you stood by me through whatever
And I coulda treated you better
I go crazy just thinking bout ya
My shoulda coulda woulda love

ohhh, ohhh
My shoulda coulda woulda love
ohhh, ohhh
My should coulda woulda love

I like it better when you talk less
Got some nerve for you to show up here
Tryna get all up in my head
Boy I thought I made it crystal clear, if ya
Really miss me, who‚Äôs that new chick
Tell me how that‚Äôs supposed to make me feel
How‚Äôd this get so complicated
I didn‚Äôt mean what I was saying

You know I hate to admit
I can‚Äôt get you off my mind
But you were stupid for what I did
One too many times
Took me for granted, what else
You only thought of yourself
And I hate I can‚Äôt get over you

I go crazy just thinking bout ya
shoulda coulda woulda love
On the daily just wondering what
I shoulda coulda woulda done
Cause you stood by me through whatever
And I coulda treated you better
I go crazy just thinking bout ya
My shoulda coulda woulda love

ohhh, ohhh
My shoulda coulda woulda love
ohhh, ohhh
My should coulda woulda love

Shoulda coulda woulda like
Me and here were stupid tight
Said I love you once or twice 
Around 12 - rang the bell
And we had a Mayweather fight
Started bout a week ago
Tears and crying on the phone
Said she heard about me talking to some other chick named so and so
Truth is that‚Äôs a lie
I am  faithful in relationships
Shorty‚Äôs like my high school hallway
Cause she‚Äôs walked through quite a bit
If I really love her like no other gotta let her know
Put a shoulda coulda woulda on the record cause I go

I go crazy just thinking bout ya
shoulda coulda woulda love
On the daily just wondering what
I shoulda coulda woulda done
Cause you stood by me through whatever
And I coulda treated you better
I go crazy just thinking bout ya
My shoulda coulda woulda love

ohhh, ohhh
My shoulda coulda woulda love
ohhh, ohhh
My should coulda woulda love",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ce6RUZy4U1Q/sddefault.jpg,0.010564449699631669,0.0008196366041877411,12.889187288189778,-5.240978350199763e-08,0.011384086303819407,0.011384033894035908,2018-05-08,15:15:05,Tuesday,1,8,76,8,74,52,660,3,187,0,1,5,29,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.755164793252598,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Boosted Mini S unboxing and first impressions! I compared it to my Acton S and S2 hub motor e-boards and the acton s2 actually did much better than expected with acceleration but for me it's all about CONTROL. The acton remote is still really sketch and I'm not a big fan of hub motor boards. ANYWAYS exciting stuff.

Michael Shellenberger is co-founder and Senior Fellow at the Breakthrough Institute, where he was president from 2003 to 2015, and a co-author of the Ecomodernist Manifesto.
Over the last decade, Michael and his colleagues have constructed a new paradigm that views prosperity, cheap energy and nuclear power as the keys to environmental progress. A book he co-wrote (with Ted Nordhaus) in 2007, Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism
to the Politics of Possibility, was called by Wired magazine ‚Äúthe best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson‚Äôs Silent Spring,‚Äù while Time Magazine called him a ‚Äúhero of the environment.‚Äù In the 1990s, he helped protect the last signi cant groves of old-growth redwoods still in private hands and bring about labor improvements to Nike factories in Asia. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprise their roles as Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence. The show is set thirty years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, the series focuses on Johnny Lawrence reopening the Cobra Kai dojo, which causes his rivalry with Daniel LaRusso to be reignited. The show is 10 episodes long and all of them are available to watch now and that‚Äôs just what Kristian Harloff, Josh Macuga and Mark Reilly did. They‚Äôre here to review the entire series and let you know what they enjoyed about it and what they felt was lacking in the show. They explore the acting, storylines and overall character arcs in the show and let you know if this one is worth time taking a nostalgic trip for back to Reseda.

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

First spotted in 2016 on a Palu riverbank in Indonesia, the 13-foot long reptile was recently spotted again, as this footage shows. The Central Sulawesi Natural Resource Conservation Agency is coordinating rescue efforts by trying to lure the crocodile with bait but so far those attempts have been unsuccessful. Rescuers fear that if the tire is not removed soon, it will strangle the crocodile in the next few months because of its growing body.

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

Screenplay by: Justin Haythe
Based upon the book by: Jason Matthews

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ckKCTvip8C0/sddefault.jpg,0.014508381531222431,0.0003594418847825377,40.36363636363637,0.0005718393621540372,0.014867823416004969,0.015439662778159002,2018-02-22,09:35:00,Thursday,3,7,38,7,33,35,334,0,79,0,1,4,14,3,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.3529276979460585,1,['surprised'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"{'tie': 1, 'car': 1, 'person': 1}",3

While there hasn‚Äôt been much experimentation on this subject, scientists do still know some consequences of this dirty decision. So let‚Äôs find out exactly what they are!  

The good news is that it won't kill you. So, there‚Äôs that. The bad news is that you definitely won't be a happy camper in the end or along the way.
Without proper exfoliation, your skin will quickly become either super oily or really dry. And it doesn't matter which one it's gonna be, both imbalances lead to an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria. According to Dr. Carolyn Jacob, the director of Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology, the oiliest parts of your body, such as your armpits, behind your ears, and so on, would slowly collect dirt and pollutants.
Let‚Äôs keep this nasty snowball going. The next major trouble you‚Äôll face is that you'd become way more prone to different types of infections. Since washing your hair and scalp come along with showering, then prepare yourself for some major itching on your head. As for a whole year without washing your face in the shower, your face would be covered in zits! And, of course, where there‚Äôs bacteria and broken skin, there can be infections and health problems, so it‚Äôs not just all about aesthetics here. 
There‚Äôs actually a guy named Rob Greenfield who went a whole year without showering.
According to the experts, there are a couple of tips that you should follow in order to shower the right way. Make sure the water temperature is not too hot because hot water will suck the moisture from your skin by removing a lot of your natural oils. Long showers can dry out your skin as well. Having two or three showers a day will do the same thing, so it's not that great of an idea either. Instead of lathering up your entire body, it's better to just stick to the areas with a bunch of sweat glands, such as your armpits, groin, underneath the breasts, and wherever else you tend to sweat a lot.

SUMMARY
-The first thing you'll notice is the stench, which will show up in just a couple of days.
-After the first month of your shower-free lifestyle, or even earlier, you can expect all kinds of rashes, itching, and irritations to appear on your skin.
-If you accidentally get a cut or scratch and it‚Äôs left unwashed, it‚Äôll basically be an open door for bacteria to enter your body or infect your wound. You‚Äôd be scratching your scalp nonstop.
-The oily sebum on your face would just keep building up along with bacteria. Your pores would get all clogged up with this nasty gunk, and there you go, you‚Äôd have new pimples popping up left and right.
-It'll take at least a week for the skin to return to its normal state.
-Ron says that it made him reconsider a lot of his life choices and that he came out a much happier person in the end.
-Go with lukewarm water. Don‚Äôt shower for longer than 10 minutes. Avoid over-soaping and use moisturizer after.
