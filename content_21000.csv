Plus, Ali Wentworth says she can’t talk to her friends about her sex life. She’s been married to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos for 17 years. Ali says their sex life is still great, but when she tells her friends they get jealous and annoyed. She feels left out at “ladies lunches” because everyone’s complaining about their marriages.

Should Ali stop talking about her sex life, or keep bragging?

Only five years ago Sanjay Dutt was blowing something else. Permanently tripped out on cocaine, smack and scotch. Sanjay's bar room brawls and wild debauched lifestyle made him the hot favorite of gossip queens. Producers wouldn't touch him and friends drifted away - the world had written off Sanjay Dutt.

Sanjay Dutt, Indian actor speaks about drug addiction. He says, ""I don't know I think I saw myself dying. I have got fed up with the idea of hiding, running and people looking down at me and running into the bathwater and I was falling sick so I decided and I said I need help from my family.""

Tanuja, Indian actress speaks about Sanjay Dutt. She says, ""My director used to tell that don't touch him, I was supposed to slap him in one scene but don't touch him, just sort of wave your hand in front of hi. If you touch him, he'll fall."" 

His comeback was straight out of the movies down-and-out actor first film flop surrenders himself to drugs loses a mother to cancer things hit rock bottom. Enter a director makes him relive the pain on screen as the audience fight back the tears a star or superstar is born and behind the scene the loved lawn poet from Sajan and a sensitive lover from Sadak was pumping iron. 

His personal high-tech gym took him from cold turkey to steamy sweat, with a new lead of muscles, Sanjay Dutt bared his talents.

Mark Hamill Childhood
------------------------------------
Mark Hamill is best known for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy - Star Wars (1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) - a role he would reprise in Star Wars: Than Luc Thuc Tinh (2015). Hamill also starred and co-starred in the films Corvette Summer (1978), The Big Red One (1980), and Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014). Hamill's extensive voice acting work includes a long-standing role as the Joker, commencing with Batman: The Animated Series (1992).

Mark Richard Hamill was born in Oakland, California, to Virginia Suzanne (Johnson) and William Thomas Hamill, a captain in the United States Navy. He majored in drama at Los Angeles City College and made his acting debut on The Bill Cosby Show (1969). He played a recurring role (Kent Murray) on the soap opera General Hospital (1963) and co-starred on the comedy series The Texas Wheelers (1974). Robert Englund auditioned for a role in Apocalypse Now (1979) when he walked across the hall where auditions were taking place for George Lucas's Star Wars saga. After watching the auditions for a while, he realized that Hamill, his friend, would be perfect for the role of Luke Skywalker. He suggested to Hamill that he audition for the role; Hamill did, and won the role.

Released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars (1977) was an enormous unexpected success and made a huge impact on the film industry. Hamill also appeared in The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) and later starred in the successful sequels Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). For both of the sequels, Hamill was honored with the Saturn Award for Best Actor given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. He reprised the role of Luke Skywalker for the radio dramatizations of both ""Star Wars"" (1981) and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1983). For the radio dramatization of ""Return of the Jedi"" (1996), the role was played by a different actor.

With the acquisition of Lucasfilm by the Walt Disney Company, it was announced that there would be more Star Wars films, starting with Star Wars: Than Luc Thuc Tinh (2015), which was released on December 18, 2015. Hamill appeared in Star Wars: Than Luc Thuc Tinh (2015) and will continue to star in the current trilogy, alongside fellow Star Wars actors Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, reprising their roles as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, respectively.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QfZ-p2zcA1o/sddefault.jpg,0.011580904492352162,0.00032179633867276887,35.98830409356725,0.0009672708659520656,0.011902700831024932,0.012869971696976996,2017-12-16,05:20:39,Saturday,5,13,64,12,40,68,400,2,55,0,0,9,31,2,14,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.795753075257823,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 4},4

NO!!
These are schemes selling a dream of being a profitable entreprenuer but in reality you just sink further into debt and kiss your friendships goodbye. NEVER join an MLM. There are multiple other things you can do to make money from home. Don't believe the illusion.

These are just my opinions. They are not meant to hurt anyone's feelings. It's a wake up call!

-Profile-
2002年1月17日生、アメリカ合衆国出身。 幼い時からアメリカでダンスを習う。その後韓国に移り、11才の時に「SEVENTEEN」の練習生生活を経て、13才でヒップホップ ユニット「1PUNCH」としてデビュー。そして2017年、Mnetのオーディション番組「プロデュース101シーズン2」に出演して活躍の場を広げた。同年8月、16才（韓国数え年）でミニ アルバム‘SIXTEEN’でソロデビューを果たす。類まれな多才な才能を変幻自在に操り、ソロデビュー後さらに多くの関心を集める。今年16才という若さながらも、目を見張る実力と才能で魅了する男性ソロアーティストとして、唯一無二な存在感を誇示している。

Between Rep. Devin Nunes’ (R-CA) secret memo, allegations of missing text messages, and the panic over a so-called “secret society” in the FBI, the past few weeks of political news coverage have been dominated by Republican pseudoscandals. And while each of these alleged “bombshells” has turned out to be a dud, these stories raise questions about whether GOP politicians are intentionally baiting journalists -- trolling them into covering conspiracy theories in order to raise doubts about the FBI and the ongoing Mueller investigation. 

Read why the Nunes memo was a dud on vox.com: http://bit.ly/2D0tu8t

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

We travel to Monrovia, Liberia where we meet an infamous polyglot who may not know how to speak over fifty languages after all. Then we remind you of some easy-to-forget English rules, like when to use who vs. whom and the true definition of irony. We figure out how to get a word in the dictionary. Then you learn little-known words that describe language. Finally, we head to James Cameron's world of Pandora to get the backstory on Na'vi in the film Avatar.

This is a new type of video for me, so let me know what you think!

We're looking at the first google result for ""how to become a software engineer"", which is a wikihow article apparently. We look at a kind of alarming random medium post about how to become a software developer (spoiler alert: it requires immense dedication). Then, apparently the market is crashing so we look at business insider's 17 tips on how to keep your software engineering job even during a market crash - topical i know.  finally i found this ridiculous video of lifehacks to do if you work at a computer all day.. i can't believe these things exist.

The style was heavily inspired by drew gooden, so check him out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTSRIY3GLFYIpkR2QwyeklA

Remembering Dennis Edwards (in enhanced high-def) on I Can't Get Next To You, Papa Was A Rollin' Stone (0:45), Cloud Nine (2:57), Psychedelic Shack (5:22), Runaway Child, Running Wild (6:36). These most popular Temptations songs featuring Dennis Edwards on lead vocals were recorded during the peak years (1968-1972) of the Motown group's psychedelic soul era.  Dennis Edwards replaced David Ruffin (of the ""classic 5"" period) in 1968 as The Temptations' lead singer. Many consider Dennis Edwards as The Temptations premier vocalist. The Temptations are live in 1983 concert.  

Dennis Edwards remained in the Temptations until being fired by Otis Williams in 1977 just before the group's departure from Motown to Atlantic Records.  He reunited with The Temptations in 1983 for Motown 25. Watch this Pasadena Civic Auditorium, CA concert performance on Cal Vid channel https://youtu.be/BTPDoMZHKgY

College student Ethan has been harassed with anonymous threats, and his sense of self and power has fractured as a result. To prove himself and boost his sense of safety he seeks out shooting lessons from a reclusive ex-militia member and survivalist.

Director Arman Cole's dramatic short grounds an incendiary nexus of topics -- gun culture, mental health and more -- in a compelling coming-of-age story about a young man looking to gain a sense of power in a world that renders him helpless and fearful.

The film's subject matter could easily fall into overbearing and didactic territory, but instead the story is rendered with a subtle, understated sense of direction, grounded in complex, powerful performances. The characters -- played by Tyler Young and Dominic DeVore -- are likable, sympathetic and above all human, with desires and needs that are easily understandable. When the film takes an unexpected turn, it's both surprising but understandable, given the richly intimate acting and insightful writing.

The film delves into timely territory, offering a searing look at a subject that draws intense feelings on both sides of the issue. But by pointing a lens upon today's issues with well-calibrated emotion and powerful storytelling, ""Small Arms"" accomplishes what powerful art does: it puts a mirror up to our society and challenges us to look closer at the world we make with our words and actions.

Primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth. But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry transforms this gentle ape into a raging monster. To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered alpha predators. As these newly created monsters tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.

For nearly five decades, Gene Hackman was a staple of American cinema. During that time, the San Bernardino-born actor won four Golden Globes, two BAFTAs, and two Academy Awards while starring in classic films like Hoosiers, Unforgiven, and Get Shorty, to name just a very few. Since the early 2000s, however, we haven't seen or heard much from the accomplished actor and all-American tough guy. So what's Hackman been up to?

To the casual fan, it may seem like the success of artist Cardi B came completely out of left field. She went from being virtually unknown to being a best-selling artist in no time at all. But if you have been following her on social media, her meteoric rise to the top is no surprise. We will let you know how Cardi B went from being a struggling dancing, to one of the most successful female rap artists of all time. While many women on Love & Hip Hop seemed to just be supporting the men in their lives, Cardi B was focused on her musical career. As soon as she left the show, she dropped her first major hit, “Bodack Yellow” and recently we got to hear her first studio album, “Invasion of Privacy.” What do you think about the unorthodox way that Cardi B has musically evolved over the years? Tell us your thoughts in the comment section and then subscribe for more from TheTalko.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Rob Cameron - Hi John big fan. Do u think it is significant that kylo ren said 'please' to Rey when he asked her to join her? It shows an emotional connection to her that could be his downfall. Enjoy your day.

Jason Fey - After marveling what the movie ""Logan"" did for the Wolverine character, I have to believe there is a similar story about Ben Kenobi that could be told about a person with great power, but beaten down and regretful.  I realize that the Wolverine and Obi-Wan Kenobi are vastly different characters, but the idea of an introspective look at a beloved character seems intriguing to me.

Donovan Ezra - Academy Award nominations got announced this morning (I know you know that, because I watched them live with you on your stream) and The Last Jedi got four Oscar nominations! Do you believe this justifies the love the majority of us have for the movie? Thanks and may the filthy be with you!

Jack Murphy - Hey John, big fan since the AMC days. The new Star Wars Rebels Mid-season trailer dropped and there’s a lot of questions it raised. But the biggest question I had from it is: will we see Ashoka again? Is she connected to that green bird Condor? We saw it follow her in her last scene? Is she dead?

Jamie Bumgarner - Hi John, found your show about a month ago and I love it! Also love the way you teach me and others to treat other people's opinions! All I have seen is the movies, would love to read a cannon Star Wars book, but don't know where to start!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QqYbQhrJJBU/hqdefault.jpg,0.028337498006273595,0.00616726035408581,4.594827586206896,0.008772396193311712,0.034504758360359405,0.04327715455367112,2018-01-23,22:22:32,Tuesday,1,14,24,12,22,78,181,1,37,1,0,12,24,1,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4504854073002935,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Can drinking water when you eat actually do you any harm, or is it just a health myth? Some experts say that eating and drinking at the same time prevents you from losing weight, while others say water dilutes our stomach acid. Let’s find out what drinking simple water as you eat can actually do to you. 
Some people think that drinking water while eating decreases the acidity in the stomach. So if gastric acid gets diluted, it won't be able to digest your food thoroughly enough.
The digestive process starts before you even put the fork in your mouth. When we’re just thinking about our future meal, saliva starts getting secreted in the mouth. In fact, water doesn’t just enter the stomach from a glass, it’s also in the food you eat. For example, oranges, along with raspberries and pineapples, are 87% water. Research showed that some foods can, in fact, decrease acidity levels in the stomach, but they go back to normal really quickly. 
There are lots of advantages to drinking while eating. It helps soften and break down solid food so that your body can absorb the nutrients better. Water also prevents constipation since it softens the stool.
It’s been proven that drinking just 2 cups of water raises both male and female metabolic rates by 30%. And when your metabolism is increased, this gives you a much-needed boost in energy. Water helps with the absorption of nutrients. It dissolves minerals and vitamins, along with other nutrients you get from your food. Water is vital for flushing toxins out of your body through your urine and stool.

SUMMARY
-Some people think that water pushes food that’s still in undigested into the intestines.
-Water, unlike food, doesn't stick around in the stomach for 4 hours. It goes through the chewed food very quickly, moisturizes it, and leaves the stomach way before the food does.
-If the stomach “feels” that it can't digest something, it pumps out more enzymes to increase the acidity of the liquid inside. Even if you drink half a gallon of water, it won't change the acidity.
-Liquid leaves the body faster than solid food, but it doesn't influence the speed of digestion.
-Having something to drink with your meals is harmless and can even do you some good. 
-Water helps regulate your body temperature, lubricates your spinal cord, tissues, and joints. Water boosts your physical performance.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy 6, and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday 5pm and Sunday 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

Falcon Heavy, le lanceur lourd de SpaceX, devrait s'élancer d'ici fin Janvier. Si le lancement est un succès, ça en fera le lanceur le plus puissant en service actuellement.
Celui ci pourrait permettre de soutenir le SLS dans la conquête de Mars, à moindre frais.

The new ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ trailer dropped this morning and John Rocha is here to give you a breakdown of the trailer. Rocha goes scene by scene through the trailer and highlights what you should be noticing and what plot details might be getting teased throughout it. He also points out certain new characters and how they may come into play in the film. He also explores what we see from the Thanos scenes, what his path with the Infinity stones will be and the role Wakanda might be playing in all of it. The film focuses on The Avengers and their allies who must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.

That’s what our crew learned when the unit allowed VICE News to tag along during an undercover mission to buy illegal ivory at an art gallery in Queens, New York.

The ivory trade in the U.S. is estimated to be a $23 billion dollar industry — and New York City is its hub. To discourage this, a 2014 law tightened restrictions by making the sale of undocumented elephant or even mammoth ivory completely illegal. The only sales allowed now are those where the dealer is selling articles that contain less than 20 percent ivory, and that have paperwork showing the items are more than 100 years old. Under any other circumstance, the sale of ivory is a crime.

The new law hasn’t stopped some dealers from trying, however — so the DEC is still conducting undercover operations. During the June mission at the Ro Gallery in Queens, DEC officers dressed as ivory-loving art connoisseurs. For Lieutenant Jesse Paluch, who headed the mission, that meant wearing a large ivory necklace and bracelet, as well as a linen shirt that he joked was designed to keep “a level of GQ.”

“There's always a level of paranoia because you know who you are, so you automatically think that these people are going to know who you are,” he said. “The best thing to do is just hide in plain sight and act normal.”

The mission was successful; Paluch and a fellow officer purchased a statue, which they later authenticated as containing ivory. One month later, with a warrant in hand, the officers returned to raid the gallery. VICE News filmed the bust as well, which led to the seizure of three additional pieces of ivory, worth a total of $36,000, according to the DEC.

The case against the owner of the art gallery is now pending pre-indictment. We spoke to the owner, Robert Rogal, during an “ivory crush” held in Central Park this past August where the DEC publicly destroyed illegal ivory agents had seized.

“A lot of the items that they're confiscating are vintage items that should go to a museum,” Rogal said. On Wednesday, he  also disputed the DEC’s account of the items that were seized at his store, stating that they don’t contain ivory. He added that the statue that was purchased by the DEC officers contained less than 10 percent ivory and was over 100 years old. The case is “costing me my reputation over a ridiculous thing I wasn’t even aware of,” he said.

[ Samuel ]

‘Samuel’ releases his single [Winter Night], which makes this winter warm for you.
As a R&B song made by ‘Brave Brothers’ and producers team ’2CHAMP’, ‘Winter Night’ has a sweet melody harmonized with a warm feeling of Epiano.  You will be impressed especially by its plain lyrics about a boy declaring his love with sincerity, and the song is brought to completion by ‘Samuel’s sensitive, touching voice. You will feel relaxed as well listening to this song, ‘Winter Night’.

Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Ventura County, the San Fernando Valley and several other locations in Southern California are unfortunately experiencing extreme wildfires that have caused serious destruction. Thousands of acres have been burned. To give you some reference of just how large the destruction has spread, CNN reported that the fire is 4x the size of Manhattan. Thousands of residents have evacuated their homes and thankfully gotten to safety including some very familiar faces.
Paris Hilton tweeted - ""This wild fire in LA is terrifying! My house is now being evacuated to get all of my pets out of there safely. Thank you to all the firefighters who are risking their lives to save ours. You are true heroes!"" She also shared a viral video of the flames burning right near the 405 freeway.
Lea Michelle tweeted - ""Praying for everyone in LA...grabbed what I loved most this morning and so grateful to my friends for taking us in.."" Lea is staying with some of her close friends including celebrity stylist Brad Goreski.
Ariana Grande’s family has also evacuated. Her mother Joan Grande tweeted – “For the first time in my life I have had to evacuate my home... my heart is breaking for all the Californians so sadly affected by the fires!” Ariana posted an insta story saying QUOTE - ""Mom and her pups were evacuated this am and are safe. My pups and I are in the clear so far where we are. Praying for the planet and for the people / animals whose homes are being destroyed. Please be safe everybody. Thank you to the brave fighters who are working endlessly to put a stop to this and who are helping people evacuate safely.”
Chelsea Handler wrote – “Just evacuated my house. It’s like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire. Literally and figuratively. Stay safe everyone. Dark times.”
Lionel Ritchie tweeted – “Due to the devastating California Wildfires, and helping family evacuate to a safer place, I unfortunately have to cancel my show tonight. I look forward to returning to the stage this weekend and performing for my fans.”
Chrissy Teigen wrote – “never thought I’d get to actually play what I thought was a hypothetical game of what would you grab if there were a fire. so far all I have is Luna, some limited edition Oreos and my spike tv award.”
Youtuber William Osman posted a video Tuesday morning jokingly giving a house tour in order to try and find some comedic relief in the devastation but it was really sad because his house burned down. He and his wife have set up a GoFundMe page that has already raised over 140k.
Mayor Eric Garcetti has declared a local State of Emergency due to the fact that three of the four major fires burning had 0% containment at the time the percentage was reported by NBC Los Angeles.
Thankfully there are a lot of ways people can help. Although thankfully people have been able to evacuate safely, many animals have been killed and many displaced and left without food so if you want to help the animals that have escaped the fire, the Humane Society of Ventura County is looking for donations which can be made through the Humane Society’s website. Food for horses, goats, donkeys, alpacas, and cats is in high demand. You can also donate to the Los Angeles County Animal Care Foundation. To help people who have lost their homes visit The United Way of Ventura County’s website.
Definitely devastating, and our sincerest thanks goes out to all the firefighters and their families for truly being heroes and putting in overtime to save thousands of lives. From Clevver Headquarters, I’m Drew Dorsey.

Avicii quotes:-

There's always haters, no matter what you're doing - whether they're complaining that everything you do sounds the same, or it's too different - Avicii

It's hard - some people get inspired by a feeling, but I'm mostly inspired by melodies.- Avicii

When did avicii retire?

On March 29, Avicii announced that he was retiring from touring and live events after 2016. Stardom is psychologically and physically difficult for any artist, especially in the fast-paced and oft hedonistic world of dance music, and his retirement is the result of complete overwork.

.


What is the net worth of Avicii?

At the time of his death, Avicii's net worth was $85 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Much of his wealth came from club and festival appearances, for which he earned six figures per performance, Forbes reported. In 2014 alone, Avicii earned $28 million.

Toyota is returning to the 2018 Super Bowl like never before using sports to unite and inspire during three ads in the most-watched television event of the year. The final spot to be released is from the domestic U.S., longtime campaign “Let’s Go Places,” empowering viewers to see what they’re capable of when fans unite through sports. For the first time in the company’s history, Toyota will have three primetime commercials which will be airing in the first quarter, halftime and second half.  
 
Prior to the halftime show and following the Toyota Halftime Report and a throw from NBC Sports anchor Dan Patrick, Toyota’s 60-second ad, “One Team,” features an amusing, light-hearted narrative illustrating how people from diverse backgrounds unite to celebrate the spirit of what brings them together, their shared passion of sports. 
 
“This is an unprecedented opportunity for our team at Toyota to share messages of unity, friendship, diversity and perseverance,” says Ed Laukes, group vice president, Toyota Marketing, Toyota Motor North America. “With the Super Bowl and the Olympics just days apart on NBC, we’re excited to join fans’ enthusiasm for these two world-class events and connect with them by sharing meaningful and inspiring TV spots.”
 
View the 60-second “One Team.” Previously released were Toyota’s 60-second “Good Odds” which celebrates the automaker’s evolution to a mobility company and its eight-year global sponsorship of The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games; and the 30-second spot “Mobility Anthem” highlighting Toyota’s belief that when you are free to move, anything is possible. To view, visit YouTube.com/Toyota. 
 
The “Lets Go Places” TV spot “One Team” was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and directed by veteran filmmaker Ivan Zacharias. The “Start Your Impossible” TV commercials were developed by Toyota’s agencies of record, Saatchi & Saatchi and Dentsu, with “Good Odds” directed by esteemed director Aoife McArdle and “Mobility Anthem” directed by acclaimed director John Hillcoat.

갓 지은 김이 모락모락 나는 밥에 평범하지만 그래도 정성이 들어 간 반찬들을 
조금씩 담아서 함께 먹는 시간은 꽤 즐겁고 든든하기 까지 합니다.

영상속 레시피 정보를 첨부합니다.

냄비밥(2인분량): 쌀2컵(여기서는 160ml X 2컵), 물 320ml
               *물과 쌀은 일대일 비율로 하거나 기호에 따라 조금 적게 하거나
                조금 많게 하거나!!
         쌀을 씻은 후 체에 바쳐 한 번 물기를 빼 준 후 냄비에 쌀을 넣고
         약20분간 불린 후 중불에서 끓이다가 뜨거운 김이 나오기 시작하면
         약불로 바꿔서 10~13분간 끓입니다.
         불을 끄고 10~15분정도 뜸을 들인 후 골고루 섞어 줍니다.

버섯 미소시루: 가츠오부시국물400~500ml(약2컵), 버섯100g, 미소1~1.5Ts
           가츠오부시국물에 버섯을 넣고 버섯이 익으면 미소를 풀어 넣습니다.
           미소시루는 미소를 풀고 난 후에 바로 불에서 내리는 게 맛이 좋습니다.

ISLA NUBLAR SANDBOX + FALLEN KINGDOM DLC - CONFIRMED! | Jurassic World: Evolution BIG Reveal

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

It was approved by 128 countries, with 35 abstaining from the vote and nine countries voting against.
The text says that any decisions regarding the status of the city are ""null and void"" and must be cancelled.
It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution.
Before the vote, the Palestinian foreign minister urged member states to reject ""blackmail and intimidation"".

Colt introduced the Delta Elite in 1987 to take advantage of the hype and publicity surrounding the 10mm Auto cartridge in the Bren Ten pistol. When the Bren Ten became such an ignominious failure, it left Colt in an excellent position as one of the first companies to actually have a viable offering in the caliber. However, the gun never sold particularly well despite its cult following, and it was removed form production in 1996 because of poor sales. It was reintroduced by Coly in 2009 with a few incremental improvements, and remains available today.
 
Mechanically, the Delta Elite is basically identical to the standard Series 80 1911. It has a polymer guide rod and recoil buffer, along with a set of dual nested recoil springs to handle the more powerful cartridge. It was a reasonable reliably and durable pistol in stock form with stock ammunition, but suffered from reputation problems because of owners who enthusiastically tried to load and shoot the most powerful ammunition they could find, in pursuit of maximum power.

About GGMF:

Ten years ago, a great civil war stretched across the galaxy. A brilliant scientist created blueprints for a superweapon that could end the war: The exosuit. That man was the founder of Fortune Industries. When his comrades discovered the exosuit plans, they wasted no time murdering him. He was survived by his only daughter, who they shot and left for dead.

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

But Donald Trump changed decades of US policy last week, by recognising the holy city as Israel's capital. 
That decision set off worldwide protests and condemnation. 
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan called a meeting of The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on Wednesday to discuss a response. 
He said the US decision was illegal and a threat to all humanity. 
But what can the 57-member organisation realistically do to pressure the US?

FAQs:

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame.

After its grand opening back in July of 1955, Disneyland has enamored guests for 63 years and counting. While you explore the park or wait four hours to ride the infamous “It’s a Small World”, we’ve conjured up a list of some of Disneyland’s Hidden Secrets that you can try to spot while you explore the Magic Kingdom. 

Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr

11. Lost Parents Poster
 Another secret on our list at City Hall happens to be right in front of it! At first glance, you’ll notice that the poster has two parents looking concerned for their lost children. If you’re a big Disney fan you will notice right away that those parents belong to Wendy, Michael, and John Darling from Peter Pan. I guess their children could be described as truly “lost” while on their adventures with Peter.

10. The Mercedes Jeep
 One of the fun props you’ll get to see while waiting in line to ride Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye is an old 1937 Mercedes Jeep sitting casually outside. That prop was actually used on set for the film Raiders of the Lost Arc! 

9. Red Carpet Entrance
 Sadly, it’s not really red carpet, but rather red bricks. Walt Disney wanted you to feel like you were walking on the red carpet when you entered the park, so he had them place red brick down specifically at the entrance!

 8. Cast Member Name Tags
 Ever notice how every Cast Member name tag only has their first name and where they’re from…? That’s because Walt Disney didn’t really enjoy being called “Mr. Disney”, and had always insisted on being called Walt. So in 1962, he issued name tags with both the first name and home state or country of the Cast Member. 

7. Route 55
 One of the coolest attractions in Tomorrowland that allows guests to race and drive their own cars, there are many routes as you drive through the course. One Route, titled Route 55, is an homage to the year Disneyland opened, which was in 1955.

6. Swisskapolka
 If you know a lot about Disney, you’ll know that a majority of its rides have been remodeled or repurposed as time went on to keep as up to date as possible with the movies they produced. One of the attractions remodeled was the Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse, which became Tarzan’s Treehouse in 1999. Although gone, this once loved attraction is still around in today. One of the record players hidden away in the treehouse plays the Swisskapolka, which could be heard when the original attraction was debuted in 1962.

5. The Number 77
 As you move through the line for Space Mountain, you’ll notice the reoccurring number 77. That’s because it is a reference to when the attraction first opened back in 1977. 

4. C-3PO and R2-D2
 While you’re waiting for the Star Tours attraction, you’ll see the most beloved characters from the Star Wars franchise sitting in a specific area. What’s cooler than that, those are two actual props from the films, but are now loaded with animatronics to make them move and speak!

3. Dumbo’s Lost Magic Feather
 Located in the line queue for Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin, you can find a poster that asking for help to find Dumbo’s “Lost” Magic Feather, a nod to the film. 

2. WDI Trees in Toon Town
 If you look closely at the trees behind Minnie Mouse’s house in Toon Town, you’ll notice that a few of the trees make out the letters WDI. These letters stand for Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative team behind the creation of the Disney Theme Parks.

Please listen all the way through the video. To this day, doctors do not know what is wrong with me. I have been going through these ""episodes"" my entire life. This is not simply ""passing out;"" my entire body convulses and shakes. My eyes are wide open and sometimes I pee myself. I couldn't even get my drivers license until I was 21. Unlike passing out, my heart rate actually stops completely. I have seen neurological specialists my entire life, testing for epilepsy, seizures, etc. There is no explanation. 

An episode happened this week while I was hooked up to a heart monitor for my check-up at the hospital. In Colombia, the blood pressure machines do not have heart rate monitors, so I had BOTH a blood pressure machine and a pulse finger reader at the same time. Then it happened, in front of Orlin, giving him the biggest scare of his life. He's gone through this before, back in 2017 when I got my haircut, and I convulsed 3 times before falling to the ground. But this time, he saw my heart stop, like a scene from ER. 

Also, in this video, I explain why I got a herpes out break from the stress of everything going on in my life...from the deportation, to wanting to quit YouTube, to haters, to changing my diet, etc. Many of you were very confused on Twitter.

Hello! Happy last week of the month. We are almost 1/12th through our new year already. This is my first vlog of 2018 footage, and it is mainly me happily relaxing in risd’s winter session. for 5-6 weeks, there is a very chill moment for school before the grind is back in February. I am truly cherishing every. Second. Possible. Thank you for spending some of it here, with me. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day, no matter what is in your way. Make it the best you can, for you! You deserve it. 

The love, kindness and support that circulates through our community is incredible. Thank you so much for being a part of it, and making it great. The internet, our society- it is all so capable of turning beauty and good into bitterness and discontent. With a positive perspective, and a love-filled heart, I think we can all be happier this way. I am sending out to you happy thoughts, as I am so blessed to receive them from you all the time, through comments, letters, and messages. I will see you soon.

Yours truly,
Annabelle

* ABOUT SITTING:  It is highly unhealthy to sit for long periods of time.  I always get up and take a short break every 30 minutes.  Note though that even with breaks, it is known that long periods of general inactivity will put your body to sleep and you need to take longer walks/jogs throughout the day to keep up a healthy metabolism. Take care of your back/neck posture as well.

Here we demonstrate how to prepare a ultralight foam from cross linked gelatin, which can be used to keep cells alive for up to a week at room temperature. No incubator, CO2, dry ice or liquid nitrogen required.  The material is easy to make and prepare and the method works for both adherent and suspension cells.

This was filmed while my friend was letting me do the lactose project in his lab. Since filming, he's used this method to ship cells and they survived and were able to be cultured.

1) Comcast Reportedly Considering Topping Disney's Bid For Fox

2) Quentin Tarantino reportedly forced Uma Thurman to drive an unsafe car in Kill Bill

3) Opening This Week 

4) James Mangold to Direct Ford vs. Ferrari Film as ‘Logan’ Follow-Up 

5) Jessica Chastain Cut from Xavier Dolan’s ‘The Death and Life of John F. Donovan’

6)  First Trailer Released for Melissa McCarthy’s Life of the Party

7) Live Twitter Questions

Though fans of Marvel are looking forward to seeing the Fox/Disney merger go through in order to bring the X-Men and Fantastic Four into the MCU, regulatory processes might actually allow another company to step into the mix and disrupt the deal. This according to a new report from CNBC. It states that Comcast could potentially outbid Disney's offer for Fox assets, which would keep the X-Men and Avatar properties away from the Mouse House. 

Uma Thurman finally broke her silence in a sprawling New York Times interview in which she addressed Harvey Weinstein with her own allegations of abuse. And near the end of the article was a short video in which Thurman revealed she was forced by Tarantino to drive a car in Kill Bill, against her wishes. And seen in the video, released with the interview, Thurman loses control and crashes the car, causing injuries. 

OPENING THIS WEEK

AGREE / DISAGREE

Variety reports that Logan director James Mangold has signed on to direct 20th Century Fox’s film about the rivalry between designers at Ford and Ferrari, who were determined to create the world’ fastest racecar. 

Mommy filmmaker Xavier Dolan’s new movie, ‘The Death and Life of John F. Donovan,’ has a new development that has some fans scratching their head. The director took to his Instagram account over the weekend to offer a lengthy explanation about why, unfortunately, Jessica Chastain’s character has now been cut from the movie entirely.

Melissa McCarthy debuted the trailer from her new comedy Life of the Party, yesterday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The movie was inspired by Rodney Dangerfield’s classic comedy, Back to School.

Al principio todo iba normal, con los reporteros y el equipo a bordo del auto; presumiendo las cualidades de su plataforma, montada sobre un Hyundai Genesis. Pero entonces, chocaron de frente y directo contra otro vehículo; sin que el sistema pareciera detectar algún peligro, inmortalizando el momento en video. Según el propio relato de los amigos de a bordo del auto, la prueba de Phantom AI se encontraba en su punto climático, con un viaje por autopista, prácticamente 100 kilómetros por hora. Cuando un camión de carga que iba más adelante de ellos, soltó por accidente un bote de basura; que provocó el frenado inmediato del vehículo que iba frente al Hyundai de Phantom AI. El sistema autónomo no reaccionó, pero el conductor de la compañía sí, aunque no a tiempo; y se estrelló a 32 Km/h contra el inocente conductor de un Nissan Rogue, ajeno a la prueba.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R4pHVNwzFfw/sddefault.jpg,0.01014722770616395,0.00018322817068607336,55.38028169014085,0.00030968141524406767,0.010330455876850024,0.010640137292094093,2018-03-20,08:35:01,Tuesday,1,10,39,10,34,59,347,1,79,0,1,9,18,1,0,5.0,8.0,['Por |'],"['Por', '|']",True,"['por', '|']",2,2,4,1,0,0,0,6.405263094989376,2,"['happy', 'sad']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 3}",4

Anth didn't leave the house for 2 months after losing his half eaten sandwich in Paris.. he felt like he lost a bit of himself in that sandwich. But Conor couldn't stand by and watch his beloved friend fall into an abyss of loneliness, so he called Anth's mother, and asked her what the new hot spanish song is. She told him ""La Macarena""... so he quickly realised she was not in touch with popular culture at all and hung up and did some research of his own.
This was the result.

Vivo has partnered with Synaptics to bring the FS9500, also known as the Clear ID in-display optical fingerprint sensor, to an as-yet-unnamed smartphone due out in Q2, 2018.

For first-gen tech its impressively reliable and fast, even if it is slower than your average capacitive sensor currently on the market. But there's no denying the coolness of unlocking your phone through the display and it brings us one step closer to truly bezel-less phones.

The announcement came from Kensington Palace Monday morning followed by the newly engaged couple stepping out on the palace grounds to pose for photographs. Meghan looked absolutely stunning wearing a white coat while showing off that gorgeous new rock on her finger. The ring was designed personally by Harry and features two diamonds from Princess Diana’s collection that surround the central diamond from Botswana where Harry and Meghan have often vacationed. The royal family has given their blessing as well as Meghan’s parents. Harry followed suit with tradition by asking Meghan’s parents for permission to take their daughter’s hand in marriage and they happily gave their approval. They released a statement saying - “We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry. Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. We wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together.”
Meghan is also the first American to marry into the royal family which marks a huge milestone in the history of the monarchy, especially when you factor in the beautiful  fact that she is of mixed race. Her father is Caucasian and her mother is African American. Real life Princess Tiana? Yes please. Meghan described the proposal saying QUOTE - “It was a cozy night, we were roasting chicken… and it was an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee . I could barely let [Harry] finish proposing. I said, ‘Can I say yes now?’” They posed for their engagement portrait today and revealed further details about the big day.  They will be wed in the spring of next year but the location has yet to be announced. As for titles, If Harry receives dukedom by Queen Elizabeth II on his wedding day, Meghan would then become a Duchess. Some reports believe Harry will receive the title Duke of Sussex or Duke of Clarence, so Meghan could become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex or Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Clarence. Harry is fifth in line to take the throne. And as if the whole thing wasn’t already the epitome of a fairytale, Prince Harry said he knew he was going to marry Meghan from the moment they  met. According to Us Magazine, Harry first fell in love with Meghan because of her philanthropy which of course is something that was a huge part of his mother Princess Diana’s life. 
Meghan is an American actress who recently wrapped her final season of Suits who you also may recognize from Fringe. Meghan did a beautiful spread in Vanity Fair and told the acclaimed magazine QUOTE - ""We're two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception. Nothing about me changed. I'm still the same person that I am, and I've never defined myself by my relationship.""
I for one can’t wait to see the royal photos and watch the royal wedding and just watch all of my Princess Diaries dreams come true. What do you guys think about the royal engagement?

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

Lyrics:
Don't leave me here especially not with her 
You've heard of people getting lost 
And we don't even talk 
Don't drink my fear 
When I've had too much 
You've heard of people getting lost 
I wanna see you in the dark. 

And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new

I say don't let me go
And you say why can't we be friends 
All night I watch it burn 
And you say why can't we be friends 
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes
I need a taxi

This world is pointless 
If you’re not here
This world is pointless 
If we're not self-destructing love. 

And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new

I say don't let me go
And you say why can't we be friends 
All night I watch it burn 
And you say why can't we be friends 
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes
I need a taxi

And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new

I say don't let me go
And you say why can't we be friends 
All night I watch it burn 
And you say why can't we be friends 
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes
I need a taxi

Lyrics:
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
He's coming to town

The footage shows the moments before the collision in Tempe, Arizona, but not the moment of impact.

It also shows the driver's reaction as the car ploughed into 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she was pushing a bicycle across the road.

Ms Herzberg was taken to hospital but later died of her injuries.

It comes as UK trials for driverless vehicles continue in Milton Keynes.

I can't believe it..the ice fishing season in Nor. Illinois is finally coming to a halt. The recent heat wave up north has really cleared off a lot of the snow and has made for some slushy conditions. So GLAD I went out with the dudes to crank on some crappies up shallow, this winter ice season has been a killer run!

1) Early Aquaman Test Screening Yields Positive Reactions

2) Joss Whedon Drops out of Directing Batgirl

3) Mute Interview with Duncan Jones (roll pre-tape interview)

4) Flamin’ Hot Cheetos-Inspired Movie in Works From Fox Searchlight, DeVon Franklin

5) ‘Zorro’ Movie Still a Thing as Kiersey Clemons Joins Jonás Cuarón’s Production

6) Chris Tucker Says Rush Hour 4 is a Go Project for Him

7) Live Twitter Questions

It looks as though there have been some early test screenings from none other than Aquaman and so far, it’s received positive reactions. In an article from ScreenRant.com, matched up with the good folks over at Batman-News.com, Warner Bros. reportedly showed the film to select invitees on its studio lot and the reaction was good – with Batman-News saying they have two sources that “loved” the film and that “there’s tons of action but it’s a very emotional movie as well.”

Over at THR comes the news that Joss Whedon has exited Batgirl, which he was writing and slated to direct. He came on to the property almost a year ago, in March 2017, with hopes of bringing to the big screen a companion to Wonder Woman – which went on to be a massive success.

AGREE / DISAGREE

According to a report from Variety, Fox Searchlight and DeVon Franklin are set to produce the film “Flamin’ Hot” – a movie that will tell the true story of Richard Montanez, the businessman who created the food phenomenon Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.

According to a report from ScreenDaily, Jonás Cuarón’s plan for his Zorro movie re-imagining got some much-needed attention when the trade reported Dope’s Kiersey Clemons has joined Mozart in the Jungle’s Gael Garcia Bernal in the movie entitled simply Z.

In a recent appearance on ESPN’s podcast The Plug (via a report from Planet Aviation) Chris Tucker commented on the long rumored fourth movie in the Rush Hour franchise, stating that he is in fact, anxious to get it off the ground. “It’s happening,” Tucker said.

The first era of our current eon, the Paleozoic Era, is probably the most deceptively fascinating time in Earth’s history. With near constant revolutions in life, punctuated by catastrophic extinctions, it is also one of the most chaotic.

Thanks to Studio 252mya for their illustrations. You can find more of their work here: https://252mya.com/licensing

Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =]

Full disclosure, I have watched a few episodes of House before but this was probably 10 years ago so I decided to go ahead and start this tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( House MD episode 1 ) of the series. I was really curious to see the difference in watching the show now that I am a licensed doctor. The last time I watched the program I was in high school and knew a tenth of the medical knowledge I know now!

Honestly, I love this medical tv show series because I think it allows us to laugh at some of the crazy situations Hugh Laurie gets himself into. Plus It gave an interesting look at what life is like as an infectious disease doctor especially one as highly regarded as Dr. House. Obviously, the way that he practices medicine is not realistic or accurate because we don't break into people's homes nor do we treat them without explaining what we are doing. All in all, I think Dr. House is a must watch tv show if you're into medical dramas just for laughs alone.

I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches House M.D. / Real Doctor Reacts to House M.D. If you want me to continue making this series please like the video and leave me a comment on which show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

You've heard a lot about Blair St.Clair. You saw her mugshot on tabloid. But she is NOT like what was portrayed by the media. She wants you to know the real Blair, and she is here to show you. 

We talked about the details of the incident of DUI and the rumors and mysteries surrounding the TMZ leak. How did Indiana and Indianapolis reacted to this news? Blair also discusses her thoughts on drag, Indianapolis drag scene, and being sober. She really shows herself candidly, and I'm excited to let everyone know more about you. 

One other thing we want to show is a sneak peek at my music video, So Juicy that you'll get a taste later in this episode. Let me know what you think of it. I was pretty sick filming this episode, but HENNY I had a great time with Blair.

I finally sat down to edit it all together and then got the idea to add the original score which really adds a lot to the scenes.  Not all of the soundtrack is included in this due to their respective scenes not being filmed at the time of rehearsal shooting.

The footage and music in this film belongs solely to John G. Avildsen and the respective musical artists credited at the end.   This video is not intended for commercial purposes or monetary gain.   This is intended solely for karate kid fans.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy 6, and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday 5pm and Sunday 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

In this video I went undercover and talked to fans from the perspective of another fan account. I created a fan account by the name of @sashassushi and talked to lots of other fan accounts. Pretending to be a fan account and talking to fans undercover was super fun! Even though it was a fake fan account they were so sweet.

...or why we need 17 billion Volts to make a picture.

Wouldn’t it be awesome to have a microscope which allows scientists to map atomic details of viruses, film chemical reactions, or study the processes in the interior of planets? Well, we’ve just built one in Hamburg. It’s not table-top, though: 1 billion Euro and a 3km long tunnel is needed for such a ‘free electron laser’, also called 4th generation synchrotron light source. I will talk about the basic physics and astonishing facts and figures of the operation and application of these types of particle accelerators.

Most people have heard about particle accelerators, most prominently LHC, at which high energy particles are brought to collision in order to study fundamental physics. However, in fact most major particle accelerators in the world are big x-ray microscopes.

The latest and biggest of these synchrotron radiation sources which was built is the European XFEL. A one billion Euro ‘free electron laser’, based on a superconducting accelerator technology and spread out 3km beneath the city of Hamburg. The produced x-ray pulses allow pictures, for example from proteins, with sub-atomic resolution and an exposure time short enough to enable in-situ studies of chemical reactions.

This talk aims to explain how particle accelerators and in particular light sources work, for what reason we need these big facilities to enable new types of science and why most of modern technology would be inconceivable without them.

✦ NOTES ✦

While there’s no release date yet so I would not encourage waiting up for it all year, Project TL is expected to release within 2018. RIP Lineage Eternal: Twilight Resistance and welcome Project TL. A new competitor for Lost Ark.

Information on whether Project TL will be on PC or mobile:
* Project TLはコンソールもモバイルも最初から念頭に置いて開発している
* スマホではなくPCを基準として開発している

Which translates to: 
* Project TL has developed console and mobile in mind from the beginning 
* We are developing not based on smartphones but PCs

What I understand from this is that they are developing Project TL with both PC and mobile compatibility in mind, but are basing it to be developed mainly as a PC game. (which makes sense since they are using assets from Lineage Eternal)

Lineage 2 Revolution seems to have gotten quite a crowd so far, but from my gameplay, personally, it’s not been all that impressive. I might do a review of it if I advance enough with it, but first I've got Black Desert Mobile, Phantom Chaser and Ashes of Creation coming up.

✦  GAME ✦

New information from a  recent interview with NCSoft (Google translated):

As a company I thought of a way to make the ""Lineage Eternal"" the best, but the game itself stopped it, so I stopped ""Lineage Eternal"" and made it to ""TL""
It was necessary to be seamless to increase freedom
I wanted to create a game with a high degree of freedom in order to provide various interactions to players, so I came to the conclusion that it should be developed in open world
Lineage Eternal processes and writing tools are inherited as they are
We are rapidly developing in the direction to shorten the development period to the utmost
Although the direction of the game changed completely, the development stage did not return to zero
We are making NCSOFT next-generation games by consolidating the technology of all divisions
There is an interaction element that changes the topography that the wizard can freeze the waterfall and ice climb
We are developing not based on smartphones but PCs
It is not a cloud service game
Project TL has developed console and mobile in mind from the beginning
Since simple porting has no meaning, it will be released according to the platform
Project TL is based on class based growth, battle close to hack & slash games
The eternal multi-hero system is abolished. Regular class system with player avatar
Five classes
We are verifying attack speed and range
2018 CBT aims

SUMMARY
- If a person is talking to you and closing their eyes, you should know that they’re trying to hide from the outside world. 
- A few fingers, a palm, or even a fist near the mouth helps us hold back the words we don't want to let out. 
- If you see someone chewing on the earpieces of their glasses, try having a heart-to-heart with them and cheering them up. They’re definitely subconsciously worried about something. 
- Crossed arms are a clear sign that a person is not feeling it today. 
- When a woman wants a man to notice her, she tries to present herself in the best way possible. She straightens her back to emphasize her breasts, and she may also cross her legs. 
- When people like someone and want to get to know them, they usually lean forward. 
- If someone sits back in their chair, they’re showing that they’re tired of the conversation and don't want to keep it going. 
- If a person doesn't swing back and forth but bounces up and down on their toes, it might be a sign that they’re feeling confident. 
- Rubbing the hands together generally means that a person has a positive feeling about something, and they’re hopeful. 
- While you’re shaking hands with someone, if that person takes your wrist with their free hand, they’re showing that they’re trustworthy, friendly, and honest.

While the Young Han Solo movie is currently filming, with a release date set for May 2018, Lucasfilm are already planning the next set of Star Wars films.

The Obi-Wan Kenobi movie was finally announced – a film that is likely to see Ewan McGregor reprise the role. In the news surrounding that project, it was also revealed that other movies centred on big characters are likely on their way.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Lucasfilm is considering movies that focus on Yoda and Boba Fett the bounty hunter, alongside other Star Wars characters. Back in March a source said: “Rest assured, the Boba Fett movie is not dead. As far as I can tell, the movie will most likely not be an origin story.

“It’s not strictly a Boba Fett movie, but a film about an ensemble of bounty hunters on an adventure.

“It sounds as though Fett is just one important component to the movie as opposed to the central character.”

As for Yoda, the famous green alien was over 900-years-old when he died in Return of the Jedi, so there’s plenty of space for a prequel solo outing. Meanwhile he’s next expected to appear as a Force ghost in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which is released this Christmas.

Lyrics:

I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away
To some other place
I’m suddenly there
Way up in the air
Where passenger trains
Catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath
Of beautiful dreams
My heartache, it seems
So terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe
In endless miracles
Do you believe
In the impossible
Do you believe
Sleep is a time machine Do you believe
In curiosity
Do you believe
In what you cannot see Do believe
Life is a lucid dream

And that’s how you study the stars
And that’s how you study the stars
And that’s how you know them by heart
Life is a lucid dream

Such is the path of a dreamer
I find my way by moonlight
My imagination gives me wings And I can go anywhere

Nuclear testing ended over 20 years ago but the legacy of the test areas still remains and will do for hundreds or thousands of years. 8 countries have actively tested nuclear weapons, some in their own backyard if it was big enough like the Soviet Union and the US but they also used others peoples backyards in the Pacific, the British and French did this.

But what happened to the test sites, in this video we look at the US and Soviet test programs and what became of them and the people nearby.

While Queen Elizabeth has been sitting on the throne for as long as many of us can remember, there will come a day when her seat is up for grabs. Although her son, Prince Charles, is next in line, he may abdicate the throne to his eldest son, Prince William. Becoming King would mean a totally new lifestyle for William and his family, and we’ll let you know what to expect in such a situation. From where he’ll be living, to what you should call Kate Middleton, we’ll let you know what will happen if William becomes King. It will shift the current line of succession, and little Prince George will be next in line behind his father. Do you think that Charles would ever abdicate the throne to his son, Prince William? Let us know which of these men you’d expect to see wearing the crown in the comment section, and then click subscribe to see more great videos from TheTalko.

The Star Wars Show debuted a new deleted scene from ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’. The scene is an alternate take of the battle we see between Finn and Captain Phasma on Snoke’s ship, Supremacy. The scene gives Phasma a great character moment and we get the return of an age-old tradition in the trilogies. We also get some more dialogue from Finn to show us his acceptance for his role now in the Resistance.

John Rocha and Mark Reilly watch this scene for the first time and offer their reactions as they watch it. Afterwards, they speculate on if this deleted scene should have been the one in the movie or if elements of it being in the movie would have given the disappointed fans more from Finn and Phasma. Let us know what you thought of this news and what Rocha and Mark had to say about it in the Comments section below.

오늘은 정말 오랜만에 서울을 벗어나 한국의 다양한 지역을 여행하는 게 얼마나 좋은지 다시 한 번 느껴봅니다! 제가 가본 시장 중에 가장 크고 번잡했던 시장에도 가보고 김치 볶음밥의 신세계를 맛보게 해준 현지 맛집도 들러봅니다! 역대급 최애 볶음밥일지도 몰라요...!

주의: 아직 식사 안 하셨다면 좀 견디기 힘드실 수도 있어요.

Today we finally get out of Seoul for the first time in long while, and rediscover why traveling around to different areas in Korea is so amazing! We visit one of the biggest, busiest markets I have ever been to, as well as stopping to eat at a local restaurant that had an entirely new way of cooking Kimchi Fried Rice... and might be my favourite fried rice I have EVER eaten.

WARNING: If you have not eaten before watching this, it is not going to be easy for you.

Hello! Today I am talking about the Dior products I most love! I hope this will act as a ""What to Buy from Dior"" guide! Last year when I worked with Dior they gave me almost all of their beauty line (I literally felt like Cinderella). Since then I have developed absolute obsessions over several of their products! The Lip Reviver balm is absolute magic! I have trouble finding the perfect pink shade and it instantly matches to my coloring! The Lip Addict lipstick is so decadent, comfortable and shiny, unlike many other lipsticks I've tried in the past. The Diorshow mascaras are best sellers for a reason! The Pump n Volume is as amazing as the rest of the line! As for skincare, the Hydra Life balm has been the highlight of my mornings as of late! It's so dreamy and hydrating- as the name would imply. Lastly, the Capture Totale is an amazing, thick, hydrating moisturizer and I use to seal in my other beauty products! All products are courtesy of Dior, but this is not a sponsored video and as always my views are true and my own. Dior has a new line out and I cannot wait to try it out!

These are short actors and surprisingly short celebrities and the world’s shortest actors!


8. Michael J. Fox - This Canadian-born actor has been on the scene since 1973. However, the role that truly jump-started his career was his portrayal of Marty McFly in the 1985 film, Back to the Future. He’s known for other work as well including a couple of television shows, like Spin City from 1996 to 2001 and The Good Wife from 2010 to 2016. It’s safe to say Michael J. Fox has made a big impact even if he doesn’t measure up to most men physically. This award-winning star is just under 5’5”, but that hasn’t stopped him from taking home four Golden Globes and five Primetime Emmys throughout his career so far. Although Fox can’t travel back in time in real life, there’s no need since he’ll continue to accomplish great things in the future. 

7. Kevin Hart - Although this comedian began his career on stage doing stand-up, he has prospered in the field of acting, while continuing his live performances. Kevin Hart had a rough introduction to the entertainment industry, similar to most people who are just starting out. He was reportedly unpopular during his first appearance at The Laff House in his hometown. After continuing his efforts in spite of initial defeat, Hart was cast in television movies and series, like North Hollywood in 2001 and Undeclared from 2002 to 2003. He went on to take roles in bigger-name films like Ride Along in 2014 to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle just last year. He’s known for all of these achievements, but people also recognize him as being somewhat shorter than most. Hart stands at 5’4”, and has even included his compactness in some of his stand-up routines over the years. This actor may have trouble reaching the top of the fridge, but he has no problem attaining new heights in his career. 

6. Seth Green - A huge deal in the world of comedy, this actor is ahead of the curve when it comes to making people laugh. Seth Green has played in movies like Without a Paddle in 2004 and Dear Dictator just recently. He’s also well-known for his ongoing work in television series including Robot Chicken and Family Guy, and has taken home several awards for the former. Although he’s reached new heights through his career, Green only stands at 5’4”. But, what this actor doesn’t have regarding tallness, he makes up for in comedic genius",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RU2EJlHeocg/sddefault.jpg,0.005808103829801341,0.0007442461813872152,7.804008908685969,0.0016028642703818199,0.006552350011188556,0.008155214281570377,2018-06-02,12:00:04,Saturday,5,6,65,6,48,32,539,1,88,1,0,4,0,2,6,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.68719189128584,2,"['scared', 'happy']",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

These are the top things about this winner of America's Got Talent pop star that you didn't know!


#22. “Inspiration”-Ukulele is not necessarily a popular instrument among twelve-year olds. Grace first fell in love with the tiny guitar commonly associated with Hawaii when she saw the lead-singer of one of her favorite bands Twenty-One Pilots use one in his cover of Elvis Presley’s song ‘Can’t Help Falling In Love’ on Youtube. Shortly after she began teaching herself to play the ukulele using Youtube videos and quickly perfected playing the unique instrument.


#21. “Kiddie Komposer”- Grace was always a music lover and started learning instruments early on but at first she was quite intimidated by the idea of writing her own music. But at the age of ten she overcame her fears and started composing her own songs. She realized that the best songs are those that come from the heart and it’s easiest to write about things you know.

#20. “Avid Collector”- Grace bought her first Ukulele using money from her 11th birthday and even before becoming a millionaire she had amassed a modest collection of cool Ukuleles. She now has five different ukuleles, some of which are for performing and some are just just for playing and writing with at home.When asked why she doesn’t play the guitar she has said that she feels like ukulele comes more naturally to her than guitar and that it doesn’t hurt her fingers when she plays like guitars do.

#19. “Multi-Talented”- Other than mastering the four-stringed mini-guitar she also is quite adept at playing other instruments. Two of the instruments other than ukulele that she is best at are the Saxophone and piano. Her fans can probably look forward to her using these instruments more in her music as she grows and branches out.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RW3hzKkW5Fg/sddefault.jpg,0.015034501667961431,0.001096741763012384,13.708333333333336,0.002924644701366357,0.016131243430973816,0.019055888132340174,2018-05-03,12:30:01,Thursday,3,8,67,8,43,49,543,2,79,0,0,6,0,3,7,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.727732408091142,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Rix Top 6 Must Do Harry Potter Things to do at Universal Studios Orlando.  Truth about me...I love to watch youtube videos that are Top 10's, Top 5""s, etc...so I had to do this one. But maybe 6 wasn't enough this time, just because it rhymes....so maybe I added a couple of bonus items to this list so you have to watch until the end. 

And let us know in the comments what you think of our list, is there anything you would take off.  If so what would you put in it's place.

So there are tons of things to do at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure if you love Harry Potter.  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter has the Forbidden Journey Ride, butter beer, the 3 Broomsticks restaurant, interactive wand spots, etc.  And Diagon Alley also has interactive wand spots, butter beer, escape from gringotts and knockturn alley. And in between the two Harry Potter areas of Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley you can take the Hogwarts Express. Another favorite of Hogsmeade is a visit to Honey Dukes for some every flavor beans. 

So kick back and enjoy the ride. #HarryPotter #WizardingWorld

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

When the Teen Titans go to the big screen, they go big!  “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” finds our egocentric, wildly satirical Super Heroes in their first feature film extravaganza—a fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the superhero genre, complete with musical numbers. 

It seems to the Teens that all the major superheroes out there are starring in their own movies—everyone but the Teen Titans, that is!  But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick.  If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them.  With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.  But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously Super-Villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry.  The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line! 

Will Arnett (“The LEGO® Batman Movie”) and Kristen Bell (“Frozen”) lend their voices to the first-ever big-screen version of DC Entertainment and Cartoon Network’s animated TV show, which also stars Greg Cipes (TV’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”) as Beast Boy, Scott Menville (TV’s “Spider-Man”) as Robin, Khary Payton (“The Walking Dead”) as Cyborg, Tara Strong (the “My Little Pony” franchise) as Raven, and Hynden Walch (TV’s “Adventure Time with Finn & Jake”) as Starfire, reprising their roles from the series. 

The film is being directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath, based on characters from DC. Michail, Will Arnett, Jed Weitzman, and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers. Apart from Arnett and Weitzman, all are “Teen Titans GO!” series contributors. 

Set to release on July 27, 2018, “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R_7PPjnm7_k/sddefault.jpg,0.017847318680720103,0.008630879429147262,2.0678447459766494,1.3617670288966965e-05,0.026478198109867363,0.02649181578015633,2018-01-10,18:05:13,Wednesday,2,10,57,10,41,55,427,2,97,1,3,6,1,2,2,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.745491503611246,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Pegg offered his thoughts on how being a part of creating ‘Star Wars: A Force Awakens’ took away some of his joy as a fan because he knew what was coming in the movie. But the big reveal was when he talked about his reaction to ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’. Pegg stated that, “Well I know what J.J. kind of intended, or at least what was sort of being chucked around. I think that’s kind of been undone slightly by [The Last Jedi]. I don’t know. I don’t know (laughs). I think Unkar Plutt is Rey’s real father.” He also went on to comment that he doesn’t know if Rey’s parentage has actually been decided.

Jedi Council’s Kristian Harloff and Mark Reilly sit down to discuss this news and offer their unfiltered thoughts on what they think Pegg is actually saying about his thoughts on The Last Jedi. They also talk about if this is further proof that there is not one singular vision or voice on this trilogy.

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

****************** About the Video *******************

We hadn't done mail time in a while, and not because we don't love you, but we just felt like not every item deserved it's own video.  Thanks for waiting, and if you still haven't seen your item, just wait, we'll be doing a second video soon.  We had some pretty cool things, a 2,500 psi valve, a pocket watch, and ipod, a motorcycle and a car stereo.  We've got some great things planned for the future, so subscribe.

I have always loved the ingenuity of the Impossible Dovetail Box, how it looks impossible to make and impossible to get apart, until you discover the secret.  We cut one in half with our 60,000 psi waterjet and found out how it worked.

So what's the deal with Mitchell's haircut fail? https://youtu.be/t4dDopgozm4

Mitchell is wanting to start a segment where he reads mean comments, but we don't get too many of them.... so be meaner.

There have been numerous rumors since the film dropped last Fall that Chastain was in consideration for the role. In fact, the rumors even went so far as to claim that the final panel after the end credits would be a shot of the adult cast teasing the sequel with Chastain leading the cast. Variety also confirmed that director Andy Muschietti will be back for the sequel and that Gary Dauberman will write the script.

Perri Nemiroff and Mark Reilly are here to give you their thoughts on this news and on the possible confirmation that Muschietti is back to direct the sequel.

A worst case scenario could be the contacts arcing when open with a high inductive load, and the risk of fire.
I was expecting this remote control socket to be terrible inside, but I was wrong.  Note that this unit lacks an important safety feature often found in other similar units.  A thermal fuse mounted on the relay that kills power if the relay contacts start burning.
Note that it also has a pointless non functioning earth connection and should not be used for high current loads.
To program a remote use the button on the switch to turn it on (LED lit.) and then hold the button in until the LED has gone off and then on again.  When you release the button the LED should flash and that's when you should point a standard infrared remote at the unit and press the button you want to use.

Re0eMGxElRc,FrK2j4cPxSc,Travel Tips From The CEO Of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,Business Insider,19.0,2017-11-21 00:00:01+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'KLM Royal Dutch Airlines', 'CEO', 'Pieter Elbers', 'Flying', 'Flights', 'Travel', 'Airlines', 'Travel hacks', 'Packing', 'Packing tips', 'Transportation']",30298.0,437.0,31.0,35.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Re0eMGxElRc/default.jpg,"We spoke to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines CEO Pieter Elbers to find out his best travel hacks and tips. Following is a transcript of the video.

Pieter Elbers: Well, beating jet-lag for me is an early morning run. So, wherever I go, I wake up early, I do my run, and that's, for me, the way to beat the jet lag. Well, being in New York now it's — there's no better place to run in the morning than in Central Park. So that's what I do.

For the rest, traveling and going around is just great. I love to board the aircraft in Amsterdam and 10 hours later to be in São Paulo or be in LA or be in Shanghai, China.

Everything is in a fixed place. Everything is packed in the same way. I’m boarding an aircraft about every other week, so I want to make sure I don't forget anything. I need everything to be done in the very same way. I know where everything is packed, I know the sequence of packing it. So yes, I do it in the same very structured way.

Business Insider: Do you use any apps or anything to help you remember things?

Elbers: No, by the time I need an app to remember what I need to pack, I should be out of a job, right? No — what I do is I have a special bag for sort of my running stuff and some of the non-business related items. And then I have a small carry-on luggage for business shirts, ties, and so-on.

Well, it’s definitely not Tuesday afternoon. So, prices are changing all the time according to the season, according to the demand, according to the specific circumstances. So, I wouldn’t be able to give you a sort of specific time of the year, time of the moment. Obviously outside the holiday period, it’s — pricing is different than within the holiday period which is a bit similar I guess to hotels and all kinds of other businesses.

Well, sometimes we do have overbooking situations, and in that case of course, we try to find our most loyal customers and try to reward them for their loyalty — even if they fly coach — to have them upgraded. So I guess, the answer to your question is, to be a loyal customer on KLM and you’ll have the most the chance to be upgraded.

ABOUT NIKA:
Daughter of two Slovenian faces in the entertainment industry Janja Pušl and Zoran Kljun, owner of the largest dance school in Slovenia called Bolero, Nika was destined to stardom. Her passion for dance and love for the stage began at her parents' dance school, Bolero. There, she nurtured her talent and followed in her family's footsteps competing as an undefeated champion. Dancing professionally since the age of three, Nika trained in jazz, tap, latin, ballroom, funk, and ended up finding her deep love for hip-hop and the freedom it gave her to express herself as an artist. She wanted to share her passion for hip hop and became a mentor for the Bolero dancers, encouraging them to follow their dreams while bringing them to multiple wins from all over Europe.

After many wins, including taking gold (1st place) as a soloist at the at the world championships and being asked to be the global spokesperson for Nike, Nika was given the prestige title of Slovenian Ambassador of Dance. She took over Europe as a professional dancer and choreographer, and that sparked an even bigger dream. Nika wanted to grow and continue moving forward and proof that anything is possible.

Nika now lives in Los Angeles, California. She has worked on major projects with stars such as Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Ne-yo, Pitbull, T-Pain, One Direction, Cher Lloyd, the Britney Spears tribute on MTV Video Music Awards, Jessica Sanchez, Donna Summer, Kaya Jones, Gina Katon, Matt Pokora, Herb Alpred, Macy’s Glamorama Fashion Tour, Monsters of Hip Hop, Billboard Music Awards, Young Hollywood Awards, NRJ Music Awards, X-Factor USA, UK & France, America’s Got Talent, The Voice, Move Live on Tour and was a part of Justin Bieber’s promo tour.

""When Sen.-elect Doug Jones, D-Ala., addressed his cheering supporters Tuesday night in Birmingham, Ala., one of his first shout-outs went to his African-American supporters. As well it should have.

Black voters made up 29 percent of the electorate in Alabama's special Senate election, according to on exit polling. That percentage is slightly more than the percentage of Black voters in the state who turned out for Barack Obama in 2012. And a full 96 percent of Black voters in Alabama Tuesday supported Jones, including 98 percent of African-American women. ""Black women led us to victory.

The marriage of Orpheus, the greatest of all poets and musicians, to Eurydice, a wood nymph, was heralded as the perfect union. Anyone could tell the couple was deeply in love. So when their wedding ceremony ended in Eurydice's untimely death, Orpheus had no choice but to venture into the underworld to try to reclaim his lost love. Brendan Pelsue shares the tragic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.

Moderated by Sara Vilkomerson, Entertainment Weekly.

GRETA GERWIG has rapidly emerged as one of Hollywood’s most engaging actresses, screenwriters, and directors, most recently writing and directing LADY BIRD.  The film has appeared on over 200 “Top Ten” lists for 2017, and has won Best Picture from the New York Film Critics Circle and Gerwig has won Best Director from the National Board of Review.  The film is nominated for three Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Gerwig was last seen in 20th CENTURY WOMEN alongside Annette Bening and Elle Fanning from director Mike Mills. Gerwig received a Critics’ Choice Award nomination in the category of “Best Supporting Actress” for her portrayal of “Abbie,” a photographer who is being treated for cervical cancer. Last year, Gerwig also starred in Pablo Larrain’s JACKIE alongside Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard; Todd Solondz’s WIENER-DOG opposite Danny DeVito, Ellen Burstyn, and Kieran Culkan; and Rebecca Miller’s romantic dramedy MAGGIE’S PLAN opposite Ethan Hawke and Julianne Moore. 

In 2015, Gerwig starred in MISTRESS AMERICA, a comedy that she co-wrote with director Noah Baumbach, which premiered to rave reviews at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Gerwig’s previous collaboration with Baumbach, FRANCES HA, earned her Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award nominations in the category of “Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy.” The film, which also earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for “Best Feature,” premiered at the 2012 Telluride Film Festival, Toronto Film Festival, and New York Film Festival.

Gerwig first received critical acclaim for her breakout role as “Florence” in GREENBERG, which marked her first collaboration with writer/director Noah Baumbach. In the film, she starred opposite Ben Stiller and her performance earned her several nominations including a Gotham Award nomination for “Breakthrough Performance” and an Independent Spirit Award nomination for “Best Female Lead.” 

Other film credits include Barry Levinson’s THE HUMBLING opposite Al Pacino and Dianne Wiest, Woody Allen’s TO ROME WITH LOVE opposite Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page; ARTHUR opposite Russell Brand and Helen Mirren; the romantic comedy NO STRINGS ATTACHED with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher; Whit Stillman’s comedy DAMSELS IN DISTRESS; and Fox Searchlight’s LOLA VERSUS. A darling of the independent film scene, Gerwig’s prior credits include Ti West’s “art-house horror film” HOUSE OF THE DEVIL; the Duplass brothers’ genre-bender BAGHEAD; Joe Swanberg’s HANNAH TAKES THE STAIRS as a writer and actress, and NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS which she co-wrote and co-directed.

Gerwig graduated Magna Cum Laude from Barnard College and currently resides in New York City.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ri9_RnpaMYU/sddefault.jpg,0.016092482511740943,0.00026273440835495416,61.25,0.0006896778219317548,0.016355216920095898,0.017044894742027653,2018-01-18,22:27:28,Thursday,3,4,14,4,13,31,144,0,36,0,3,3,12,1,0,7.0,9.0,"['SCA a', '', 'FOUNDATION']","['SCA', 'a', 'FOUNDATION']",True,"['sca', 'a', 'foundat']",3,3,11,0,0,0,1,5.787198543514182,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Lyrics

I won’t let you down

i wish that we could just talk
but i don’t really know where to start
ye you got every right to be mad
after all of the things that i said
i know i didn’t deal with things properly
but know I’m trying be the man I’m supposed to be
if i don’t then ill live in regret
cos i hate that i left you upset

threw your keys on the table
said that i was ungrateful
and i thought i was strong ohhh

i know i hurt you
never said i loved you
but ill say it now
and you should know that
I’m not gonna hold back
this time around
if you give me another chance
i won’t let you down

i know i messed up
but to tell you the truth
i was too busy hanging out with my crew
you were so cool and it aint no excuse
i shoulda spent a little time with you
instead of just playing around messing about
but i was in the drivers seat but who’s the passenger now
sat here trying figure it out
same song going round and round

threw your keys on the table
said that i was ungrateful
and i thought i was strong ohhh

i know i hurt you
never said i loved you
but ill say it now
and you should know that
I’m not gonna hold back
this time around
if you give me another chance
i won’t let you down

there are some things that we cannot change
no we can’t go back in time
but i hope that it isn’t to late
to give it another try

i know i hurt you
never said i loved you
but ill say it now
and you should know that
I’m not gonna hold back
this time around
if you give me another chance
i won’t let you down",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RizIubXJQyk/sddefault.jpg,0.017856743140952088,0.00027082396213083725,65.9348714953271,0.0006061900834610796,0.018127567103082925,0.018733757186544003,2017-11-22,20:00:02,Wednesday,2,9,76,9,49,44,509,4,97,2,4,6,5,4,8,4.0,6.0,['vevo'],['vevo'],True,['vevo'],1,1,4,0,0,0,0,4.608317358931523,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

A lot of you asked why I don't teach beginner classes anymore so I'm going to try to do one each month! This might be a little challenging if you're a brand new beginner, but I promise if you spend 30 minutes a day for a week practicing with the tutorial, ANYBODY can learn this dance!

As you keep doing the tutorials you'll notice you get faster each time until you can remember the routine after watching it just once.  Make sure you follow us @EpicDanceVideos on instagram to join our amazing dancers who support each other online from all over the world.  I'm dedicating more time than ever to training, choreographing and making tutorials for you guys this year.  If you truly want to get better, set a goal NOW to train with me every day (pick an amount of time that you can really commit to per week) and let's see how far we can go together this year!

Dragon's beard, also know as pulled cotton candy, also known as other stuff too, is a surprisingly fun process of pulling soft candy.  Both of us enjoyed this project so much it has inspired us to do noodle pulling and create our own pasta from scratch.

--
그 어디에서도 보여준 적 없었던 BTS의 아주 솔직한 속 깊은 대화.

남미에서의 투어가 계속되면서 정신적으로, 체력적으로 지쳐가지만 서로에 대한 신뢰와 의지를 통해 힘든 상황을 극복해 가는 BTS의 모습이 그려진다. 칠레에서의 세 번째 공연을 마친 멤버들이 한 자리에 모여 가진 조촐한 치맥파티. 연습생 시절, 데뷔 초창기를 회상하며, 처음 만났을 때 가졌던 첫 인상과, 그 때의 복잡한 감정들이 솔직하게 오고간다.

LYRICS

We were so beautiful We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself, seventeen
Then you came found me
No other magic
Could ever compare
There’s a room
In my heart with the memories we made took em down but they’re Still in their frames
There’s no way I could ever forget
Mmm

For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
I will never not think about you
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one
And no matter what ever I do
I will never not think about you

What we had only comes
Once in a lifetime
For the rest of mine
I’ll always compare
To the room
In my heart with the memories we made
Nights on 5th, in between B and A
There’s no way I could ever forget

For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
I will never not think about you
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one
And no matter what ever I do
I will never not think about you

Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun? Looking back
Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun? Looking back
Didn't we have fun? Didn't we have fun?
We were so beautiful We were so tragic
No other magic
Could ever compare

This is the first video I've made for my spring break trip that Tyler and I took to the Caribbean. I made this more of a journal/diary format, because I focused a lot on what I wanted to cherish and remember from this trip. It was so great! Thank you for all the sweet words wishing us fun and a safe trip. This was Tyler's first cruise, and it was amazing for the both of us! Looking forward to editing the rest of the trip.

I hope that your April has been going well, we are already almost halfway through. The next week for me is going to be one where I am going to need to HUSTLE. and it kind of scares me.. but in a way, since we cannot control time and it will inevitably tick away, it's kind of reassuring to also know that I am going to have to do everything and there's nothing I can do about it :P just a lot of work, some midterms and other deadlines all overlapping. As a matter of fact, last night after class got me so stressed out, I sat in studio for two hours just ""trying"" to work out how I am going to approach my work, on the verge of frustration tears, skipped dinner- and honestly, it didn't get anything done. But today is another chance to wake up, learn from yesterday, and put in my best!

 Last night I also baked cookies way later than my bedtime and walked to my friends' rooms to give it to them. And it brought me so much joy! And this is also a new cookie recipe I used, and its soo moist. Have to make it another time on the vlog. For the moment, I haven't been vlogging everyday here at school, one because busy! and two because of all the footage backed up from spring vacation footage.

Anyway, I really went on a huge tangent there. I hope that you are taking care of yourself, putting health and safety as your priority, and surrounding yourself with positivity and love. I will see you soon.

Love,
Annabelle

Every year, the world uses 35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel dependence pollutes the earth, and it won’t last forever. On the other hand, we have abundant sun, water and wind, which are all renewable energy sources. So why don’t we exchange our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based only on renewables? Federico Rosei and Renzo Rosei describe the challenges.

Lyrics:

Hell raising hair raising
Im ready for the worst
Soul frightening face whitening
Fear that you can’t reverse

My phone has no signal
It’s making my skin crawl
This silence is so loud
The lights spark & flicker
With monsters much bigger
Than I can control now

Welcome to the Panic Room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna come for you (come for you)
Welcome to the Panic Room
You'll know I wasn’t joking when you see them too (see them too)
Welcome to the panic room


Still waiting hands shaking
Maybe the coast will clear
But these voices these strange noises
They followed me in here

My phone has no signal
It’s makin’ my skin crawl
This silence is so loud
The lights spark & flicker
With monsters much bigger
Than I can control now

Welcome to the Panic Room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna come for you (come for you)
Welcome to the Panic Room
You'll know I wasn’t joking when you see them too (see them too)
Welcome to the panic room


Theres no Cryin’ wolves now
Cos the truth has settled in
Hidin’ under goosedown
For your nightmare to begin


Welcome to the Panic Room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna come for you (come for you)
Welcome to the Panic Room
You'll know I wasn’t joking when you see them too (see them too)
Welcome to the panic room

I have always used dual screens on my computer setup, so why not include a second smartphone display!?

What do you think? Would you ever buy a dual screen smartphone? What would you change to make it more practical?

As what you've probably noticed, many shots from the two trailers of Thor: Ragnarok have been obviously changed in the final film. Some changes were due to special effects being in various stages of completion, or to shots being from different takes, or to the reshoot of a few scenes. Some of the shots from the trailers were intentionally altered by Marvel in order to avoid spoilers, and some shots were deleted in the final film because... well, who knows.

I put some screenshots from the key moments with obvious changes at the end of the video, so that you can pause and take a closer look in case the trailers play too fast for you, or you can also play 'Spot the Difference' with them if you're just as bored as me.

ENJOY! :-)

And btw, if you're reading this before watching the video, spoilers.

FURTHER READING

“‘The Inner Idiot’ is a bracing term used to describe a substantial, hugely influential and strenuously concealed part of everyone. An Idiot is what we deeply fear being, it is what we suspect in our darkest hours that we might be – and it is what we should simply accept, with humour and good grace, that we often truly are. A decent life isn’t one in which we foolishly believe we can slay or evade The Inner Idiot; it’s one in which we practice the only art available to us: sensible cohabitation…”

If you are buying a Mavic, you want to make sure you get the one with the features and capabilities that best suit your needs. The Mavic Pro is proven to be an amazing drone that takes 4K video and can travel pretty easily with you on just about any video shoot or adventure. The Mavic Air is even smaller and has many of the same capabilities. However, the Mavic Air does give up some things in exchange for it's amazingly small size. This video outlines the advantages and disadvantages of both these DJI quadcopters and gives you a good understanding of which might be the best fit for your needs. We use thirteen objective criteria to compare both drones and make recommendations based on the results!

Please comment below on your thoughts about the two Mavics!

The central defender, who was called up into the FC Barcelona squad for the first time to face Betis, faces a series of questions about football.

With a smile, he tells us about his preferences. Rivaldo or Ronaldinho? Asprilla or Valderrama? He also answers a question about the stadium he most wants to play at. A clue: He has very good memories of this venue and gave a wink to Barça's history in European competition.

Yes, as always, Ajit Pai, the passionate advocate for a ‘free and open’ internet, is back, and ready to repeal those regulations that have affected the consumers so badly, he’s really a knight in shining armour to those who have suffered. And when I say those who have suffered, I mean the poor, poor cable companies. My heart has really weeped for them over the last few years, as I have had to watch them endure, so much.

Now I covered many arguments back in my first video, which was very aptly titled ‘Don’t Forget About Net Neutrality’, it appears that I haven’t, and here I am, ready to argue against the new points that have appeared to sprout out of the malnourished, deprived soil.

Seeing John Collins' mother cheering her son on arose within me some weird (no, not in that way you perv) emotions. Sadness. Confusion. Regret. The only thing she knows about my internet activities is that I tried to be an Instagram model for a bit, and she wasn't super encouraging about that.

Also I think she saw the edge of my pink starfish in one of my pics.

She definitely doesn't know about the highlight empire I'm running, and even if she did, she'd wonder why I'm wasting my time making videos of marginal NBA players when I could be showcasing LeBron and Durant. Uh, excuse me, those dudes are lame. I am creating TRUE ART of UNHERALDED ROLE PLAYERS.

Like Collins here. He's great, because he dunks it a lot, but in this game, he expanded his game. No dunks. One dunk attempt that turned into a semi-thrunk. A whole bunch of three-pointers.

In the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic games, we can almost certainly expect to see a lot of falls and possibly injuries due to the difficulty of these jumps.

After first finding American fame on the goofy '90s sitcom Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place, Ryan Reynolds moved on to play leading roles in multiple romantic comedies as well as action flicks like Blade: Trinity, Green Lantern, and—of course—Deadpool, the role he was born to play. Reynolds always brings a playful edge and sharp sense of humor to his roles, which can lead to a lot of extra footage and hilarious outtakes. Here are some of Ryan Reynolds' best bloopers...

Modems, FIDO, Z-Netz, Usenet, UUCP, SLIP and ISDN

This talk explains how individuals were able to communicate globally in the 1990ies using self-organized networks of BBSsin networks like FIDO and Z-Netz, before individual access to the Internet was possible.  It also covers the efforts of non-profit organizations to provide individual access to Internet Mail+News via UUCP and later via IP during that period.

This talk covers how individuals could participate in local, regional and global message-based data communications in the 1990ies.  It covers the technologies used to access such networks, both on the infrastructure (BBS) side, as well as on the user/client side. 

At the same time, the talk is a bit of a personal journey from 

accessing dial-up BBSs using accoustinc coupler and modem
becoming CoSysop of a BBS and learning about how to operatie BBSs
being a Node/Point in message based communications networks like Z-Netz and FIDO
using UUCP to participate in Internet mail/news (Usenet)
working in the technical team of Kommunikationsnetz Franken e.V. to set up a community-based ISP with modem and ISDN dial-up banks, satellite based Usenet feeds, analog leased lines ISDN-SPV.
helping getting Germany's alleged first Internet Cafe (we then called it an Online Bistro) connected

TAPPLOCK HAS RESPONDED - SEE BELOW:
There is a metal pin inside this lock that is supposed to protrude into the back panel to keep it from rotating. (See 3:47 in the video on the right hand side of the lock.) Tapplock has said my particular unit is defective, and should not have come apart that easily. It seems to be more of a defective unit situation, instead of a poor design situation. Tapplock said they have reviewed the quality control and found no other defective units.  Tapplock will send free replacements to anyone who is able to displace the back-cover without damaging it. AND future batches will also come with proprietary screws. Just wanna keep you all updated!


Huge thanks to NordVPN for sponsoring this video. Stay secure!
At first glance this Tapplock fingerprint scanning padlock may seem like the way of the future... But is it? Is it secure? Is it safe? There is only one way to know for sure and thats with a review from the inside.

Fingerprint scanners are becoming the norm on smart phones and other devices, its no surprise now to see them on a padlock. With a one year battery life, and enough storage for 500 fingerprints, this lock seems super cool.

Made from solid metal, the Tapplock is anti pry and anti shim, making it pretty secure... but... but... what if there is an Achilles heel hidden 'round back. Is it possible to physically hack this $100 dollar smart lock? It is. Its great for the gym or something non valuable. But dont lock anything super secure with it.

As always, hit that subscribe button so you dont miss any of my future videos, And if Tapplock secures the next version of their lock, or fixes the current version, Ill be more than happy to update this video.

Miyazaki as a secret Idealist- “Personally I am very pessimistic. But when, for instance, one of my staff has a baby you can't help but bless them for a good future. Because I can't tell that child, 'Oh, you shouldn't have come into this life.' And yet I know the world is heading in a bad direction. So with those conflicting thoughts in mind, I think about what kind of films I should be making.”

Andre Black Nerd Retro Review of The Karate Kid (1984). Does The Karate Kid 1984 hold up? It's a Retro Retcon! Can The Karate Kid be enjoyed more today as a coming of age drama than it was as a nostalgia fighting film?

The Karate Kid (1984) is the underdog karate movie starring Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso, Billy Zabka as Johnny Lawrence, Elisabeth Shue as Ali Mills, Martin Kove as John Kreese, and Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. Ralph Macchio and Billy Zabka are returning to their roles 34 years later for the YouTube Red series Cobra Kai with Johnny Lawrence opening a new dojo and training a new Karate Kid. All episodes stream on YouTube Red on May 2.

Note: This video was sponsored by YouTube Red to promote Cobra Kai. All opinions about The Karate Kid 1984 are 100% my own.

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.

Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her Dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who - against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit - must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, “Tomb Raider” is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero. The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (“Ex Machina,” “The Danish Girl”) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”), with Oscar-winner Graham King (“The Departed”) producing under his GK Films banner. The film’s production began on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

“Tomb Raider” also stars Dominic West (“Money Monster,” “300”), Walton Goggins (“The Hateful Eight,” “Django Unchained”) and Daniel Wu (AMC’s “Into the Badlands”).

Shooting on location in South Africa and the UK, Uthaug directs from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet. The director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (“Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”); production designer Gary Freeman (“Maleficent”); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (“Skyfall,” “Gorillas in the Mist”); and costume designer Tim Wonsik (key costumer, “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”).
“Tomb Raider” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM.

The Spice Girls are not performing at the royal wedding, despite Mel B saying on ""The Real"" that the Spice Girls would be reuniting and performing.

Despite Mel B’s claim the group would reunite and perform at the reception, a source tells Page Six, “Only Victoria, Emma and Geri were invited, so clearly, the Spice Girls were never going to perform.”

Mel B is at home in Los Angeles and was never, in fact, invited.

Prologue : 
As the War of the Sith raged over the years populations of entire planets were destroyed. Among the victims both Jedi and soldiers of The Old Republic. 

Against the warnings of the Jedi council, Daivos Koran-gär,  guardian of the Jedi temple, joined the conflict. Unable to endure the planetary suffering, afraid of losing his little sister whom he was protecting, and unwilling to wait for the Sith to come to him, Daivos became a relentless fighter with the soldiers of the Republic. 

However, as they secured ground on the battlefield, the Sith attacked the very heart of the Republic, the Jedi temple Daivos was once sworn to protect. Arriving there too late, Daivos watched in horror as the security holograms showed the Sith destroying and slaughtering everything and everyone in their path including Jedi and even the children, some of them executed and others kidnapped. 

Daivos never saw his sister again, and overwhelmed by anger, his thirst for power overcame the force within. 

Searching for years, Daivos Koran-gär found one of the last remaining strongholds of the Force which he believes can help him find his sister and defeat the Sith.
