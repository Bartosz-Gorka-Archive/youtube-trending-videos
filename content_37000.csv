온앤오프(ONF), 미니 앨범 2집 [YOU COMPLETE ME] 발매!
YOU COMPLETE ME, 당신을 완성 시켜줄 단 하나의 음악!

2018년 6월, 뜨거운 신인 ‘온앤오프(ONF)’가 미니 2집 [YOU COMPLETE ME] 를 통해 또 한 번 도약에 나선다.

팀명과 동명인 첫 데뷔 앨범 [ON/OFF]로 세련된 음악과 퍼포먼스를 선보이며 성공적인 데뷔와 함께 글로벌 음악 팬들에게 강렬한 인상을 남긴 ‘온앤오프(ONF)’가 약 10개월 만에 완전체로 돌아온다..

‘온앤오프(ONF)’는 무대 위 강렬한 ON의 모습과, 친근하고 각자의 개성을 보여주는 OFF의 반전이 있는 매력이 공존한다는 의미의 팀 명처럼, 최근 오디션 프로그램을 통해 탁월한 실력으로 눈도장을 찍는 것은 물론이고, 유명 통신사 모델에 발탁되며 `무약정플랜` 편의 유튜브 조회수가 2000만건을 돌파하는 등 파격적인 신예 행보를 보이고 있어, 이번 앨범을 통해 또 한번의 비상을 준비하는 ‘온앤오프(ONF)’의 활동에 귀추가 주목된다.

이번 미니 2집 앨범 역시 프로듀싱팀 ‘모노트리’와의 환상적인 호흡으로, ‘온앤오프만(ONF)’의 아이덴티티를 십분 녹여내며, 어느 하나 버릴 수 없는 완성도 높은 곡들로 채워졌다.

타이틀곡 ‘Complete(널 만난 순간)’은 Verse와 Chorus의 대비되는 색채가, 때론 철없는 소년의 외침과 같다가도, 때론 도발적인 남자같은 상반된 느낌으로 몰아가다 후반부 색소폰이 리딩하는 드랍파트에서 절정을 이루는 곡이다. 특히 청량한 감성의 질주감 있는 하우스 비트는 한층 진해진 ‘온앤오프(ONF)’만의 색깔을 보여주며 또 한번의 성장을 예고한다. 

그 외 상대를 ‘달’ 에 비유하며 볼 수 없는 상대의 뒷면을 아직 내가 알지 못하는 ‘상대의 내면’ 으로 표현한 ‘Fly Me To The Moon’과, ‘온앤오프(ONF)’의 달콤한 보컬 색깔의 하모니를 만날 수 있는 ‘아침 (Good Morning)’, 꿈과 미래의 불안 가득한 이야기를 토해내듯 표현한  ‘Fifty Fifty’, 스웨덴을 대표하는 Dirty Loops와, 한국의 프로듀싱팀 모노트리가 합작해 만든 ‘온앤오프(ONF)’의 맞춤 곡 ‘나 말고 다 (Incomplete)’, 24시간=86400초 그 시간을 모두 너로 채워가고 싶다는 섬세한 노랫말이 돋보이는 팝 발라드 ‘스물네 번 (86400)’등 총 6곡이 수록 되어 있다.

특히 타이틀곡 ‘Complete(널 만난 순간)’의 뮤직비디오는, 영화 라라랜드 스태디캠 촬영 감독과 로봇암을 포함한 최고의 장비와 감각적인 카메라 워킹을 통해, ‘온앤오프(ONF)’의 화려하고 완벽한 퍼포먼스를 보여줄 수 있는 헐리웃 최고 스텝들이 참여하였으며, 감각적이고 다이나믹한 영상미가 눈길을 끈다.

‘온앤오프(ONF)’가 미니 2집 [YOU COMPLETE ME]를 통해 한층 강렬한 퍼포먼스와 아이덴티티가 담긴 음악으로 또 하나의 성장을 이루며 질주 할 수 있을지, 그들의 음악적 행보에 귀추가 주목된다.

Verse와 Chorus의 대비되는 색채가 때론 철없는 소년의 외침 같다가도, 때론 도발적인 남자같은 상반된 느낌으로 몰아가다 후반부 색소폰이 리딩하는 드랍파트에서 그 절정으로 몰아간다.
청량한 감성을 품은 질주감 있는 하우스 비트는 ‘온앤오프(ONF)’만의 장르를 만들고 있는듯 하며, ‘믿을지 모르겠지만 네가 있어야만 내가 완성돼’ 라는 가사는 이 곡의 전체를 아우르는 문장이다.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ka9zaVL28OY/sddefault.jpg,0.04014941444887537,0.00021815729522231292,184.0388349514563,0.002471743335188729,0.040367571744097684,0.04283931507928642,2018-06-07,09:00:04,Thursday,3,8,50,8,33,34,310,5,75,2,11,1,13,0,0,3.0,5.0,['music ENTERTAINMENT'],"['music', 'ENTERTAINMENT']",True,"['music', 'entertain']",2,2,14,0,0,0,0,5.3076529134991794,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 4},4

ABOUT RHOBH:
La La Land shines bright when Bravo Media's ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" returns for season eight. Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Lisa Vanderpump are joined by new housewife Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave and friend Camille Grammer for a season of lavish adventures, uncontrollable laugher and confrontations aplenty. Running her successful fitness and nutrition accountability business, newcomer Teddi moves through life with a strict ethos that she rarely strays from, even if this leads to differing opinions with some of the ladies. Friendly face Camille returns with a new outlook on life and is finally able to entertain the idea of remarrying, but when she struggles to get her ""sexy"" back, she turns to her friend Lisa Rinna for advice. This season, the ladies are busier than ever, juggling life at home and in the boardroom. In addition to wrapping production on her series ""American Woman"" and expanding her retail business, Kyle is at a crossroad when she has to decide whether to renovate or move out of the home where she's raised her daughters. Dorit gives herself just a couple months to re-launch her swimwear line, which proves to be a nearly impossible task. Erika pours herself into Erika Jayne's meteoric rise, back in the recording studio and opening up in shocking ways as she writes her autobiography. Meanwhile, Lisa Rinna is a focused ""momager"" to her two model daughters, who are poised to be the next ""it"" girls, but struggles to keep them grounded as they continue to travel the world and grow up very fast. Lisa Vanderpump is knee-deep in rescue dogs, as her new business, Vanderpump Dogs, continues to thrive, but will she be able to do it all once she also takes on editor of a magazine? From casual lunches to luxurious escapades, there's no doubt that living this large has its ups and downs, but these housewives have their famed zip code -- and then some -- in the palms of their hands.

With superb finishes inside and out, a custom 8’ x 6’ fibreglass double front entry is accented with wrought iron inserts and complete with a European 3-bolt locking system, opening into a home showcasing Canadian-made hardwood flooring; waffled ceilings; exquisite crown moldings and trims; high-end contemporary light fixtures and over 100 LED pot lights - as well as generously sized principal rooms and beautifully appointed private spaces.

An entertainer’s dream home - its open concept design, and ease of flow between the formal and informal rooms, can easily accommodate large gatherings - yet is also perfect for intimate get-togethers, especially in the family room, which has the added warmth of a gas fireplace.     

A showpiece of luxurious design and craftsmanship, the kitchen is complete with custom cabinetry accented by LED under mount and interior lighting; an exquisitely tiled back splash and quartz countertops; a centre island with vegetable sink and bar fridge; and high end appliances including a custom fridge/freezer, an induction cooktop, as well as built-in dishwasher, wall oven, and microwave - and off the kitchen is a well-designed laundry and mud room with a walk-in pantry, built-in cabinetry, access to the garage, and front load washer and dryer.

Between the kitchen and family room is the garden door walk-out onto a large stone patio with custom tempered glass and aluminum railing that steps down to another extensive stone patio in the backyard - and taking advantage of the abundance of warm natural lighting, throughout the home are oversized windows finished with custom Hunter Douglas window treatments for additional privacy.

This home has two master suites - the first through a double door entry off the reception hall. This luxurious sized retreat features a walk-in closet with custom organizers; as well as a stunning 5-pc ensuite washroom. Both this washroom and the second level master ensuite have heated tiled floors - while all the washrooms showcase custom cabinetry, quartz counters, as well as high-end Riobel vanity and shower fixtures.

A Hollywood-style open-tread hardwood staircase with wrought iron pickets leads to the upper level, where a grand open concept hallway leads to a second family room, gives access to four bedrooms, and to a second laundry room with front load washer and dryer as well as cabinetry and closet storage.

The family bedrooms are quite generously sized and naturally bright - with the second bedroom showcasing a 14’ x 14’ walk-in closet and dressing room with custom organizers. This bedroom has its own access to a 5-pc Jack-and-Jill washroom, which it shares with the third bedroom. This bedroom, as well as the fourth bedroom, both have large double closets and windows with transoms, while the fourth bedroom additionally features a double door entry.

The upper level family room is warmed by a gas fireplace with stacked stone cladding, and has a walk-out onto a balcony with glass and aluminum railing that has backyard and lake views. A great informal entertaining space, this room also features a wet bar, and access to the common-use 4-pc washroom.

The second master suite is exceptionally sized, has a double door entry, a 14’ x 14’ walk-in closet and dressing room with custom organizers, as well as plenty of space for a sitting area - while behind a sliding barn-style entry door is a beautifully finished 4-pc washroom. 

This home is smart-wired throughout, has 200 AMP service, two furnaces, and the entire property has closed circuit surveillance cameras. Extensively and professionally landscaped with an irrigation system for the lawns and perennial gardens, there is also a gas barbecue line in the backyard - and the home is complete with both an attached heated single car garage and a rear detached double garage with its own 60 AMP service panel, as well exterior driveway parking for up to 12 vehicles in total.

Fully, and beautifully finished, the lower level features a cedar-lined custom wine cellar across from the staircase landing, lots of storage, a luxurious 3-pc washroom, a full custom kitchen with stainless steel appliances, a huge 8’ x 30’ cold room with sink, as well as a wonderful open concept flow and design with abundant space for recreational and family use - and there is also a walk-out up to the backyard.

Well-situated, this stunning executive home is walking distance to highly rated Frenchman’s Bay Public School, as well as the West Shore Beach and walking trails of Rotary Frenchman’s Bay West Park. Boating enthusiasts will enjoy the proximity of the Frenchman’s Bay Yacht Club - while for commuters, both the Pickering GO Station and access to Hwy 401 are just short drives away.

Not seeing the court at all in the fourth quarter was Ball as the 76ers ran away with the contest in the final term to claim the win, 115-109.
Simmons finished just one rebound shy of his third career triple-double as he compiled 18 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists but it was his teammate Joel Embiid that stole the limelight.
Embiid was unstoppable on both ends of the floor and finished with the incredible statline of 46 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and seven blocks.
The win now puts the 76ers record at 8-6 on the season as they head home after completing a five-game Western Conference in which they won three games and lost two.
Simmons takes his season averages to 17.7 points per game, 9.2 rebounds and 7.7 assists and now ranks first amongst all rookies in total points, rebounds and assists.

Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are going to cause opposing teams nightmares for years to come and the Lakers got dealt a thorough lesson today.
The unstoppable big men combined for 64 points, 24 rebounds and 17 assists as they did whatever they pleased against a battling Lakers outfit.
Praise for the two giants has come in thick and fast this season but the showing put forth tonight blew away everyone’s expectations.
Embiid ended the encounter with a statline nobody in NBA history has ever compiled while Simmons became the first Philly player to compile his statline in four years.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kanH5nS6MTY/hqdefault.jpg,0.0032192268940604033,0.0001965940087975819,16.375,0.00044233651979455927,0.003415820902857985,0.0038581574226525454,2017-11-16,06:32:58,Thursday,3,16,1,16,1,87,2,3,2,0,0,8,0,3,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.570099924792548,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Unwind and get ready for bed with luxurious lavender-infused products. We’ve invited ASMR Darling (http://bit.ly/2jri9Vi) to walk you through these super #soothing products while creating some soft, #relaxing sounds to send you off to sleep with ease.
 
What is #ASMR? ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response, and it’s a pleasurable tingling sensation that’s triggered in some people by unique stimuli like soft, gentle speech, tapping or crinkling sounds, and personal attention. There are plenty of YouTube videos that exist just to trigger this sensation in viewers, and lots of people watch ASMR videos to relax before going to bed.

Nor'easter to become bomb cyclone: Fierce winds, flooding, snow and coastal havoc on tap

High winds to cause widespread power outages, travel disruptions and property damage.
Flooding rainfall in store for some locations, and coastal flooding will occur.
Rain to end as snow in many areas, with risk of a foot or more of heavy, wet snow in a narrow zone.
An already potent storm will track off the Atlantic coast and become a bomb cyclone that is likely to cause high winds, coastal flooding and heavy wet snow in the northeastern United States centered on Friday.

Part of the same storm already caused significant flooding and produced severe thunderstorms over the South Central states and will bring a change to heavy wet snow and strong winds to the lower Great Lakes region on Thursday night.

The full power of the storm will be felt in the Northeast. The storm will strengthen and the pressure in the center of the storm will plummet so fast that it will likely become another bomb cyclone of the winter of 2018.

Major trouble anticipated from high winds

The most far-reaching effect of the storm will be high winds. Gusts of 50-60 mph will be common from the central and southern Appalachians to the lower Great Lakes and part of northern New England. However, gusts approaching hurricane force are likely along the coast from Delmarva to eastern Massachusetts. The strongest winds are likely to be along the coast of eastern Massachusetts.

Extensive power outages are likely spanning Friday to Saturday. Have a working flashlight on hand, and keep cell phones charged.

Winds as strong as predicted can knock down trees, cause damage property and make loose objects into projectiles. Walking, standing or driving through areas where there is a canopy of trees may be very dangerous during the storm.

Major airline delays and flight cancellations are likely due to the wind alone from Chicago and Detroit to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston. Wind-related delays are possible as far south as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta.

Airlines were waiving change fees ahead of the storm, according to the USA Today.

Most of the problems from the storm in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore will be due to the wind and not so much from rain and any brief period of snow at the end.

Coastal inundation may behave like a tropical storm or hurricane

Depending on the wind direction, ocean and/or bay waters will be pushed inland, and substantial coastal flooding and beach erosion are anticipated. As the storm moves along and the wind shifts, areas that were not flooded initially may take on water.

Tides are likely to run 2-4 feet above normal. Tides may be as much as 5 feet above normal at peak, where the shape of the coast acts as a funnel and prevents water from escaping.

The worse conditions are likely in eastern Massachusetts, where officials have already asked coastal residents to evacuate, according to Mass Live.

Offshore waves of 30 feet are forecast. All vessels are encouraged to remain in port. Large vessels should remain at sea until the storm moves away later this weekend.
\

However, areas father south and north may also experience coastal flooding.

Lake shore flooding is likely along the southern shorelines of lakes Erie, Ontario and Michigan.

Storm to produce flooding rainfall in some communities

Rain will fall in most areas during the first part of the storm. As the storm strengthens, rainfall rates will increase along with the wind.

Rain may be so intense that it leads to widespread urban and small stream flooding from part of eastern Pennsylvania and central New Jersey on to the northeastern to eastern Massachusetts. Rainfall in part of this area may range between 3 and 5 inches from the storm, with the heaviest rainfall likely during the day Friday.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kb_RpG4Fr8c/sddefault.jpg,0.02664849367862011,0.001174977675424167,22.68,0.01048080086478357,0.027823471354044272,0.03830427221882785,2018-03-01,16:42:07,Thursday,3,13,71,13,71,79,689,2,214,1,3,7,45,2,0,5.0,9.0,"['tT a 1 nate', '', 'ETRE', '', 'HISTORIC', 'vi aS):']","['tT', 'a', '1', 'nate', 'ETRE', 'HISTORIC', 'vi', 'aS):']",True,"['tT', 'a', '1', 'nate', 'etr', 'histor', 'vi', 'aS', ')', ':']",10,10,23,2,0,0,2,5.8114754424901225,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'tv': 1},1

The film directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Sterling K. Brown, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis has certainly destroyed box office records. It’s a fans’ and critics’ darling that has already become a very beloved movie, but is it too soon to rank it #1 on the top 100 movies of all time? And what algorithm is Rotten Tomatoes using to create these rankings?

Mark Reilly and John Rocha answer these questions and offer their opinions on this ranking. They also explore the overall construction of the list and how certain films that are considered Top 10 locks are nowhere near the top 10 of this list. Let us know what you think about this Rotten Tomatoes ranking of ‘Black Panther’ and what you thought of what Reilly and Rocha had to say about it in the Comments sections below.

I know it’s early in 2018, but I think I’ve seen what will go down as one of my favorite films of the year: writer/director Alex Garland’s Annihilation. Based on Jeff VanderMeer’s terrifying eco-horror novel of the same name, the movie stars Natalie Portman as a biologist and former soldier who joins a mission to uncover what exactly happened to her husband (Oscar Isaac) inside Area X, which is a mysterious—and growing—patch of land in the United States that seems to fundamentally alter everything in its path. Annihilation also stars Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez,Tuva Novotny, and Oscar Isaac.

Unlike a lot of movies where everything is explained and watered down by studio notes and focus groups, Annihilation is a hard sci-fi thriller where you’re constantly trying to figure out what is happening, and I loved every second of it. In addition, the film contains a lot of weird and bold choices that will infuriate some and leave others floored by its brilliance. It’s the type of film that rarely gets made and I commend Paramount Pictures for releasing it.

With Annihilation arriving in theaters this weekend in North America, I recently sat down with Natalie Portman for an exclusive video interview. She talked about memorable moments from filming, how they filmed a sequence with a monster where the cast didn’t know the monster was going to come out and try and attack them, how she managed to pull off firing the machine gun without blinking, and being part of a movie where the people trying to figure out what happened are all women scientists.

Yup, we're in that weird part of YouTube again. The place where neon text, quirky electronic jazz music, and historical edutainment can all come together and somehow make total sense. And on today's episode of ""A Brief History,"" we take a look at how a man named Bill Wurtz managed to bring that weird part of YouTube to the forefront of the site & make a name for himself after more than a decade of making content.

Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.

Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.

I never said I was your goddamn superman
Late at night, sittin’ up in my room 
Sippin’ on adrenaline and pacing over you 
Lately you hate what I say 
But you can’t hate me to my face 
I’m for real, just call it like I see 
Obsessed and possessive
You don’t know true shit about me 
There’s a temper in your tone 
That mouth left you on your own 

Fake, fake it till you make
Enough to buy some faith from who 
Is dumb enough to pray to you 

Hero, hero 
Everybody just want a payroll 
If the price is right, they might be your 
Hero, hero 

Pray to these fake relatable gods 
Pay them for attention till they get off 

Fake, fake it till you make

- New V6 and Toyota Hybrid System Powertrains Offering More Power and MPG
- New TNGA K Sedan Platform with Multi-Link Rear Suspension and Available Toyota-First Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS)
- Standard Entune 3.0 with WiFi Hotspot, Qi Wireless Charging, Toyota Remote Connect with Smartwatch and Amazon Alexa Connectivity, and Apple CarPlay

PRELIMINARY EXTERIOR DIMENSIONS
Wheelbase 113.0 in.
Overall Length 196.0 in.
Overall Width 72.8 in.
Overall Height 56.5 in.

Underpinned by a Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform, and powered by a fuel-efficient 3.5-liter V6 or Toyota Hybrid System (THS II) powertrain, the 2019 Toyota Avalon embodies consumers’ overarching desire for high-caliber, design-centric, technologically-savvy modes of attainable, premium transportation.
 
To its menu, Avalon mixes a bevy of Toyota-firsts such as standard Apple CarPlay and Dynamic Auxiliary Turn Signals, available authentic Yamaha wood and aluminum cabin accents, and Engine Sound Enhancement. In addition, drivers will appreciate the standard passive and active safety benefits through Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), as well as athletic handling thanks to its available Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), also a Toyota first, that, quite positively, has Avalon out-performing its peers.

Avalon’s available LED Vision Tech headlamps are the most advanced lighting realized by Toyota. The slim headlights employed by XLE and XSE grades utilize a cluster of three reflectors for Daytime Running Lights (DRL) and low- and high-beam functions, providing exceptional light disbursement in an array of situations, including foul, low-visibility weather.

Avalon’s various height measurements have been trimmed: overall (by 1 in. to 56.5 in.), cowl (by 1.2 in.), and rear deck (by 0.8 in.). So too have front and rear overhangs (down 0.4 in. and 1.0 in., respectively). Along with its wider front (up 0.4 in.) and rear (up 1.5 in.) tracks, width (up 0.8 in. to 72.8 in.), and wheelbase (up 2.0 in.), Avalon’s premium aura and sporty stature are further emphasized.

Soft-touch materials are noticeable throughout – around the flowing, low-profile center console decorated in piano black trim; on the slim, tiered instrument panel leading into the doors; in the rear compartment, where doors and console mirror the impressive craftsmanship seen in the front cockpit. A rear cup and device holder, accented in piano black and satin chrome-finish, folds up and down in the armrest between passengers. Ahead of their knees and within arm’s reach: air vents, controls for the available seat warmers, and essential USB charging ports. Deep curvatures in the doors’ armrests provide passengers with ample surface area and comfort during long commutes. Rear seat roominess is exemplified by Avalon’s segment-best measurements in three categories: shoulder room (57.1 in.), leg space (40.3 in. for V6; 40.4 in. for Hybrid), and headroom (37.5 in. for V6; 37.1 in. for Hybrid).

A JBL performance audio system is standard on Limited and Touring grades and is available on XLE and XSE grades. XLE and XSE passengers can listen to crisp tunes on a standard 8-speaker system having Entune 3.0 Audio Plus with Connected Navigation Scout GPS Link App and Entune 3.0 App Suite Connect, featuring new in-vehicle third-party applications. Apple CarPlay is standard on all grades.
 
Entune 3.0 Toyota Connected Services include: Safety Connect and Service Connect with a 3-year trial period and Remote Connect with a 6-month trial. Wi-Fi Connect Powered by Verizon trial with up to 2GB within 6 months and Entune 3.0 App Suite is subscription-free.

Hustle, athleticism, and fuel-efficiency. Each of these riveting traits has improved, in large part, because of two new TNGA powertrains: a punchy 3.5-liter V6 (2GR-FKS), and, a 2.5-liter Dynamic Force four-cylinder Toyota Hybrid System II (THS II) with a 650-volt electric motor (A25A-FXS) and Continuously-Variable Transmission (CVT). Avalon Hybrid continues to be the only full hybrid vehicle in the segment.
 
The TNGA-derived V6 develops more power with less fuel consumption than ever before. Achieving the two took the application of D-4S direct injection, along with an updated VVT-iW (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent Wide) variable valve timing system.
 
The VVT-iW system is employed on the intake cycle, with VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing - Intelligent) activated on exhaust. With VVT-iW in place, engineers ensured optimal torque creation at all engine speeds, and minimized pumping losses during the closing of intake valves, which furthered fuel efficiency. The use of Atkinson cycle, too, reduces the V6’s fuel appetite, particularly in cold climates or during wide-open throttle (WOT) situations.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

Living in 2018, most of you are aware that Alexa is Amazon’s semi creepy home assistant that talks to you and does whatever you tell her to do. She’s basically a mixture of a 50s Stepford wife and Smart House. She has a new commercial coming your way on Sunday that will air during the big game in which amazon goes into panic mode upon learning that Alexa has somehow lost her voice. The solution is replacing her with the voices of A-list celebrities including Cardi B. 
And you best believe that with Cardi as your new Alexa, the sass setting is at an all-time high. 
Cardi teased the upcoming commercial on instagram with a short 14 second clip with the caption – “Washpoppin this weekend @Amazon?? #ad” This is a big deal for Cardi. First she performs at the Grammys with multiple nominations under her belt and now shes going to be in a Super bowl commercial?? Dreams come true people. In the commercial, Cardi is joined by Rebel Wilson and Gordon Ramsay who also lend their voices to help out Alexa in her time of need. You can catch the commercial in full when it airs on Sunday during the fourth quarter. What do you guys think about the idea of having your favorite celebrities voice your Alexas?

Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey and I’ll see you next time.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

The first 10,000 examples of the ES8 will be built in a high-spec 'Founder Edition' at 548,000 yuan (£61,800) but the company claims all have already been sold. There's no official confirmation of a launch in the US or Europe, but bosses have previously expressed a desire to expand beyond the home market. 

New NIO ES8 Full Review
    NIO officially launches the ES8 in China with a base price of RMB 448,000, and unveils a battery rental plan.

    ES8 owners will be first to access NIO Power, a three-minute battery-swapping solution demonstrated during NIO Day

The NIO ES8 is a 7-seater high performance electric SUV. The NIO ES8 has a base price of  RMB 448,000 before subsidies, with 10,000 Founder’s Editions available for RMB 548,000. A battery rental plan is available to NIO users, which provides a RMB 100,000 discount on the purchase price of the ES8. The battery rental subscription is RMB 1,280 per month and enables ES8 owners to enjoy battery upgrading services, along with quality assurance, roadside assistance, car connectivity, and nationwide charging services. The NIO ES8 is customized and will be made to order. Those interested in purchasing an ES8 can place an order through the NIO App.
With both front and rear motors, the NIO ES8 delivers 480 kilowatts of power and 840 Newton meters of torque to all four wheels. This E-powertrain enables the ES8 to accelerate from 0-100 km/h in just 4.4 seconds. The latest active air suspension on all ES8’s models creates comfortable, connected riding experience.

The ES8 is equipped with a 70-kilowatt-hour liquid-cooled battery pack comprised of cutting-edge VDA square cell batteries. These cells feature the highest energy density of their kind and provide a 2,000-charge lifecycle. The ES8’s drag coefficient is as low as 0.29. The ES8 achieves over 500 kilometers of range when constantly run at 60 kph, and the car achieves an NEDC range of 355 kilometers.
The ES8’s goes beyond five-star safety. The ES8 is the first car to have an all-aluminium body and chassis featuring aerospace grade 7003 series aluminium alloy, enabling a torsional stiffness of 44,140 Nm/Deg. The ES8 features the highest amount of aluminium for any mass production car. With the excellent passive safety design and 21 active safety features, the ES8 stands out among vehicles in its class.
The ES8 is produced at a world-class fully automated factory. The R&D, design,  supply chain, and factory ensure the ES8’s premium quality. The ES8 will finish a 3,000,000km road test before NIO begins delivering the vehicle to users.

The ES8 has a  3,010 millimeter long wheelbase, the longest in its class, to create a truly mobile living space. The three-row, seven-seat layout makes full use of the interior space. The innovative “lounge seat” and “child-care mode”, together with the Nappa leather wrap, creates a cozy atmosphere, making users feel at home. The smart air quality system includes an activated carbon and HEPA filter and negative ion generator.
NIO launches NIO Pilot, its comprehensive advanced driver assistance system. NIO PILOT is enabled by 23 sensors, including a trifocal front-facing camera, four surround exterior cameras, five millimeter-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and a driver monitor camera. The ES8 is the world’s first vehicle to come equipped with the Mobileye EyeQ4, which has a computation capacity eight-times more powerful than its predecessors. NIO PILOT’s software and hardware suite enables subscribers to enjoy upgraded services through FOTA updates.

NIO introduces NOMI, the world’s first in-car AI system. Powered by both in-car and cloud computation, NOMI interacts with people sitting in the vehicle and its emotion engine gives users a friend on the road. NOMI combines the ES8’s intelligence and car connectivity functionalities to turn the ES8 into a fun, expressive, and intuitive companion that can listen, talk, and help drivers along the way.
NIO unveils NIO Power, a new charging experience that allows the ES8’s battery to be swapped in three minutes. NIO Power also includes NIO Power Home, super charger network, and Power Mobile. Power Mobile is a brand-new power service product developed by NIO, which enables an ES8 to run 100 kilometers after charging for ten minutes. By 2020, NIO plans to build over 1,100 Power Swap Stations and deploy over 1,200 Power Mobile vehicles.

The great white shark is imposing and dangerous, and some can also be giants.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-THE SEVEN STAR LAKE SHARK
It happened on May 14, 1997 in Hualien County in Taiwan, when a large white was caught in a net game precisely in Seven Star Lake.

-DEEP BLUE SHARK
In 2013, the images of this great white shark became viral all over the world. Therefore, because of its popularity, you should know that it is one of the largest specimens ever seen.

-AUSTRALIAN SHARK

-THE COJIMAR ESPECIMEN
The legend of a monster submerged in its waters was revealed as a gigantic 21 feet long white shark. Truly impressive!

-CANADIAN SHARK
On a hot summer day in early August of 1983, Alberton native David McKendrick, along with his younger brother Steven and his crew, fished near the coast of Prince Edward Island in Canada. Suddenly, 12 miles from the beach, the nets began to stir as if someone were trying to get fish out. A huge shark was stranded there.

-MEXICAN SHARK
In April 2012, two commercial fishermen named Guadalupe and Baltazar entered the Sea of ​​Cortez in search of what they normally caught, such as sole or other types of fish. What they never imagined was that they would encounter a huge shark off the coast of the state of Sonora, northwest of Mexico.

-SHARK OF LEDGE POINT
The great white shark, also known as the ""great white pointer"", is responsible for the majority of sharks attacks recorded against humans.

Remember that in these difficult times it is moment to prevent and follow the recommendations so #StayHome and learn #WithMe

We grew up watching #Incredibles by Disney Pixar, over and over again! Coming to you NOW, however, is our older teenage parody version of what it must be like to be a Super from the INCREDIBLES in real life! 

Our LASH NEXT DOOR mascara and hair scrunchies are BACK IN STOCK! Click here HERE before they sell out! ▶️  http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com

We filmed 20 different real-life scenarios that would be INCREDIBLY awkward or more difficult if you had to wear your super suit all the time! Brooklyn takes the role of Violet, or Vi, our friend Cameron plays Dash, and I'm dressing up as a new character from the movie, Voyd! 

We find out what it’s like to get wedgies all the time in pubic, to getting in and out of the supersuit to go to the bathroom, and to jump in the pool with our supersuits on! 👙 The STRUGGLE of everyday life as an Incredible is real! 

The accessories on a supersuit are almost the most inconvenient part about them! Masks, gloves, knee-high boots??? HOWEVER, how do you think we look in these SUPER fab costumes! 😂

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
With nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple colored lipgloss
Room with the saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in, oh
For I get way too adamant about it

[Verse 2]
Love the way you shiver
Dig in to my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Paris and Juliet
Legends never die
The TV hasn't worked in ages
Prolly got a shorted cable
Way too busy fucking on the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy?
You look like you're someone famous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for

[Verse 3]
'Cause you're something like the summer
Kinda like a hurricane
Sweepin' through the desert
Hot Americana rain
Finally wearing nothing but my Lauryn Hill shirt
It's kinda baggy on you, baby but it work
The AC hasn't worked in ages
I could prolly read the label
Way too busy fucking on the counter or the coffee table
Am I hallucinating?
Why do you look hella famous?

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kudi8OtMu9s/sddefault.jpg,0.005794577011299426,0.0003073498975150368,18.853355924792304,0.00013660742056144945,0.006101926908814464,0.0062385343293759115,2018-02-15,19:57:19,Thursday,3,8,60,8,50,50,457,3,85,0,7,7,48,0,0,5.0,7.0,['ae 43'],"['ae', '43']",True,"['ae', '43']",2,2,4,0,0,0,0,4.798381055968184,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kvIvzbhx68s/sddefault.jpg,0.022238985848965984,0.00027151952315024124,81.90566037735849,0.0010220404692164742,0.022510505372116227,0.0235325458413327,2018-05-02,08:35:01,Wednesday,2,10,37,10,32,52,330,3,76,0,1,8,16,3,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.398842816154853,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Transformers: The Last Knight is a 2017 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line created by Hasbro. It is the fifth installment of the live-action Transformers film series, the second film in the sequel trilogy and the sequel to 2014's Transformers: Age of Extinction. Like its predecessors, the film is directed by Michael Bay, featuring Mark Wahlberg returning from Age of Extinction, with Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, and Glenn Morshower all reprising their roles from the first three films, with Laura Haddock and Anthony Hopkins both joining the cast. Bay and Wahlberg have stated they will not return for another sequel.

Marvel is known for having well thought out characters and plot lines that string all the films together. The entire MCU is brilliantly made into a completely other world in which we only dream to live. There are some changes within the films that we’re certain Marvel Studios and Disney tried to sneak by us to not throw off their perfect creation...but alas, we have caught them! 

Actor changes like Edward Norton and Terrence Howard in films like Ant-Man and Iron Man represented some of the biggest changes. Others included a blonde Black Widow and an accent-less Scarlet Witch, which we easily noticed. What do Dominic Cooper and John Slattery share in common? Does someone have beef with Robert Downey Jr. who plays Iron Man, AKA Tony Stark? Why has Thanos’ appearance changed? Why was the Hulk recast? And did Fandral from Thor get a makeover? The famous cast of Marvel films include, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, Josh Brolin, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chadwick Boseman, and Mark Ruffalo. The spanning over a decade have gone from “Guardians of the Galaxy” to “Ant-Man” and now finally have arrived at “Avengers: Infinity War,” with many more films slated to come. Through their entire repertoire, we found all the mistakes Marvel tried to hide and we’re going to reveal them all to you! 

Watch this video and count how many of these changes you already noticed or perhaps the ones that slipped right by. You’ll be shocked at these major changes that many didn’t even catch!

Entry 1 THE HULK SWITCH
Entry 2 BLONDE BLACK WIDOW
Entry 3 THANOS APPEARANCE CHANGED

Andre Black Nerd at the Black Panther World Premiere seeing the Black Panther movie for the first time and giving a reaction to the movie (not a review as reviews are still embargoed until a date later than when this video posted). Also attending the Black Panther Press Junket featuring interviews with the Black Panther cast, a lot of Black Panther merchandise, and Black Panther costumes from the movie. Plus quick thoughts on ignoring ""the haters"" trying to take away the excitement of the Black Panther movie release from people ready to celebrate having a movie like this in theaters, especially during Black History Month.

What is Virtual Reality? Virtual Reality is a medium with the ability to be transported to other places, to be fully immersed in experiences and to feel like you are really there. 
All you need is a Virtual Reality headset and a Virtual Reality video. Enjoy ;)

There were a lot of historic moments at the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards last night including Aziz Ansari winning the award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Television Series for his role in “Master of None”!  He made history because he is the first Asian-American to win that award in his category. Now people are usually surprised by their win because you just never know who is actually going to take the award home, but Aziz was shocked.

I think it’s pretty clear what they censored, but just in case you can’t figure it out. He combined shhhh with litty and took out the l. Get it? Cool. He went on to thank Netflix, the cast and crew, Italy because that’s where they shot Season 2, and of course his parents. Now even though he was censored, it didn’t take away from his historic win. Congrats Aziz and can’t wait to see you win more in the future.

Now I want to hear from you. What did you think about Aziz Ansari’s speech? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below. I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr., thanks so much for watching and I’ll see you next time.

DID YOU KNOW Japan has bullet trains that can travel 320 km/hour? Or superior toilet seats that can heat up your butt, clean it spotless, and check your blood pressure? Or interactive robots that can serve you lunch, analyze your facial expressions and be your customer service agent in phone stores?

I just finished my 6th visit to Japan, and every time I leave this country, I have a hard time comprehending what I just experienced.

In this video, I take you around Tokyo and show you 10 ways that Japan is 10 years ahead of the world.

Anyone else agree with me?

PRELIMINARY EXTERIOR DIMENSIONS
Wheelbase 113.0 in.
Overall Length 196.0 in.
Overall Width 72.8 in.
Overall Height 56.5 in.

Underpinned by a Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform, and powered by a fuel-efficient 3.5-liter V6 or Toyota Hybrid System (THS II) powertrain, the 2019 Toyota Avalon embodies consumers’ overarching desire for high-caliber, design-centric, technologically-savvy modes of attainable, premium transportation.
 
To its menu, Avalon mixes a bevy of Toyota-firsts such as standard Apple CarPlay and Dynamic Auxiliary Turn Signals, available authentic Yamaha wood and aluminum cabin accents, and Engine Sound Enhancement. In addition, drivers will appreciate the standard passive and active safety benefits through Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), as well as athletic handling thanks to its available Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), also a Toyota first, that, quite positively, has Avalon out-performing its peers.

Avalon’s available LED Vision Tech headlamps are the most advanced lighting realized by Toyota. The slim headlights employed by XLE and XSE grades utilize a cluster of three reflectors for Daytime Running Lights (DRL) and low- and high-beam functions, providing exceptional light disbursement in an array of situations, including foul, low-visibility weather.

Avalon’s various height measurements have been trimmed: overall (by 1 in. to 56.5 in.), cowl (by 1.2 in.), and rear deck (by 0.8 in.). So too have front and rear overhangs (down 0.4 in. and 1.0 in., respectively). Along with its wider front (up 0.4 in.) and rear (up 1.5 in.) tracks, width (up 0.8 in. to 72.8 in.), and wheelbase (up 2.0 in.), Avalon’s premium aura and sporty stature are further emphasized.

Soft-touch materials are noticeable throughout – around the flowing, low-profile center console decorated in piano black trim; on the slim, tiered instrument panel leading into the doors; in the rear compartment, where doors and console mirror the impressive craftsmanship seen in the front cockpit. A rear cup and device holder, accented in piano black and satin chrome-finish, folds up and down in the armrest between passengers. Ahead of their knees and within arm’s reach: air vents, controls for the available seat warmers, and essential USB charging ports. Deep curvatures in the doors’ armrests provide passengers with ample surface area and comfort during long commutes. Rear seat roominess is exemplified by Avalon’s segment-best measurements in three categories: shoulder room (57.1 in.), leg space (40.3 in. for V6; 40.4 in. for Hybrid), and headroom (37.5 in. for V6; 37.1 in. for Hybrid).

A JBL performance audio system is standard on Limited and Touring grades and is available on XLE and XSE grades. XLE and XSE passengers can listen to crisp tunes on a standard 8-speaker system having Entune 3.0 Audio Plus with Connected Navigation Scout GPS Link App and Entune 3.0 App Suite Connect, featuring new in-vehicle third-party applications. Apple CarPlay is standard on all grades.
 
Entune 3.0 Toyota Connected Services include: Safety Connect and Service Connect with a 3-year trial period, and Remote Connect with a 6-month trial. Wi-Fi Connect Powered by Verizon trial with up to 2GB within 6 months and Entune 3.0 App Suite is free.

Hustle, athleticism, and fuel-efficiency. Each of these riveting traits has improved, in large part, because of two new TNGA powertrains: a punchy 3.5-liter V6 (2GR-FKS), and, a 2.5-liter Dynamic Force four-cylinder Toyota Hybrid System II (THS II) with 650-volt electric motor (A25A-FXS) and Continuously-Variable Transmission (CVT). Avalon Hybrid continues to be the only full hybrid vehicle in the segment.
 
The TNGA-derived V6 develops more power with less fuel consumption than ever before. Achieving the two took the application of D-4S direct injection, along with an updated VVT-iW (intelligent Wide) variable valve timing system.
 
The VVT-iW system is employed on the intake cycle, with VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing - Intelligent) activated on exhaust. With VVT-iW in place, engineers ensured optimal torque creation at all engine speeds, and minimized pumping losses during the closing of intake valves, which furthered fuel efficiency. The use of Atkinson cycle, too, reduces the V6’s fuel appetite, particularly in cold climates or during wide-open throttle (WOT) situations.

If that’s you, then you tend to enjoy spending as much time on your own as possible. Of course, this doesn't mean that you're lonely. You do have friends, but you just like being alone and have less of a need for socializing than most.

Loners are strong willed, and if there is anything extremely important to a loner, it is time. And you respect and value time more than anything else. Also, you tend to be among the most empathetic people in the entire world. Your intuition is your constant guide, and that’s one of the biggest signs of empathy.

People who like to be alone always have healthy boundaries. And even though you like to be alone, you are open-minded. At the same time, you’re more than aware of what your strengths and weaknesses are. And you tend to look at the bright side, no matter what life throws in your way.

You are an extremely unique individual if you have the special personality traits outlined in this video!

Mobil 1 Annual Protection is a motor oil that’s designed to last a full year, or 20,000 miles. It’s available in 0W-20, 5W-20, and 5W-30 viscosity grades. I spent two days touring Mobil 1’s EMRE facility in Paulsboro, NJ, to learn about the process of creating Mobil 1 Annual 
Protection. It starts with formulation, goes through an extensive series of lab screening tests, engine tests, MADS tests, and real world tests, all before marketing claims can be made and the product is put on shelves. This video will be a general overview of the two days I spent at the EMRE facility, learning about how this product is created and tested.

SOL- stands for Sing Out Loud!
I started SOL- because my wife and I like to have
karaoke nights in our home, but I realized there weren’t
any (update to date) Contemporary Christian Karaoke Videos
available on Youtube. For the longest time I kept saying
to myself, Why? Until January 3, 2016, I decided to make
my own, and upload them to Youtube, Facebook etc. and
offer them to anyone who loves to sing Contemporary
Christian Karaoke. So enjoy them; tell your family, tell
your friends that SOL- has Contemporary Christian (BackDrop) Karaoke Songs!

Sing Out Loud's Goal is to influence, and promo Worship unto God.

Things Are Better When Your Singin Out Loud!

What Is BackDrop Karaoke?
""Sol- is NOT Karaoke."" You just helped me re-define it as ""BackDrop Karaoke!"" Where we push the lead vocalist to the background, so YOU can sing the lead. Because, not only do you have the lyrics, but you also have the faint singing of the vocalist as a guide. Thanks again, and Sing It Out Loud!

RECIPE:
Supplies:
Casserole dish

Ingredients:
4 filets of herring (or any white fish or mackerel or cod… any white fish will do)
2 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream 
1/2 cup of dry white cooking wine 
1/4 cup lemon juice 
4 tbsp butter 
3 tbsp of flour
1 small onion diced 
2 large cloves of garlic, diced 
1/2 cup carrots, chopped 
½ cup of corn
1 cup of pumpkin (or japanese pumpkin, squash) chopped 
¼ cup of mushrooms, diced
1 tbsp of dill 
A dash of salt and pepper
2 eggs, one yolk for egg wash.
2 boxes of frozen puff pastry dough
black olives


Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F, pull out your puff pastry   dough from the freezer to defrost.
Place filets in a small pan.  Mix heavy whipping cream and white wine and 1/4 of freshly squeezed lemon juice and pour wine cream mixture over fish until the fish are just covered. Bring liquid to a boil, cover fish and poach for between 5-10 minutes until fish becomes firm. Drain liquid from fish and set aside. Let fish cool. 
Chop onions and garlic. Saute them in a large frying pan with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper until they become clear for about 5 minutes.  Add the white wine sauce to your pan, and bring to a boil.  Add 3 tbsp of flour and whisk continuously.  Your sauce will begin to thicken into gravy.  
Add the rest of your chopped vegetables to the pan (pumpkin, carrots, mushrooms, corn) as well as the dill. Break off pieces of your fish and mix into the sauce as well. Add a dash of salt and pepper. Allow to cook for 5 minutes or until mushrooms are translucent. Remove from heat.
Separate one egg and put yolk aside.  Crack remaining egg into the egg white, beat and lightly fold into your eggs into your pie filling.
Transfer the filling into your prepared casserole dish.  Egg wash the edge of the filling to adhere the crust. 
Using only part of your puff pastry, place the pastry sheet over the dish and trim around the dish. The leftover puff pastry will be used to create the top of the dish.  Make 1 inch strips and lie them diagonally with 1 inch in between each one.  Egg wash the top of your dish.  Cut out your fish with a knife. (scoring, adding eye, etc.) Gently place the fish in the middle and apply more egg wash to your fish to seal the deal.
Garnish the top with black olives cut in half.
Bake pie for 20-30 minutes, top should be golden brown. Remove and let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Products Mentioned:
flower beauty beauty flash full face palette- 16.99
flower beauty lash warrior mascara- 9.99
flower beauty light illusion liquid foundation- 13.99
flower beauty light illusion full coverage concealer- 9.99
flower beauty brow vixen tattoo effect stain- 9.99

All in all my favorite products are definitely the concealer and brow stain! Those are the 2 items that I see myself using regularly.
The foundation wasn't bad at all, especially with the concealer, but it did not last a long time on my oily skin! Definitely wouldn't work for me in the summer if its breaking up that bad on me in the colder months.
The mascara was ok. I personally love my $4 essence one more since it does give me a lot of volume, but this is a good standard mascara.
The face palette is definitely ideal for someone who wants a one-stop shop for their makeup. perfect for beginners who don't know where to start as well. The bronzer is too warm for my liking, but you could always use something else!
I hope you guys enjoy the video!

You have seen them everywhere, but often don’t think of them or even look at them. Those short stubby mushroom headed citizens can be found all over the place. Toad is an odd character, but quite fitting in the Mushroom Kingdom. The loyal servants of Princess Peach are always there to lend a hand and also to tell you that the princess is in another castle. They don’t always speak, but when they do, it is often in that shrill and scratchy voice that is two parts annoying and one part endearing. Just like Link, Toad also has a very unique sound, but unlike Link, they are actually capable of forming complete sentences. Toads are a lot like minions actually. 

They all look alike with a few variations, seem to come out of nowhere with no reasonable explanation and...come to think about it, that’s about it. Toads are nothing like Minions. More to the point, what do we really know about thee mushroom capped henchmen? Where did they come from? How do they fit into the Mario franchise? Have you ever wondered what is under their hats or if that mushroom cap is a part of their head? Well, we intend to answer all of these questions and more in today’s video. If you enjoyed this video, be sure to give us a like. Do you have a favorite fact about Toad? If so, leave it in the comments, we would really appreciate it.

'Frontline' Lyrics:

there's a place you hold
i left behind
i’m finished
since you took your time
you should know why
i’m quitting

the secrets i hide, i do nothing
you’ll always deny that we're going in circles
but i'll override
could be winter but i burn inside
in the back of my mind i hear nothing
keep this feeling alive, i fear nothing now
then i'm in my ride
anything i left behind
don't mean nothing now

couldn't take it back 
even tho you wish i could
if you think i'm going back
you misunderstood
cry and talk about it, baby
but it ain't no use 
see you wasn't lookin when i pushed
hold up, wait
you fuckin wit my groove
gettin on this plane
making moves
cry and talk about it, baby
but it ain't no use
i ain't gonna sit here with your blues

if it ain't your life
i don't know how
to live it
and it broke me down
i almost drowned
it's not the ending

the secrets i hide, i do nothing
you'll always deny that we're going in circles
but i'll override
could be winter but i burn inside
in the back of my mind i hear nothing
keep this feeling alive, i fear nothing now
it's a race against time
when you're on the front line...

couldn't take it back 
even tho you wish i could
if you think i'm going back
you misunderstood
cry and talk about it, baby
but it ain't no use 
see you wasn't lookin when i pushed
hold up, wait
you fuckin wit my groove
gettin on this plane
making moves
cry and talk about it, baby
but it ain't no use
i ain't gonna sit here with your blues

i’ll tell you what
there's no luck
it’s all me
i’m staying up, don't wait up
cuz they're betting on me
coming up with the sun around me
fire me up, now i'm up
and i won't be taken down
little luck, tell you what, it's all me
i’m stayin up, don't wait up
cuz they're betting on me
coming up with the sun around me
fire me up, now i'm up and there's no coming down

The day started off looking pretty busy when we first saw the bag check stations all the way out in the parking garage with a huge line. We noticed some people going around these bag check stations and heading into the hub so we went to investigate and found many more bag check stations in the hub open and excepting guests! We made it through security in about 3 mins. The next long line we had to go through was the line to get in to the park which wasn't too bad because the majority of people were still in line to buy their tickets. Once in the park we walked around looking at high wait times and seeing shows. We stopped for a minute to watch the holiday Marilyn Monroe show with her diamond girls. After we made our way around Universal Studios Resort we walked over to see how Islands of Adventure was doing. The crowds were pretty much the same in both parks, but the difference was in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. They had barricades set up ready to close the area off if it got too full of people. When we were there this didn't happen, but they were ready if it did and with the holiday castle show I'm sure it happened later that night.

Lyrics:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more
Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas right now
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more
Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough
A merry little Christmas now

Our fire ants, black crazy ants, and yellow crazy ants have yet to inhabit a home as cool and epic as this new paludarium. It is an ant island we create in today's episode, called El Dragon Island. After losing our Titans last week, I made sure to create a setup surrounded by a moat of water to keep intruders out.

There were a few challenges however. We needed to prepare the waters for the living things we were going to place in its turbulent, river waters. We had to biologically stabilize the water before adding our various shrimp and plants. We sought to create an Asian biotope in the waters of El Dragon, and explain more about that in this video.

Finally, we learn more about our new Polyrhachis ant colony and release them onto our brand new island. You won't believe what we observe them do! It was something not yet documented by science!

Special thanks to Dave General from University of Philippines Los Banos, providing species identification and info. Special thanks as well to Pet Zone in San Juan, Metro Manila Philippines for the help and useful aquarium equipment.

For those who have been vacationing on Jupiter, GoPro, Inc. is the American technology company founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman. It manufactures eponymous action cameras and develops its own mobile apps and video-editing software.

From the Biz-Doc: THANK YOU to everyone who made a comment about Karma.  You are correct!

1.  I probably should have added that in detail - Karma was the drone that was (1) very late to the market - launched in October 2016; (2) performed badly and got recalled a month later when the battery suddenly would fail and it would crash and (3) got it’s butt kicked by DJI who was already in the market.

2.  The core issue of trying to be a Media Company in 2014 was the strategic distraction to the company - and this distraction caused them to spend a TON of cash and directly caused them to lose focus on their core products.  While on that path, they missed the rise of the drone market (the media team was laid off in December 2016, immediately following Karma) and played catch-up with a bad product.

3.  All of this opened the door for cheap knock-off products to gain speed as well.

The rest is history...

About Damon and Jo:

It’s Damon. It’s Jo. And It’s Damon and Jo. Ok so look, we got tired of all the boring, predictable lifestyle and travel content out there, so we took matters into our own hands and started filming our travels, and adventures around the globe, in 5+ languages.

For its maiden flight, Falcon Heavy’s second stage will attempt to place the payload, Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster, into a precessing Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the Sun. For this first flight test, Falcon Heavy’s two side cores launched the Thaicom 8 satellite (May 2016) and the CRS-9 mission (July 2016). Following booster separation, Falcon Heavy’s two side cores landed at SpaceX’s Landing Zones 1 and 2 (LZ-1 and LZ-2) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Falcon Heavy’s center core attempted to land on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.

많은 영국 남자들이 그렇듯, 스킨케어라는 것 자체가 조니한테는 완전히 생소한 개념이었어요. 그런데 한국 화장품은 점점더 세계적으로 유명해지고 있잖아요! 대부분의 사람들이 한국 로션이나 마스크 팩에 대해서 한번씩은 들어봤을텐데, 아시아에 있는 화장품 가게에 들어가보면 사람들이 그런게 있다는 것도 모르는 다양한 제품들을 찾을 수 있을 거예요!! 그래서 오늘은 미친조니에게 아시아의 최고 미친 뷰티제품들을 소개해줍니다. 즐겁게 봐주셨음 좋겠어요:)

Like many English men, the concept of skincare is completely foreign to Johnny, but Korean skincare treatments are becoming more and more famous around the world! Most people have heard of Korean lotions, face masks and packs, but if you walk into any skincare shop in Asia you'll find a whole variety of treatments that most people have no idea exist!! So today we introduce Michin Johnny to some of Asias most Michin skincare products. Enjoy :)

This is video is very different from what an actual search and rescue mission would be and it's different from the cold case searches I do, but I hope it's still a fun challenge for you. 

You control the camera in this video by moving your phone about or by dragging your mouse on the video on a desktop computer. Also, make sure you video resolution is turned up to the highest setting by clicking on the gear icon in the lower right hand corner of the video.

There were girls on boys, there were girls on girls
Red heels on a table, in a champagne blur
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
We were emptying bottles, we were pushing our luck

And it turned into the longest night of our whole damn lives
Had the wildest times, ooh

It all started with girls on boys, girls on girls
Red heels on the table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard
It all started with a broken heart

It all started with girls on boys
It all started with a broken heart

No, you wouldn't come home, so I stayed out
Hoping I wouldn't see you, with someone in the crowd
It was all kinda empty, so I filled it with rum
It was stupidly crazy, I was comfortably numb

It turned into the longest night of our whole damn lives
Had the wildest times, ooh

It all started with girls on boys, girls on girls
Red heels on the table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard
It all started with a broken heart

It all started with girls on boys
Girls on boys
It all started with girls on boys
Girls on girls
Red heels on the table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

#GringoMovie

About Gringo:
Mild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.

Targeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.

Pursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.
Directed by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.

Lyrics
Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean

Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar

Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound

Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite

If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it

Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night

Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on

Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound

Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite

If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it loud

If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l8HD7WNExhY/sddefault.jpg,0.027145980794373564,0.00030431450340381405,89.20370370370371,0.001983679725891529,0.027450295297777386,0.029433975023668905,2018-01-30,08:00:03,Tuesday,1,8,79,8,28,38,485,3,55,0,0,6,0,2,14,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.126566975666405,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Lyrics:

I saw you lose your mind
You saw me as a silhouette
You needed cigarettes
That’s when you said it’s nice not being here
You don’t have to be a mess
To deal with it
You said that you’re sorry and I don’t need to worry
Oh come on
Why didn’t you tell me
I had to hear it from my wife
You could’ve just told me
I was just outside
And you asked me how to be
Cuz you haven’t been yourself lately
And it’s bothering me
I’ve known you long enough
I can see right through it
You said that you’re sorry
And I don’t need to worry
I hate seeing you like this
Cuz you’re making yourself sick
You’re better than that
Boy you’ve gotta get over it
Why didn’t you tell me
I had to hear it from my wife
You could’ve just told me
I was just outside

Vivo showed a concept phone with a fingerprint reader under the display back at Mobile World Congress (MWC) Shanghai last year. That was made in partnership with Qualcomm and sadly, their collaboration didn’t bear fruit on an actual device.

For the second time around, Vivo is ready to bring this tech forward. This time though, they are with Synaptics which primarily manufactures touchpads for laptops.

Today we did Soju shots with Deadpool wearing a Ryan Reynolds costume on the Han River.

Seriously though, we had that privilege to join Ryan Reynolds on his private boat ride to the Deadpool 2 red carpet event in Seoul. And thanks to my friend's Aunt, got to see what he thinks of some seriously legit Korean food. Korean Alcohol, Korean Anju, the Han River and Deadpool incarnate. We haven't ever laughed this much in an interview.

Variety reports that his been reprimanded for his behavior twice. both related to concerns over work conditions. Is that really a good reason to fire a actor or replace? Keep up great work.

Jeff Kerns - John, Do you think with the recent changes to Movie Pass limiting to 1 viewing per movie cost Avengers IW 20 to 30 million at the BO in its 2nd week? Thanks!

Plus your live Twitter questions!

On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday, April 3rd, 2018) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, and Perri Nemiroff discuss the following:

1) Joaquin Phoenix Responds to The Joker Casting News: ""It Depends... If It Transcends the Genre”

2) The Title of ‘Avengers 4’ Should Scare Marvel Fans, According to the Russo Brothers

3) Rey and Finn Will Be Reunited in ‘Star Wars: Episode IX’

4) ‘Star Trek 4’: Multiple Screenplays Possibly in Development

5) Live Twitter Questions

In a new interview with Fandango, Joaquin Phoenix finally addressed the reports of him playing the Joker in the Todd Phillips directed origin story for WB and DC. Though it doesn’t appear he’s signed on for the movie, he does say however that the conditions have to be right in order for him to sign on.

Avengers: Infinity War drops in less than a month yet we still don’t know the official title for its sequel, Avengers 4. MCU president Kevin Feige has said that the reason the title hasn’t been revealed is that it’s a spoiler for the events of Infinity War. Now directors Anthony and Joe Russo are adding more gas to the fire of speculation. Inverse pointed out a tweet from Twitter user @occmarvel, who said:  “The fact that the Russo Brothers won’t give us the Avengers 4 title because it spoils Infinity War scares the shit outta me,” @occmarvel says. The Russos simply responded: “It should.”.

Friend of the show Ash Crossan moderated a panel with John Boyega at this past weekend’s AwesomeCon where he confirmed to the folks in attendance that his character Finn will be reunited with Daisy Ridley’s Rey chatracter for Star Wars Episode 9.

In a new interview with Spock himself,  Zachary Quinto was speaking to Entertainment Tonight Canada [via a report from Dark Horizons], where he revealed that multiple scripts are being worked on right now for Star Trek 4.

To save their friends, they must break into the legendary Last City, a WCKD-controlled labyrinth that may turn out to be the deadliest maze of all.

Hopefully generation 2 addresses some of these shortcomings to help justify the price tag. At this point I wouldn't recommend buying the Google Pixel Buds.

Thanks for all of your support. This wouldn’t have been possible without you all. Homework EP out now! 

I’ve been playing with this melody for years. Toyed with several different sets of lyrics, played with different meanings of the title, but ultimately settled with these. I wanted it to be sonically bright but thematically melancholy. Sometimes you don’t wanna get out of that hole you’ve made for yourself. Despite better thinking, sometimes it’s fun to wallow in the blues.

Going Nowhere Lyrics:

I’m going nowhere- I can’t move forward. I’m so much colder than I’ve been since the October when we were closer and it was love that we were in. If I was a smarter man, I’d understand I’m alone when I look in the mirror. We said our goodbyes then, but I close my eyes and you’re still here.
 
I’m going nowhere- just getting older watching the whole world pass me by. Against better reason I take memories in, sit back and repeat them every night. And maybe I stay too long, overplay this song, I don’t mind, I’m inclined to agree. If I’m going nowhere then there is nowhereI’d rather be.
 
I wonder if she remembers anything the way that I do her. I wonder if pre-September ever was a way we were. If I’m going nowhere then there is nowhere I’d rather be. I wonder if she remembers anything the way that I do her. I wonder if pre-September ever was a way we were. It’s all a blur.
 
I’m going nowhere- you said it’s over. Still I look forward to the fall. Another October (I’m sorry I know you’re expecting a less than sober call). And maybe you’re right, I’m scared, and my go-nowhere-ing is making it hard to believe that I’m going nowhere and there is nowhere I’d rather be… If you could just show where I can go nowhere, that’s where I’ll be.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lHGxU16sKdg/sddefault.jpg,0.0335699508563606,0.00013843278703653855,242.5,0.0020457289639844037,0.033708383643397136,0.035754112607381545,2017-12-15,18:12:11,Friday,4,7,33,7,17,45,252,3,31,0,1,6,31,0,0,6.0,7.0,"['aa ono', '', ' ', '', 'darren crise / homework ep going nowhere']","['aa', 'ono', 'darren', 'crise', '/', 'homework', 'ep', 'going', 'nowhere']",True,"['aa', 'ono', 'darren', 'crise', '/', 'homework', 'ep', 'go', 'nowher']",9,9,35,1,0,0,0,4.4037395836073205,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Depending on your gaming platform of choice, you might be used to spending anywhere from zero to $60 for a video game. But rare games are often much more valuable.

For instance, Stadium Events is one of the rarest games of all. It was only on the market for a short time before Nintendo bought the rights to it and rebranded it for the Power Pad. Or EarthBound, a classic RPG Nintendo launched to little success on the SNES. Its hero, Ness, would rise to fame later thanks to Super Smash Bros. Nintendo World Championships is a special game cartridge made for a tournament Nintendo held in the 90’s. It contains short sections of a few games and tournament winners got to keep their cart. 

Legend has it that Atari buried a stockpile of E.T. cartridges in the desert because it sold so far below their expectations. Turns out the legend is true, but buying an unearthed cartridge will cost you big bucks. Mario didn’t just star in Super Mario Bros. in 1985. In the rare game Wrecking Crew, the plumber trades a wrench for a hammer as he knocks down walls. The Flintstones had a rare outing in a game that may have been exclusive to video rental stores.

Little Samson is a platformer that lets you swap between four characters on the fly. It has a lot of good ideas, but it came out so late, not many NES owners noticed it. Another late-comer on the NES is TMNT: Tournament Fighters, a fighting game that also happens to be the last game Konami ever made for the console. Bonk’s Adventure is a fun game about a caveman-child with a giant bald head. And Donkey Kong Country got a special limited release for a national tournament put on by Blockbuster.

Watch the video to find out even more about these rare video games you’ll never get to play.

In this video I show you how to ""erase"" light using a red laser and a glow-in-the-dark material. I talk about what happens when you try to charge the brightest glow-in-the-dark material (LIT) with different colors of light. I show you an experiment that actually proves that light is made of photons and not waves. This is a follow-up video to my video about mixing LIT and Black 2.0 (the blackest black).

Julius Randle has had an interesting NBA career so far. He got injured in his first ever NBA game, which really sucked. After coming back, his first couple of seasons had a lot of ups and downs, but he had a breakout season in 2017-18. This is how Julius Randle saved his own career. Enjoy!

Find out how an exhausted screenwriter managed to shove Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain America, Black Panther, Black Widow, Thanos, Tyrion Lannister, Star Lord, Groot, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Shuri, Hulk, Thor and MANY MANY MANY more heroes into a single Marvel movie. Whew. Kind of nuts.

Despite not being able to do so for the past 18 Marvel movies, collecting the 6 Infinity Stones necessary to complete this task is #supereasybarelyaninconvenience. The question now remains, how is Marvel Studios going to top this one?

I appreciate all the support from you guys. I wanted to do an edit of the greatest Minnesota Vikings play I've seen since I have been watching them.

In cinematic style, the video is the final drive from the 2017-2018 NFC divisional playoff game against the NO (New Orleans) Saints. 

A game where Case Keenum throws a high pass to Stefon Diggs and he makes a great catch and spectacular run for a walk-off touchdown win being dubbed the ""The Minneapolis Miracle"" and one of the greatest moments in playoff history.

VERSE 1:
Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me

CHORUS:
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I’m a child of God
Yes I am

VERSE 2:
Free at last
He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me


CHORUS 2:
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I’m a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father’s house
There’s a place for me
I’m a child of God
Yes I am

BRIDGE:
I am chosen
Not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me
Not against me
I am who You say I am

When I was in high school and still unsure of what I wanted to study in college, I stumbled upon Gen Ip's ""Filmography 2010"", a 6-minute mash-up of that year's movies on YouTube. The video sent my imagination reeling, and my appreciation of film as an art form exponentially increased. Though I can't claim this was the sole reason I ultimately decided to study film, it's safe to say Ip's video changed my life in a profound way.

When you take individual works of art - each in turn crafted by so many passionate, creative individuals - and put them all together, you get a vivid look into the collective imagination of our world, the shared dreams and fears of society. I've decided to pay my own homage to this idea with ""Filmography 2017"".",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lLY_lT1R6DQ/sddefault.jpg,0.02454007461726489,0.00032162614177280334,76.3,0.002251382992409623,0.02486170075903769,0.027113083751447317,2017-12-03,22:01:51,Sunday,6,2,32,2,28,16,294,0,67,0,0,1,1,0,0,8.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.342795981578519,2,"['angry', 'angry']",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Hey how’s it going big herc! I enjoy watching all your videos about prison talk and life I learn a lot from your videos.. I’m wondering if Prison really toughens you up? I have couple of friends that served 2 to 5 years in jail and they always come out with the same prison mentality and not feared about going back.. they always tend to tell there jail stories like Rambo and always tells me Jail toughens a lot of people up.. Do you need to go to prison to sharpened your mind and build better aggressiveness if your not good with the hands or if you carry on a lot with conscious and fear?

When it comes to The Lord of the Rings, one of the most common questions circulated online is why didn’t Frodo just ride the giant Eagles to Mount Doom? There are theories out there that suggest this was the plan all along, but sadly, when you look at the evidence, that's just wrong. In fact, it's so wrong, it's dangerous!  In this episode, I will give you the definitive answer to why Frodo didn’t simply ride those giant birds into Mordor!

Species Profile : Velociraptor | Jurassic World Evolution

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

Also, please disregard my hair... -__- It was a natural hair day and I really try to avoid using heat on it when I can!

**I was SO surprised by how well it wore! I applied it at 2:30pm and I didn't have to reapply until around 8. I had lunch and dinner while wearing it, and it faded really nicely without giving me a harsh ring around the inside of my lips. It never got uncomfortable or too dry -- I love this formula!!

В мире есть только три семизвездочных отеля и еще несколько в стадии строительства. В большинстве стран, включая Соединенные Штаты, отели, имеют максимум пять звезд. Те немногие, которые имеют шесть или семь звезд, являются самыми красивыми и самыми роскошными архитектурными чудесами, которые предлагают размещение для туристов. По данным рейтинга отелей, семи-звездочный отель считается синонимом величия, класса и стиля. Эти отели предлагают дополнительную роскошь для гостей, лимузин и частные услуги дворецкого.

Erik Killmonger appears in Black Panther, portrayed by Michael B. Jordan.[5][6] This version is an American black-ops soldier named Erik Stevens who earned the nickname ""Killmonger"".[7] Born N'Jadaka, he is the son of N'Jobu, brother of Wakandan ruler T'Chaka. He lived with his father in Oakland, California in the United States until finding his father dead from a confrontation with T'Chaka and Zuri about stolen vibranium. He is left in Oakland to keep N'Jobu's death a secret. In the present, he works as a black-ops soldier where he has scarifications on his body for every kill he has made. He plots to take the throne from T'Challa and continue his father's plan of providing people of African descent worldwide with Wakandan weaponry, so they may fight back their oppressors. Killmonger kills Ulysses Klaue to gain support of the Border Tribe and challenge King T'Challa to personal combat for the throne. After killing Zuri, Killmonger appears to kill to T'Challa in that duel and becomes King. After ingesting a heart-shaped herb (being T'Challa's cousin, he does not die from the herb as in the comics), he orders the rest incinerated (though Nakia takes one to heal T'Challa) and dons his own black panther suit (It is brown with gold highlights as opposed to black with purple highlights and silver lining, and has been dubbed by the internet as the ""Golden Jaguar"". Like T'Challa's suit in the film, it can absorb kinetic energy-represented in the gold highlights-and release it in a gold shockwave-as opposed to purple-after enough has been amassed. It can also fold into a gold necklace.). However, T'Challa survives and continues the challenge, which officially never concluded. When Killmonger refuses to cooperate, he thus immediately invalidates his claim to the throne and the Royal bodyguard turns against him. In the resulting insurrection, Killmonger's allied Border tribe is defeated and Killmonger himself continues his challenge with T'Challa, taking them into the vibranium mines. At T'Challa's command, Shuri activates the vibranium transport train on the bottom track, the stabilizers disrupting both suits. Killmonger is mortally wounded by T'Challa, and requests to see the sunset over Wakanda that his father told him was more beautiful than anywhere else in the world. T'Challa grants him this request, and offers medical aid. Killmonger declines, knowing that he will

Black Panther is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is intended to be the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is directed by Ryan Coogler from a screenplay by him and Joe Robert Cole, and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a long-time adversary in a conflict that has global consequences.

Wesley Snipes first mentioned his intention to work on a Black Panther film in 1992, with that project going through multiple iterations over the next decade but never coming to fruition. A Black Panther film was announced as one of the ten films based on Marvel characters that would be developed by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures in September 2005, with Mark Bailey hired to write a script in January 2011. Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, with Boseman first appearing in Captain America: Civil War. By the end of 2015, Cole and Coogler had both joined Black Panther, and additional cast members came on board beginning in May 2016. Principal photography for the film took place from January to April 2017, at EUE/Screen Gems Studios and Pinewood Atlanta Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and Busan, South Korea.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lQr3kTZ6onI/sddefault.jpg,0.013492430894536635,0.0005584779088214798,24.15929203539823,0.0016078892006187735,0.014050908803358115,0.01565879800397689,2018-03-23,16:01:17,Friday,4,11,51,11,39,87,441,4,93,1,0,9,0,0,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.9420544424817767,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Lyrics:

So you say you're feeling jealous 
With out it you don’t know what Love is 
When I messed up, I know I know 
Persuing all my nerves to phone you 

Was so in shock when I first read it
That day I never will forget it 
I’ve sewn it up inside my bones
And in my heart I know I know
It’s real 

Like when I dream so vividly 
But in my heart I know it's real
From your locks down to your feet 
And how I’m never forgetting 
How my life was incomplete 
And in the dark I found you 
And now we got this sympathy

So you say you're feeling reckless 
Went out and bought another necklace 
To cover up bruises on ya 
Well what about the ones I loaned ya 

So you’ve never made an edit 
Not done enough that you’d regret it 
Well I don’t need a change to know 
That there is space for love to grow it’s real 


Like when I dream so vividly 
But in my heart I know it real
From your locks down to your feet 
And how I’m never forgetting 
How my life was incomplete 
And in dark I found you 
And now we got this sympathy 

Like when I dream so vividly 
But in my heart I know it real
From your locks down to your feet 
And how I’m never forgetting 
How my life was incomplete 
And in dark I found you 
And now we got this sympathy 


Like when I dream so vividly 
But in my heart I know it real
From your locks down to your feet 
And how I’m never forgetting 
How my life was incomplete 
And in dark I found you 
And now we got this sympathy",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTADFIsuzto/sddefault.jpg,0.01065479927613842,0.0001846585663108912,57.7,0.0004985781290394062,0.010839457842449312,0.011338035971488716,2018-04-27,04:03:10,Friday,4,9,73,9,46,58,454,6,80,1,0,6,5,0,13,6.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.53679533030079,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

About The Opposition w/ Jordan Klepper:
In a TV news landscape where it’s impossible to know whom to trust, one man rises above the partisan hackery of the mainstream media to bring you the only truth that matters: his. From the fringe-friendly mind of Jordan Klepper, this is The Opposition.

Seeing a pair of twins in the street is often enough to make us do a double take. And despite the fact that twins are slowly becoming more and more common as the world’s population grows, we still see them as something of a strange phenomenon. But if you find the concept of two identical people strange, wait until you hear about these even rarer types of twins. From the pair who were born two months apart, to the twins who have a different mom or a different dad, there are some identical siblings who are just a bit stranger than the rest. And then there are the twins that seriously defy nature - either by sharing the same strange birth defects or existing in a way that 21st century doctors didn’t think was possible.

Whether you just want to see the New Razer phone reviewed from the inside, or youve already broken your Razer phone, and need to fix something, this video will show how I disassemble my own Razer Phone and assemble it again in working condition.

This video will show a Razer phone screen repair, Charging port replacement and how to remove the Razer phone Battery. For some reason Razer spells their brand with an E instead of an O like a normal Razor. But o well. Still a fun project.

The scientists behind the cloning said the monkeys would be useful for studying diseases, including cancers and immune disorders.
But critics said the research raised ethical concerns and could potentially bring the world closer to human cloning.

In fact Japan has over 300 brands of beef, all with that amazing marbling and leanness you'd expect from premium graded A5 beef. 
Every 5 years, Japan holds the Wagyu Olympics and Tottori Wagyu won the ""best beef"" competition this year. 
Could Tottori prefecture have the new no.1 wagyu steaks - even better than Kobe or Matsuzaka!? 
On a mission to find out, I traveled across Japan to Tottori Prefecture and the Mt. Daisen area near Yonago city to see if and what makes their beef so very tasty. 

Mt. Daisen is called the Mt. Fuji of the west -  and it looks it! 
It has a history long history as a wagyu marketplace and the fertile grass and clean water and air lead to a great environment for the cattle. Ranch owners also make sure wagyu live stress free lives and care for them like children. They're very proud of the wagyu cattle. 

THE PRINCIPLE OF ITADAKIMASU
But how do you love an animal like family - then eat it?
In Japan, people way ITADAKIMASU before eating - like saying grace at the dinner table with your family - and after learning about the deep meaning of the word, it makes sense why Japan in general has amazing food everywhere! Japanese really respect the food, the ingredients and show an amazing amount of respect and gratitude for the sacrifice required to cook to food. After 20 years, I had no idea just how deep the meaning of Itadakimasu was to people in Japan. Now, I have an entirely new way to see my food and I hope this segment of the video leaves a lasting impact on the way you see food too. 

WAYS TO EAT JAPANESE WAGYU BEEF

★ Yakiniku
★ Sukiyaki
★ Nigiri Sushi
★ Shabu Shabu 

KOBE BEEF vs TOTTORI WAGYU
I tried both and to be honest, I have to say that I didn't taste a really big difference between Kobe and Daisen Kuroushi beef in the taste, not enough to pay 300% more for dinner. 
On the flip side, eating Kobe Beef is an experience in itself, trying the most selective beef in the world. If that interests you, the experience is worth it.

But maybe you don't want to be miserable, maybe you want to know how to live happy, maybe you want to know how to avoid depression and misery.. Well then, you can also use this video as a anti-guide. A anti-guide that can help you identify and remove some of the habits and rituals you are already doing, some which are making you miserable even though you try your best to live fulfilled and satisfied.

ENJOY.

Toyota revealed the 2019 Avalon at the 2018 Detroit Auto Show but the biggest news is not necessarily the arrival of an all-new full-size sedan but rather the arrival of Apple CarPlay to Toyota. As the first Toyota with CarPlay the Avalon will offer buyers modern smartphone integration. Elsewhere the 2019 Avalon delivers improved interior space, improved ride and handling, and two powertrains to choose from including a V6 teamed with an 8-speed automatic transmission and a 4-cylinder hybrid.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lWE7RBc73vE/sddefault.jpg,0.018330268635970558,0.00013030996660642574,140.66666666666666,0.00037250222777392405,0.01846057860257698,0.0188330808303509,2017-12-12,09:35:01,Tuesday,1,9,38,9,33,47,334,0,79,0,1,9,14,3,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.319290046343879,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

In this episode of electronic basics we will have a closer look at strain gauges and load cells and find out how we can use them to measure weight. Along the way we will talk about the wheatstone bridge, suitable amplifier circuits and how we can use a µC to output the measured values of our weight measuring system.

What is ASMR? Here’s my definition: https://youtu.be/qAEM95ixp-s

Remember!
ASMR is not a medical treatment. ASMR is meant to induce tingles, relaxation, and sleep. Although it may make you feel better, it has not been proven to fix any mental health issues or conditions you may have. If you need help, PLEASE seek a professional. Here are a few links that can help you:

Check out ""10 Shocking Disney Pixar Theories That Actually Make Sense"" from our friends at CBR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0r87Bf3OTc

Pixar is Disney’s baby they began taking care of in 2006. Since then, the word has flown around the industry that Pixar made Disney better when their head chief creative officer, John Lasseter, went over to help Disney. But it was also said that Pixar suffered and reverted to more sequels, however, their sequels turned out to be just as good as the originals. Take “Finding Dory” or “Toy Story 2” for examples.

Despite Disney buying the major animation studio, Pixar still isn’t afraid to say no to them. Pixar has a core Brain Trust that all their ideas go through and they won’t be compromising any of their stories for a “Mulan,” “Aladdin,” or “Frozen” style film. Instead, Pixar is going to continue making outside the box, conflict-driven, flawed character leading films such as “Up,” “Wall-E,” “Toy Story,” “Inside Out,” “The Incredibles,” ""Brave,"" ""Cars,"" and “Monsters Inc.” Not to mention that both the major studios take time to make cool little short films before their actual features, but Disney can’t even hold a candle to Pixar’s originality in those.

So what has made Pixar so consistently successful over the years? Is it their small, closed group of in-house writers? Is it the time they take for the proper story, like the ten years it took “The Incredible 2” to be made? Is it their knowledge that Chinese food creates conflict? Is it their no-fear at tackling new worlds like that of “Coco”? It’s all these things and way more! Watch this video to discover all the crazy, fearless, and risk-taking things that Pixar does that Disney would NEVER do! You’ll be shocked at the differences and thrilled to watch the newest Pixar film!

******************* ABOUT THE VIDEO ***********************

An awesome fan sent us this great big magnet.  Before we totally destroyed it, we had a little fun with it.  We did a pull-up suspended by a magnet.  We extracted iron from cereal.  We tried to show the poles of the magnet with iron shavings.  Then of course we tried to cut it with the waterjet.  What do you think is going to happen?  Magnet will explode? or all hold together?

An introduction into reverse-engineering x86 microcode and writing it yourself

Microcode is an abstraction layer on top of the physical components of a CPU and present in most general-purpose CPUs today. While it is well-known that CPUs feature a microcode update mechanism, very little is known about its inner workings given that microcode and the update mechanism itself are proprietary and have not been throughly analyzed yet. We close this gap by both analyzing microcode and writing our own programs for it. This talk will give an insight into our results and how we achieved them, including live demos of what we can do and technical details.

Given the complexity of modern instruction sets hardware vendors moved to hardware designs incorporating complex decode units. A single instruction of the complex outwardfacing instruction set is translated to multiple instructions of the simpler internal architecture. While it is possible to do this translation in hardware alone, some instructions would require huge amounts of space on the silicon and increase costs. These complex instructions are instead decoded using a software-like approach called microcode. While processing such an instruction, the CPU internally evaluates a sequence of operations, micro-ops, which decode the complex instruction into the corresponding simpler operations that are performed by the hardware.

In the light of the existence of hardware bugs such as the infamous Pentium fdiv bug, hardware vendors developed a process to fix those errors without requiring a CPU replacement. However the microcode is stored in a ROM on the CPU die and can not be changed after production. Also relatively simple or often used instructions are still decoded in hardware. The update is instead achieved using microcode updates, which intercept certain instructions and replace their faulty implementation with a new, fixed version. These updates are applied either by the BIOS/UEFI or the operating system during early bootup. While the update process is well documented, the Linux kernel offers a module for it, and the updates are provided by the CPU vendors, the actual semantics of microcode are proprietary.

Most update mechanisms are protected by signatures or other cryptographic primitives. However there were some indications that older CPU models (until around 2013) do not have a strong cryptographic protection and thus would accept custom updates. Given this chance we started to analyze the behavior of the CPU given our own updates and used these observations to infer the semantics of microcode. After some time we reverse-engineered enough of the semantics to write our own microcode programs. These programs range from very simple proof of concepts to stealthy backdoors and defensive primitives.

As an additional approach we also performed hardware analysis. By delayering the CPU and imaging it with both an optical and an electron microscope we could locate and read out the ROM containing the microcode. After processing and reordering the physical connections we retrieved the hardwired microcode of the CPU. This gave us more information on what can be done with microcode and allowed more insights into the intended behavior than our reverse-engineering approach.

In this talk we will first start with a (short) crash course in CPU architecture and where microcode is used in practice. We will then cover our reverse engineering methods and how we were able to discover the semantics of x86 microcode. We then demonstrate, also with live demos, this knowledge with multiple microcode programs that implement both defensive measures as well as provide an attacker with hard to detect backdoors. Lastly we will discuss security problems and possible solutions to protect against them. We also provide example microcode programs for your own CPUs (use at your own risk) and a kernel patch to apply them on a Linux system. Also we will have some systems with us so you can try your hand at writing some microcode yourself.

Twitch is the world’s leading social video platform and community for gamers, video game culture, and the creative arts. Each day, close to 10 million visitors gather to watch and talk about video games with more than 2 million streamers.

Dota 2 is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare.

Galaxy Battles II: Emerging Worlds is the second series of Galaxy Battles. The event will be held at Manila, Philippines, where eight teams will compete for their chance at the $500,000 USD prize pool.
The event was initially planned to be part of the Dota Pro Circuit but lost its Major status on January 4th. As a result, several high profile teams withdrew from the tournament, reducing the number of participating teams from sixteen to eight.

The Kardashians v West Family Feud episode has finally aired and it gave us some pretty incredible moments we did not know we needed.

How has the world gone this long without a Family Feud episode with the Kardashians?
It was an episode filled with shocking and dramatic moments, but is anyone really surprised? After all, it is the Kardashians and Kanye West. The most highly anticipated episode of Celebrity Family Feud FINALLY made its debut and it was probably the best episode to kick off the new season.

As you all know, the episode featured Team West aka Kanye, Kim and three of Kanye’s cousins and they were all up against Team Kardashian, which consisted of Khloe, Kris, Kendall, MJ – Kris’ mom, Cici -- Kris’ cousin, and of course, Jonathan Cheban. And you guys, trust me when I say this episode gave us some pretty killer moments.

First of all, we just have to acknowledge that Steve Harvey was NOT lying when he said Kanye was grinning from ear to ear throughout the entire episode. So all that smiling from yay was a great moment overall. At one point Kanye even joked around and revealed why he and Kim lock their bedroom at night.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw_hhUXc4lg
TBH, this might’ve been the most Kanye has ever smiled in his entire life.

Anyway, while Kanye gave a pretty hilarious answer to the question of ‘If you had a wild party and everybody’s naked, who is someone you would hate to see show up,” I think we can all agree that Kendall gave a much better answer when she said this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjXy4leMloI
Sorry, Yeezy!
Kim and Khloe’s rivalry throughout the entire episode was definitely a major highlight. As we saw in previous promos, things got feisty pretty quickly between Keeks and Koko. It was that very moment when Khloe straight up dissed Kim on the podium that Kim decided to show her little sister no mercy.
When Kim basically destroyed Khloe during their face-off, she said and we QUOTE, “That’s what she gets for that attitude.” Ooo, something tells me their relationship was never the same after that moment.

But, Khloe redeemed herself later on in the night when she and Kendall selflessly gave up their spots so that Kim and Kanye could play the Fast Money round since their team didn’t win – shocking, I know. But as Khloe put it, QUOTE “Kim and Kanye were dying to do this and they really thought they were gonna win. As sisters, Kendall and I are deciding to let them play Fast Money.” And if that wasn’t a super heartwarming and beautiful moment on the show, then I don’t know what is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxbV5wGpXc8
And of course, Kanye fulfilling his life long dream and winning $25,000 for the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles was pretty great too.

Hi A.R.M.Ys! ☜(˚▽˚)☞  I'm back with another video ʘ‿ʘ 
----------------------
BTS 'You Laugh = You Lose' Challenge (I totally didn't steal that name from Pewds lmao)  or just BTS 'Try Not To Laugh' Challenge.
I feel like many of you really enjoy these types of videos, so I decided to make another one. I tried really hard to make this video entertaining, so I hope that some of you will appreciate it.  In this video I included only funny moments from DNA 'era', so everything in this video is quite 'new'.
----------------------
DISCLAIMER: By making this video I didn't mean to mock or laugh at BTS in any way. It's just for fun, so don't take it too seriously :)

Designed in Frankfurt and road tested in Germany over its development, the 2018 Stinger looks to completely change your perception of Kia. No longer will the brand settle for being known to offer safe, stylish, and value packed cars. Passion and performance is one area where Kia needed to address and thanks to a team coming from Audi and BMW, the 2018 Stinger is graced with a balanced rear-drive chassis, standard turbo power, and an interior that wouldn't feel out of place in a luxury car. The 2018 Kia Stinger is a must drive if you want all the performance, looks, and handling of a German sport sedan but want to keep an additional $10,000 dollars in your bank account with very little sacrifices.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/laDTa-5sQds/sddefault.jpg,0.00768378043742277,0.0005670456733480433,13.55054945054945,0.002490639072936405,0.008250826110770814,0.01074146518370722,2017-11-16,03:49:51,Thursday,3,7,24,7,19,37,199,1,43,1,3,4,12,0,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.7708428741832325,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'car': 1},1

[Verse 1]
We burned and we bled, we try to forget
But the memories left are still haunting
The walls that we built from bottles and pills
We swallow until we're not talking

[Refrain]
I... I am a man on fire
You... a violent desire

[Pre-Chorus]
What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove

[Verse 2]
Started a stranger, a lover in danger
The edge of a knife
The face of an angel, the heart of a ghost
Was it a dream?

[Refrain]
I... I am a man on fire
You... a violent desire

[Pre-Chorus]
What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Refrain]
I... I am a man on fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
You... a violent desire

[Pre-Chorus]
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove

[Chorus]
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

What are Cole & Marmalade like at the vet? This is a question we often get asked, well this is what they're like…

Marm has quite the reputation at vets because of his CATITUDE, when he was going through chemo treatments every week, I sometimes had to go into the room alone and put a mask on him so he couldn't bite the vet techs! … Poor lil guy as been through so much in his short time here on earth :(

Cole's not fond of vet visits either and he's very vocal at times, but his hisses are just empty threats… We do our best to calm the boys down prior to vet visits, we leave the carriers out so they get used to them, use Feliway wipes and Rescue Remedy, but as you can see these have minimal effect on them unfortunately.

We also wipe down Marmalade with a blanket Cole as been using to get the horrible vet scent off of him in the hopes that Cole will be more friendly when he sees his brother again… but in reality it doesn't work that well and it always takes a little time for Cole to feel at ease with his brother back in the house after being gone all day.

The best street food we found in Oaxaca was definitely our final two meals in the local market, made by the most friendly and amazing locals, the Oaxacan Mole over top of JUICY chicken and BBQ beef and pork! The chicken was so juicy, plump, and very delicious.

We started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico City, eating a ton of delicious street food in Parts 1 through 4  on our Mexican street food playlist here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHnqNOvDi44&list=PL903FZ5cNRa3m9fJD4DANjuJSS6z1f20R

After this, we traveled to Oaxaca in search of the most famous Mole Poblano and Oaxacan street food specialties, but we found so much more. The first thing we did was explore the street food scene in search of a local Mexican breakfast. We would have happily eaten tacos or any other Mexican street food, but we found one of the most famous street foods in Oaxaca, the Memela. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, there is so many variations and the extreme deliciousness of the cuisine makes your mouth come alive!

After that amazing Mexican breakfast, we visited a local market to try out a second breakfast, and had an amazing stuffed Empanada, with another one of Oaxacas famous 7 Moles!

After exploring the first Mexican Market, we went to another even bigger and better street food market in Oaxaca, the Mercado 20 de noviembre, also known as the Mercado viente de noviembre or the 20th of November market. We found a ton of the best street food I’ve ever tried in Mexico, like amazing BBQ beef and pork covered in SPICY salsa!

After enjoying the best BBQ in Oaxaca, we found a Mexican restaurant selling all of the famous Oaxacan foods, serving a huge variety of Mole, delicious Tlayudas (Kind of like Mexican Pizza!), Tamales, and more!

Here are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:

1) Oaxacan Memelas with delicious spicy Salsa - 
2) Amazing Mexican Empanada stuffed with Yellow Mole sauce (A Oaxaca specialty!) - Inside the Mercado de la Merced in downtown Oaxaca.
3) Chapulines Grasshoppers - Outside of the Mercado 20 de Noviembre
4) Spicy and Delicious Mexican BBQ - Inside the Mercado 20 de Noviembre
5) Mole Sauce and Almendrado Mole Sauce over top of juicy chicken, flavoured with rich and dark chocolate with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Inside the Mercado 20 de Noviembre

Aw wow, it's all come to an end. The final music video from 'Aunty Donna - The Album'. This one is all about the awkward moment one experiences when one walks in on someone while they are doing a shit (or, poop) in the toilet/bathroom. Featuring the amazing singing of one Michelle Brasier, who also helped a great deal with the topline melody. She's does live comedy shows and you should check them out. Fun fact about this song: it's the fucking stupidest thing we've ever created.

LETRA:

Envolvimento diferente eu ensino a vocês 
Eu vou sentar e vou quicar
E vou descendo de uma vez 

Esse hit é chiclete na tua mente vai ficar
Sento, sento, sento, sento
E quico devagar (3x) 

Tu não precisa exagerar
Muito menos se empolgar 

Tu vai sentar, tu vai sentar, tu vai sentar devagar (3x) 

O nosso bonde é sinistro 
Vem cá que eu vou te ensinar 
A descer, a subir, a quicar e rebolar (4x ) 
A quicar e rebolar (2x) 

E ae, DJ 
Escama só de peixe  
Uai

Black Panther synopsis: After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.

Tey, tey, tey

Hoje, você vai embora
Só se eu deixar
Hoje, embaixo do lençol
O bicho vai pegar

Te pego de jeito
E se pegar fogo
Deixa queimar
Te beijo gostoso
Eu tiro sua roupa
Te levo pro Paraíso

E eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou
Te levo pro Paraíso
E eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou
Direto pro Paraíso

Te levo pro Paraíso
Direto pro Paraíso

Diz o que cê quer de mim
Provocou e eu quero, sim
A noite toda, a noite toda
Sim, sabe que eu gosto assim
Hoje eu vou até o fim

Me chama, implora o meu amor
Me chama, implora o meu amor
Me acende, que eu quero sentir calor
Me chama, implora o meu amor

Se me chama, eu vou
Se me chama, eu vou

Me chama, implora o meu amor
Me acende, que eu quero sentir calor
Me chama, implora o meu amor
(Eu vou!)

E eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou
Te levo pro Paraíso
E eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou, e eu vou

Discover The 4 Emotions You Need To Make a Killer First Impression:
http://bit.ly/2IBKpCr

In this video  we have three tips to achieve success and improvement as shown by Elon Musk!  In five hundred years, we may look back and say, ""Elon Musk was the single most influential person of our entire century."" He has been able to do more in his 46 years than most of us could hope to do in ten lifetimes and yes, part of that is because Elon is incredibly smart and he works incredibly hard. ...and we're so hot up; we had just one computer so the website was up during the day and I was coding at night. ...work hard like it mean every waking hour; that's the thing I would say if your particular if you're starting a company. But working 100 hours a week still only puts you at two-and-a-half times as much as the average employee. 

And most geniuses do not make the international impact that Elon has. In fact, the man with the highest IQ in the world, Chris Langan is a bouncer. So while smarts and work ethic are critical to Elon's success, in order to impact the world, you simply have to be able to influence other people; there's no way around it. That includes employees investors and the public at large and Elon Musk is unique here because on this channel, we can normally point to a leader's ability to nail a public speech. 

02:15 Elon perseveres despite a lot of failures
05:05 Elon has a vision that inspires

00:47 Round the world record breakers
05:50 Star Sailors League
12:12 Volvo Ocean Race Leg 3 & 4 
19:15 Rolex Sydney Hobart
How fast can one person sail around the world? Last year we thought we knew, but 12 months later when Francois Gabart smashed the previous record, the sailing world drew breath. Was this the ultimate limit to the ultimate challenge?
To find out, we looked at the history of round the world record breaking and talked exclusively to Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first man to sail solo, non-stop, around the world about how times have tumbled and what lies ahead.
In addition, we go to Nassau in the Bahamas to witness an extraordinary victory as the world’s best compete in a champion of champions showdown.
We also re-visit the grueling Volvo Ocean Race as the fleet careers though the Southern Ocean before parking up in the Pacific.
Plus, we take a look at the controversy in the Rolex Sydney Hobart race.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lj9DFRmCdnU/sddefault.jpg,0.004102596595161629,0.00021780194279332968,18.83636363636364,0.00013464120099951292,0.0043203985379549606,0.0044550397389544714,2018-01-29,09:29:10,Monday,0,7,53,7,45,38,431,1,89,0,2,5,37,1,4,5.0,7.0,"['K VOR Leg3&4 —', 'Rolex Sydney-Hobart —', '', 'a Tae : =']","['K', 'VOR', 'Leg3&4', '—', 'Rolex', 'Sydney-Hobart', '—', 'a', 'Tae', ':', '=']",True,"['K', 'vor', 'leg3', '&', '4', '—', 'rolex', 'sydney-hobart', '—', 'a', 'tae', ':', '=']",13,12,36,3,1,1,1,6.749672311217503,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'airplane': 1},1

We finally got around to giving our lobby (another) extreme makeover by hanging up all the art we've been collecting. The 2nd round of Spring cleaning unearthed our collection of forgotten vehicles from our past adventures. As is our Spring equinox ritual, we took our various wheels for a spin, broke a bunch of stuff, and got hurt. To our surprise however, the most damage was done not by a sporting good, but by an underestimated condiment.

The following is for those multicultural:

Ngesikhathi esilandelayo lapho othile ekhononda ngokuthi wenze iphutha, mtshele ukuthi kungenzeka ukuthi into enhle. Ngoba ngaphandle kokungapheleli, nawe noma mina ngeke sibe khona.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

I choose me, and I know that’s selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can’t thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I’m with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin' I can’t explain
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I’ll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I’ll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin' I can’t explain
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
I can’t stop cryin', I hate that I’ve caused you pain
But I can’t deny it, I just don’t feel the same
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train

Marge Simpson is typically the anchor of The Simpsons family, but she has hidden some dark truths over the years. Along with drinking and gambling problems, the internet has been full of some crazy theories about the mother to Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

Let’s dive deep into the world of The Simpsons and look at some of these dark theories involving the infamous blue-haired character. Marge may be in every single episode of The Simpsons, but a troubling theory popped up that some viewers have noticed. Marge has no true friends. Not only does she not have friends, but Homer may be blackmailing her to stay married and enjoy the life she loves. One of the biggest mysteries in The Simpsons was “Who Shot Mr. Burns”, but one theory points to Marge rather than Maggie. Through the years, we’ve seen how superficial Marge can be, almost to the point of social anxiety. Marge claims to love Homer, but she has been a big tease over the years, hinting at relationships with numerous characters. One of the toughest things Marge has ever gone through was dealing with Bart’s Death, in a rumored episode that was cut from production and never actually aired. In one episode Marge loses her hair due to extreme stress, but there may have been a deeper and real-life disease behind this condition. Marge’s childhood was not only not the greatest, but it involved a lot of abuse along the way. Marge was caught shoplifting, but her actions may have not been the first time she swiped and stole items. Watch to see all these theories and several others!

HOW TO Test If A Motor Armature With Commutator Is Damaged #ElectricMotor,The LabOtomy,26.0,2017-11-30 13:00:07+00:00,"['DIY', 'HOW TO', 'repair', 'broken', 'electric motor', 'diagnose', 'test', 'armature', 'DC motor', 'universal motor', 'commutator', 'windings', 'electric motors', 'commutator bars', '180 degrees test', 'bar to bar test', 'continuity test', 'insulating material', 'mica', 'winding coils', 'lamination', 'eddy currents', 'stacked lamination', 'tutorial', 'TheLabOtomy', 'ODeparis', '诊断', '电动机', '修理', '电机电枢', 'diagnosticar', 'motor eléctrico', 'reparación', 'armadura del motor', 'निदान', 'विद्युत मोटर', 'मरम्मत', 'मोटर आर्मेचर', 'تشخيص', 'محرك ك']",1867832.0,8474.0,1148.0,281.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lmjFzukDhqI/default.jpg,"When an electric motor is broken, one suspect is the armature with commutator of the motor. In this video, we show different tests (180 degrees test, bar-to-bar test, continuity ""bar to stack"" test) that can be completed to determine whether or not the problem with the motor is caused by the armature with commutator being damaged or having failed. Note that those tests apply to DC motors and universal motors that use a motor armature with commutator.

In my case, the armature, coming from an old circular saw, was found to be faulty. Was it a surprise? No. Other signs of the armature having failed included:
1) Motor not reaching full speed when using the circular saw
2) Smoke coming from the armature when using the circular saw
3) Motor not spinning at all when placing the motor brushes on A specific commutator bar (the one where the resistance drop in test #2 was observed)
4) Irregular film left by the brushes on the commutator bars

Cause of the motor failure? Short in the armature windings. 
But ultimately because I'm an ass!
- Short in the armature windings was because the coils got too warm
- The coils got too warm because the tool had to draw too much power
- The tool drew too much power because I pushed an old saw (with possibly degraded winding insulation) into cutting off wood that was too thick, too fast and on a super-hot summer day, so ultimately, the tool failed because I'm an ass.

The London Chess Classic is a 10-player round-robin taking place from December 1st to 11th at Google HQ in London, for Round 1, and then at the Olympia Conference Centre in Kensington. The event is the 5th and final leg of the Grand Chess Tour and features World Champion Magnus Carlsen, other tour regulars Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura, Wesley So, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Sergey Karjakin, as well as English wild card Mickey Adams.

The prize fund is $300,000 (about €280,000) with a first prize of $75,000, plus another $100,000 and $50,000 respectively for the top two in the overall 2017 Grand Chess Tour standings. Players receive 100 minutes for 40 moves then 60 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second delay from move 1. In the event of a tie for first, a tiebreak match (10 mins + 5 seconds delay) will be played, beginning 30 minutes after the end of the last classical game. If still tied, up to 2 mini matches (5 min, 3-sec delay) will follow and finally an Armageddon game (5 min vs. 4 min). Official websites: www.londonchessclassic.com | grandchesstour.org

Thaddeus is a young teenager with a major crush, like many boys his age.

But unlike his peers, Thaddeus also has a stutter, which also makes approaching the object of his affection that much harder.

But when Thaddeus finds himself in a unique position to impress the girl of his dreams, he comes up with an ingenious solution -- one that comes with its own set of complications.

This well-acted warm-hearted teen drama is a story about first love, but while its subject matter is iconic and touching, the unique ""obstacle"" is stuttering, a speech pattern that can make young people especially fearful and self-conscious in social situations.

But ""Audible Static"" comes by its hardship honestly -- both director Sai Selvarajan and lead actor Parker Baze, who was 12 years old at the time of filming, both grew up with stutters. This experience makes the film's remarkable portrayal both authentic and compassionate.

But you don't need to have a stutter to relate to a story about summoning up the courage to approach a crush -- and coming up with a way around and through fear. Charming and warm-hearted, you'll find it hard not to root for Thaddeus -- and be impressed by the lengths he'll go to get the girl.

Brie Larson's Captain Marvel, the newest character set to join the MCU, and a probable leader for the next generation of superheroes set to light up our screens.  First off, it's all set to be a period piece taking place in the '90s, with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appearing in his pre-eyepatch form, potentially with an explanation as to what actually happened there. 

Furthermore, Captain Marvel will be facing off against the Skrulls in the film, an alien race of shape-shifting green creatures; intriguing since they're traditionally seen as Fantastic Four villains, and so would presumably be under the ownership of Fox.

The superhero name Captain Marvel has a long and tangled history. New Line Cinema is preparing to start filming DC Comics’ Shazam! (who was actually the first Captain Marvel), and Marvel Studios also has their own Captain Marvel movie scheduled for March 8, 2019. Even within Marvel, there have been multiple heroes called Captain Marvel, but the MCU Captain Marvel will be Carol Danvers (previously Ms. Marvel), to be played by Brie Larson. 

We’ve known for a while that Captain Marvel would be something of an MCU prequel, as it will be set in the 1990s, feature the alien race the Skrulls as villains, and also Samuel L. Jackson as a younger Nick Fury. As a just-before-Thanksgiving shocker, the news broke that Jude Law will be the male lead in Captain Marvel, and he’s playing “Dr. Walter Lawson.” That right there is sort of a big deal, because that’s the name that the Kree alien named “Mar-Vell” took when he arrived on Earth. And rather coincidentally, Mar-Vell was a Captain. Mar-Vell has been right up there with Adam Warlock as one of the cosmic characters Marvel fans most want to see in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Are you excited for Captian Marvel?

Following is the transcript of the video:

Robert Wright: In real mindfulness meditation, calm isn’t the only object of the game. I mean, it's good. Calm is better than not calm by and large. but the point of having a calm mind is then you can start examining other things that are going on.

You just get a finer view of things and you often see beauty in things you wouldn’t have seen it in.

Now when you turn your attention to what's inside your mind, that's when things can get more therapeutic, in a way. Because one thing you can look as problematic feelings. You’ll feel a feeling surface and the fact that your mind is calm will let you examine the feeling rather than get carried away by it.

So like a feeling of anxiety that might have triggered just a train of unpleasant thoughts and like disaster scenarios won't do that because you're not blindly following it. Instead, you're observing it. And that is the way you handle things inside your head, in general in mindfulness meditation. Thoughts, feelings, etc. Doesn't mean the feelings go away necessarily but it does give you the option of changing your relationship to the unpleasant feelings in ways that not only take some of the unpleasantness out of them but gives you an actual clearer view of the world.

Because face it, anxiety very often gets you to come up with thoughts that are kind of semi-crazy. You know, you're just exaggerating the chances that things will go wrong, you're imagining people are thinking about you, thinking unpleasant things about you. When in fact they just don't care about you that much, they’re probably not thinking about you at all. So it can be very clarifying exercise and is that’s the whole premise of Buddhism. Is that we don't by nature see the world clearly and so meditation is one of the disciplines in Buddhism that helps you see things more clearly.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lpWkKts-nEY/sddefault.jpg,0.02280638174140968,0.0008933763727233653,25.52830188679245,0.0018204650613985558,0.023699758114133045,0.0255202231755316,2017-11-19,00:00:03,Sunday,6,8,18,8,18,44,192,0,49,0,1,8,8,5,0,5.0,10.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.659820128491062,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 5},5

From Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television, A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE! is inspired by the holiday classic feature “A Christmas Story” and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway production “A Christmas Story: The Musical.” Marc Platt (“Grease: Live,” “La La Land,” “Wicked”) and Adam Siegel (“Grease: Live”) will executive-produce, with Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary (“Grease: Live,” “Anything but Love,” “Ira & Abby”) serving as co-executive producers and writers. Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “La La Land”) who composed the original score to “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” will compose several new songs for the LIVE television event on FOX.

Two-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick (“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “The Producers,” “Manchester by the Sea”) will star as the narrator where he will play the grown-up “Ralphie Parker,” who looks back with love and humor on his favorite childhood Christmas. Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker."" Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.

In this video I show, how to build the most beautiful match house ever. But one is not enough! Let's build a small town with different houses and a clock tower. This is match art. But nothing lasts forever and, after all, matches are made for burning, so I set it on fire and burn it down. As you can see, the result is spectacular. It's like an amazing fire domino chain reaction.

Photos and video obtained by AP from a resident showed turbulent water rushing down Main Street in Ellicott City, some 13 miles (20 kilometers) west of Baltimore.
