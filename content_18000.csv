Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MbdATElT85o/sddefault.jpg,0.011826263197261794,0.00028953835866219493,40.845238095238095,0.0003963918005494335,0.01211580155592399,0.012512193356473423,2018-03-27,05:50:52,Tuesday,1,7,35,7,30,45,306,2,73,0,1,6,14,2,0,6.0,8.0,['al'],['al'],True,['al'],1,1,2,0,0,0,0,5.4935986221687845,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Donald Glover, AKA Childish Gambino, has taken over all forms of media from music, television, and even film. This talented individual is the creator of the series “Atlanta,” which he wrote, directs, and stars in. Not to mention his hit songs, “This is America,” “3005,” “Redbone,” and “Sweatpants” to name a few. He has accolades a plenty, Emmy’s, Grammy’s, and even a Golden Globe. Maybe he’ll take home an Oscar one of these years now that he’s making a splash into the cinematic realm with major movies like “The Lion King,” in which he will play Simba, and “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” in which he will play Lando Calrissian. So it’s obvious, nothing is stopping this talented dude, but what is behind all the work and fame that we don’t know?

Could it be that he has a secret album from 2005, but actually started making his “real” music in 2008? Is it the fact that he grew up in a religious Jehovah's Witness household that bred his curiosity of the world? Or potentially his first job writing on “30 Rock” for Tina Fey influenced his comedic ways even more? How did he land his role of Troy on “Community” by creating one of the first ever internet viral videos, “Bro Rape” by Derrick Comedy with his friends from New York University? Perhaps by keeping his family life a secret with his son Legend and partner Michelle that makes his such a renaissance man? But the solo fact that Kanye West has said to him that he wants to be Donald Glover makes us sold on this dude. And to make him even cooler, he was born on a Californian Air Force base...come on?! Does it get any cooler, that’s right...it doesn’t. So how does Carlton Banks from “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” and writing his fears on hotel paper factor into all this...you’ll just have to watch and see...

Watch this video to find out the secrets about Donald Glover that will shock you! Wait until you find out what Kanye West said about him at the end of the video?

'Twilight'은 황혼이 질 때 시간이 짧게 느껴지듯, 헤어질 때의 아쉬운 마음을 서정적으로 표현함과 동시에
미래에 대한 두려움과 사랑이란 감정 사이에서 흔들리는 청춘의 마음을 나타낸다.

Paroles:

Je me fais la nique, les mains dans le blouson
Tout mon corps me pique - c’est la salaison
Quand ils loadent leur bras, elles rient de bonté
Tic tic et tac, ça semble écrit sur le papier

Ma tristesse infectera ma mâchoire 
Plus je convoite et moins je suis belle à voir
C’est comme un merle, la fille que tu crois retenir
Tape, tape, t’appuies au hasard pour la faire jouir et 

Que faire
De l’énergie que j’perds
Quand j’te veux
Damn dis-moi comment mieux 
(Toucher)

Je suis allée noyer ma fame puisque c’est elle qui t’a plu
Un billet pour Stella qui sucera mes amours déçus
Dans le noyau des villes, ils m’interpellent depuis leur quechu’
« T’es t’es t’es qui ? De la monnaie, pas des vendus ! »

Revenue au matin pleine de sueur
Mon corps menti entre les bras du passeur
Accroupie, laisser toute la meute rager
T’es qui pour me traiter, toi ?

Que faire
De l’énergie que j’perds
Quand j’te veux
Damn dis-moi comment mieux 
(Toucher)

Touché, touché, touché, touché…

Ahead of the ceremony, Al Jazeera has been exploring the nuclear capabilities of countries around the world, and their impact on citizens.
 
Hiroshi Harada was six years old when the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in Japan. It was the first and only time that nuclear weapons have been used in war.
 
He tells us his story and the significance of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome), the only structure left standing when the bomb exploded.

Bolton will replace H. R. McMaster as national security advisor at the White House. Trump announced the move on Twitter, writing ""I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor."" The president added, ""I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on April 9th.""  Bolton had been previously considered to serve as Secretary of State, a position held for just over one year by Rex Tillerson.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. suggested this week that leaks from the White House are crimes. “If you’ve got the national security council team leaking to the press, that’s a big deal,” he told reporters at a Heritage Foundation-sponsored event on Wednesday. “Quite frankly, some of the other stuff they’ve leaked is actually a crime,” he added. According to the Washington Post, Trump had been pressured by aides against congratulating Russian President Vladimir Putin on the latter’s reelection. The paper claimed that Trump had been given a brief that read in capital letters: “DO NOT CONGRATULATE.” As did Barack Obama, Trump called to congratulate Putin on the Russian’s electoral victory. Meadows said that the leak came from Trump’s national security team, which was headed by McMaster.

Bolton served as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under George W. Bush but resigned because he was deemed unlikely to win confirmation from the Senate in which a newly elected Democratic Party majority took control in January 2007. A Fox News contributor, Bolton is also a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), senior advisor for Freedom Capital Investment Management, and an attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Kirkland & Ellis. 

In 2012, Bolton served as foreign policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He has been involved with politically conservative organizations, including the National Rifle Association, U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Project for the New American Century, Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf, the Council for National Policy, and the Gatestone Institute.

Early in March, Bolton appeared on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and was asked by host Tucker Carlson to identify which country presents the greatest threat to the U.S. Bolton said that Iran figures as the most dangerous threat. Carlson asserted that Iran’s power grew because of the overthrow of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein by the U.S. and allies. “I think you’ll concede that Saddam was the greatest counterbalance to Iran, and they were empowered by his fall,” Carlson said.

When Bolston replied, “I think your analysis is simple-minded, frankly,” a tense exchange ensued. Bolton said, “Life is complicated in the Middle East. When you say ‘the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a mistake,’ it’s simplistic.” As the exchange became tenser, “I would argue that I’m the one who understands how complicated it is,” Carlson said. “It’s your long experience in foreign policy,” Bolton replied to Carlson. “Better record than yours, I would say,” Carlson shot back. “But thank you, ambassador. Good to see you.” Bolton appeared dismissive, saying, “Sure.”

What is ASMR? Here’s my definition: https://youtu.be/qAEM95ixp-s

Remember!
ASMR is not a medical treatment. ASMR is meant to induce tingles, relaxation, and sleep. Although it may make you feel better, it has not been proven to fix any mental health issues or conditions you may have. If you need help, PLEASE seek a professional. Here are a few links that can help you:

Really good run, took hundreds upon hundreds of attempts to get a run with all the hard loadwarps first try and a pace like this one, with this being only the second of all the runs I did that had a good Kellogg slide. First ever sub 40 run and I'm very proud of it, it definitely was not easy. Really don't like the state this run puts any% in though because of how annoying the loadwarps are, but worth it for the 39. Even without the new strats I incorporated, it's the best speedrun of Fallout 4 to date. Maybe the most proud I've been of a world record, or run in general of mine.

Catching Up with Andre - Jumanji: https://youtu.be/xbWE-0RpoC8
Every Jumanji Reference in Film & TV - https://youtu.be/ja7WcBaRONU

Andre Black Nerd first time watching Jumanji (1995). After a strange Mandela Effect of actually never watching Jumanji, watching and reviewing the 1995 Jumanji movie for the first time to see if it holds up, just in time for the new movie, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle. Jumanji 1995 stars Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier, and Jonathan Hyde. Directed by Joe Johnston (Honey I Shrunk the Kids, The Rocketeer, The Pagemaster, Jurassic Park III, Captain America The First Avenger)

A magical board game unleashes a world of adventure on siblings Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst). While exploring an old mansion, the youngsters find a curious, jungle-themed game called Jumanji in the attic. When they start playing, they free Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), who's been stuck in the game's inner world for decades. If they win Jumanji, the kids can free Alan for good -- but that means braving giant bugs, ill-mannered monkeys and even stampeding rhinos!

This bike had a sign on it which said ""free to a good home"" so I took it with me and decided it was time for THE FREE BIKE CHALLENGE!

The bike is super old but the only problem were the flat tyres, after pumping them up the beast was ready to hit the mtb trails. The brakes are old school cantilever's but were kind of sharp, which was suprising! 

I ended up trying jumps, berms , hills and this thing survived the session, for the next video I want to do the bike up and make it stronger  with better parts then see what it is capable of!! Is that a good idea?

The trails are called danbury common and they are in essex fairly close to my hometown so its awesome to just blast down there and get involved in some action! 


ENJOY!

Lyrics:
You say you got a girl
And how you want me
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is wreckless
Of knowin' you're selfish
Knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it to last, last
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30
No later than, drop them drawers
Give me what I want

My man is my man is your man
Her, this her man too
My man is my man is your man
Her, that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them
More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

My man is my man is your man
Her, this her man too
My man is my man is your man
Her, that's her man
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MmfxG-Af8FY/hqdefault.jpg,0.009094197610321757,0.0002828424762082653,32.152870856728846,0.0002195730579656992,0.009377040086530022,0.00959661314449572,2018-01-21,06:29:20,Sunday,6,4,1,4,1,17,2,1,2,1,0,2,0,1,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.571907794749321,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

There's nothing I can do about it and the original source of the clip was a total disaster. The audio is completely off and sometimes faster, sometimes slower, but I somehow manage to extract the best of the game and adjust it to the right timeline here for you all. If I just posted the full game, people who understand bball and Mandarin would consider it a bad quality vid. I never do click bait shit to my viewers!

Shanghai is definitely my team! I love the atmosphere and the fans, also that DJ is a WHITE English man! He speaks fluent Chinese and Shanghai dialiect! This just shows how special Shanghai is! Look at that MacBook Pro man! LMAO!

This game was actually kind of rigged! That three pointer late in OT shouldn't even have been counted! It was a two-pointer at best! Not to mention that Jimmer traveled so bad before releasing the shot. Here in CBA they never called that stupid pivot foot travel LOL! Growing up that hop-off-the-same-feet move has always been a sick move we used to go by defenders, but man it's illegal now! What seems funny to me was the opposing team didn't even do nothing about the shot. They didn't even realize it! This shot could've changed the game, and Shanghai would've lost. This just shows how crazy the home-court advantage here in CBA is!

I subtracted that three from Jimmer's triple double stats in hope of doing even a little justice to the opposing team. He still made ten threes though.. Even his miraculous hop three-point floater should've been counted a travel in the nba.....

And last but not least, Marbury can still play I gotta give him some credit! That one block was on Jimmer, and what induced the kisses twice!!! Jimmer's wife Whitney is very white and blonde, white and blonde like a barbie!

1) ‘Star Wars’: New Film Series to Be Written by ‘Game of Thrones’ Creators Benioff and Weiss

2) Joaquin Phoenix in Talks to Play The Joker in Standalone DC Movie

3) Box Office Report  

4) Michael Bay Eyed to Direct ‘Lobo’ Movie for DC

5) David Leitch Frontrunner to Direct Dwayne Johnson/Jason Statham ‘Fast and Furious’ Spinoff

6) Venom teaser released along with new Deadpool 2 trailer

7) Live Twitter Questions

Lucasfilm and Disney announced a new series of films set in the  Star Wars Universe is in development with David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creative team behind HBO’s Game of Thrones. In the statement released by Lucasfilm, the new films will be separate from both the episodic Skywalker saga and the recently-announced trilogy being developed by Rian Johnson, writer-director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. 

According to Variety, three-time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix is in talks to play The Joker in a standalone DC movie for Warner Bros, set around the origins of the Clown Prince of Crime; and co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, the filmmaker behind War Dogs and The Hangover trilogy. 

BOX OFFICE REPORT 

AGREE / DISAGREE 

According to TheWrap, Michael Bay is being eyed to helm a Lobo movie for Warner Bros, based on the DC Comics character, and said to be Warner’s answer to Marvel’s Deadpool. The Transformers filmmaker reportedly met with DC Films execs to discuss the project and offered notes to screenwriter Jason Fuchs (Pan, Wonder Woman) who will incorporate them into a rewrite. 

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Deadpool 2 helmer David Leitch is in early talks with Universal to join the Fast-family as director of the untitled Fast and Furious spinoff starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. 

A new trailer and teaser dropped while Collider was on the move, the first being a new look at Deadpool 2, this time featuring more on Wade Wilson’s time-traveling buddy Cable (played by Josh Brolin).  The following day, another Marvel property (outside the MCU) was teased, this time with Venom, starring Tom Hardy.

ABOUT FAR CRY 5:

Welcome to Hope County, Montana. When your arrival incites the cult to violently seize control of the region, you must rise up and spark the fires of resistance to liberate a besieged community.

Freely explore Hope County’s rivers, lands, and skies with the largest customizable weapon and vehicle roster ever in a Far Cry game. You are the hero of the story in a thrilling world that hits back with every punch, and where the places you discover and the locals you ally with will shape your story in ways you’ll never see coming.

 Key Features:

SPARK THE FIRES OF RESISTANCE AGAINST A FANATIC CULT:

 CARVE YOUR OWN PATH:

From the moment you enter Hope County you have the freedom to tackle the world in any order you choose.

A WORLD THAT EVOLVES
Play your way against Joseph Seed and his fanatical followers in a dynamic open world that adapts and reacts to the choices you make.

DYNAMIC TOYS
Tear up the countryside in iconic American vehicles you can make your own; from muscle cars to big rigs, from ATVs to tractors.

Lyrics:

Want you close to me 
More than 6 degrees 
Support the weight of me 
Can't live without that  

We met at 17 
You were such a drama queen 
White sands and tangerines 
Can't live without that 

But you offer me cold hands
Cause I'm not your man 
And you've always been here 
Watching me make plans 
With these one night stands 
And you've always been clear 


You feel it
concede it 
Can't live it like that 
You feel it
conceded
can't live it like that (can't live it like that)

We are black as velveteen 
Focused on our energy 
Like the sound of tambourines 
We can't live without that 

Now your drifting other scenes 
I been on my Steve McQueen 
Driving, crashing everything 
I can't live it like that 

But you offer me cold hands
Cause I'm not your man 
And you've always been here 
Watching me making plans 
With these one night stands 
And you've always been clear 


You feel it
concede it 
Can't live it like that 
You feel it
conceded
can't live it like that (can't live it like that)


I Want you close to me 
More than 6 degrees 
Support the weight of me 
Can't live without that  

We met at 17 
You were such a drama queen 
White sands and tangerines 
I can't live without that (can't leave it like that)

when you're wrong you feel it
concede it 
can't live it like that 
you're wrong you feel it
conceded
can't live it like that (can't live it like that)
when you're wrong you feel it
concede it 
can't live it like that 
you're wrong you feel it
conceded
can't live it like that (can't live it like that)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MqWSMXAMqmI/sddefault.jpg,0.009737832759793391,0.0002424356703683002,40.16666666666666,0.0004242624231445253,0.009980268430161691,0.010404530853306216,2018-04-13,04:34:40,Friday,4,9,56,9,44,51,338,4,66,1,0,6,10,2,9,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4953139537240325,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

I'm finally driving my supercharged S2000! Which leads to four questions: 1) How is it to drive? 2) How fast is it - real world, not dyno results? 3) Is it worth the cost to supercharge an S2000? 4. Why did I choose to supercharge my S2000 rather than other options?

From a driving aspect, what I like about the modified S2000 is that it maintains a lot of the stock refinement; it doesn't feel significantly modified car from a drive-ability standpoint, it's just as street-able as it always has been (or hasn't been). It's just faster! 

To test how much faster, I used the same method I've been using since I bought the S2000. I use a VBOX sport and accelerate on the same road in the same direction, in the same gear from 10 mph to 60 mph, and measure the improvement in acceleration in increments of 5 mph. The video includes full details of test results!

10 - Not one, but two! 
Scott Lake in Florida were hit with not one, but two sinkholes in quick succession of each other. The largest one was 200-feet wide and 15-feet deep. The holes destroyed the lake, which almost lost all of it’s water, leaving many fish, alligators and turtles to perish on the dry beds. This took place in June 2006. 


9 - Lesson Learnt
I’m sure the Hertfordshire County Council won’t make this mistake again. What started off as a small hole, ended up as this monstrosity! Residents had reported the small hole to the council on a Monday, and the council had plans to have the hole filled in on the Thursday – but that was already too late. Residents heard this massive crash, and the entire road just caved in. The hole was 66-feet wide and 33-feet deep! Thankfully no one was hurt, although they did evacuate some people from a local sports arena just in case.


8 - Underneath it all
This is the Mount Gambier Sinkhole located in South Australia. This one was formed by the acidic groundwater which over time eroded the porous limestone in the area. That region is home to many water-filled caves, but this particular one has become a tourist attraction, and now boasts exquisite gardens for tourists and locals to enjoy.


7 - Lost my appetite 
It was November of 2015, when just outside the House of Pancakes in Meridian, MS, a giant sinkhole opened up and swallowed up 15 cars in the process. The hole was 15-feet wide and the sound the ground made when it happened made diners believe it was earthquake taking place! Nobody was injured when the event occurred. 


6 - Water in the well
The Montezuma Well is found in the Montezuma National Monument Park in Arizona. The exact date of when this sink hole was formed is not certain, but it’s believed it’s been there since pre-historic times! It’s 365-feet wide and 55-feet deep. Around 1.4 million gallons of water course through the hole daily, and because the water has such high levels of Co2 and so little oxygen, the water supports absolutely no fish. 


5 - Going, going gone
This wasn’t a very welcome surprise for a farmer in China. When he woke up he found that a huge sinkhole had formed in his lake, which had swallowed up thousands of his fish! He believes it has something to do with a nearby quarry that was draining a huge amount of groundwater in the area. 


4 - More than a mouthful
You can try pronounce the traditional name of Boesmansgat, or you can just call it Bushman’s Hole.  This is thought to be the 3rd deepest freshwater sinkhole in the world, and its located in South Africa. This sinkhole was discovered by Mike Rathbourne in 1977, and it’s the same spot where Verna van Schaik made it into the Guinness World Records for the deepest dive for a female in 2004. 

3 - Down the drain 
This mysterious hole is located in Lake Berryessa in California, and isn’t a natural occurrence like some of our previous entries, but is actually a really huge drain called a spillway. The drain ensures that no flooding takes place, and it sucks away the excess water. You only see it working like this when there have been heavy rains, which is always great for the locals – who come out in droves to watch this giant drain in action.


2 - A little unexpected
This sinkhole was caused by the rupturing of a large sewer line when rain came pelting down on it. It took place in San Antonio in Texas, and two cars were engulfed into the hole, with one of the occupants unfortunately not pulling through. While firefighters were working on the scene, it gave way further, exposing them to raw sewage. 


1 – Fast Grower
Over in Daisette in Texas, a pretty small sinkhole of 20-feet formed. Residents weren’t too worried; however, the hole grew so quickly devouring everything in its path. Within 24-hours this hole had spread to 900-feet wide and 260-feet deep. This little oil town sits on the Hull Salt Done, which is ultimately a 4-mile geologic formation of pure compact salt. It’s believed the saltwater waste has been stored underground for years, and it just eventually gave way to form this massive pit.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MtSKneS7B3g/hqdefault.jpg,0.006355343710765197,0.0007555303712098486,8.411764705882353,0.0006222014821728165,0.007110874081975045,0.007733075564147863,2017-12-22,21:00:01,Friday,4,5,66,5,48,33,521,1,84,2,3,3,1,2,15,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.614921887223036,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Ford GT combined fuel efficiency: 14.9 l/100 km
Ford GT combined CO2 emissions: 350 g/km
 
The declared Fuel/Energy Consumptions, CO2 emissions and electric range are measured according to the technical requirements and specifications of the European Regulations (EC) 715/2007 and (EC) 692/2008 as last amended. Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are specified for a vehicle variant and not for a single car. The applied standard test procedure enables comparison between different vehicle types and different manufacturers. In addition to the fuel efficiency of a car, driving behaviour as well as other non-technical factors play a role in determining a car's fuel/energy consumption, CO2 emissions and electric range. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
 
From 1 September 2017, certain new vehicles will be type-approved using the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) according (EU) 2017/1151 as last amended, which is a new, more realistic test procedure for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. From 1 September 2018 the WLTP will fully replace the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), which is the current test procedure. During NEDC Phase-out, WLTP fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are being correlated back to NEDC. There will be some variance to the previous fuel economy and emissions as some elements of the tests have altered i.e., the same car might have different fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

Ever since Pokémon GO launched, we've loved hearing stories of Trainers venturing abroad and playing together with new friends from different countries. That's what inspired us to create Pokémon GO Travel, a new way to see the world through the eyes of a Pokémon Trainer. To kick things off, Pokémon GO Travel is taking a diverse group of Trainers from around the world to Japan to host our first-ever Global Catch Challenge.
 
Join us as we discover new places, meet new people, and work together in an attempt to catch 3 billion Pokémon in just 7 days. Play along with IHasCupquake, Coisa de Nerd, and Rachel Quirico as they travel to learn more about Japanese culture, inspire the world to play together, and update you on the amazing rewards the community unlocks along the way—including Farfetch’d appearing worldwide for a limited time!

I got my Roof Rack from the Toyota Dealership near me, but this one seems to be the same on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2rIljxm  The one I got from the dealership was not perfect, and I had to push pretty hard on the passenger side to get the bolt holes to line up. But it all fell into place eventually.

If you are thinking about saving a few bucks and installing the roof rack on your toyota Tacoma, this might just be the video for you.  See if you want to attempt the same roof rack installation on your own. This project took me about 45 minutes, because the passenger side wouldnt line up perfectly... but I eventually got the holes to line up with a little bit of force.

She may be in her early 20’s, but Camila Cabello already has an impressive roster of exes. In this video, we are breaking down the confirmed relationships as well as her rumored flings. These are 7 guys Camila Cabello has dated. Back in 2015, the singer confirmed that Austin Mahone was her first love and even her first kiss, but you might be surprised what he had to say about their relationship. Then, there was that one time Camila was spotted at the same LA nightclub as Louis Tomlinson, but does that mean they dated? You’ll have to watch the video to see. We are also revealing who Camila’s latest beau is, and believe us; you aren’t alone if you didn’t see this relationship coming.

In this video:

On the morning of April 5, 1943, about ten miles off the coast of Brazil, a fishing family in their small boat spotted a Chinese man on a much smaller wooden raft bobbing up and down in the Atlantic Ocean.

On Friday, he will be the first North Korean leader since 1953 to cross over into South Korea’s side of the demilitarized zone that divides the two countries. And he could make even more history if he and South Korean President moon Jae-in agree to officially end a war that began in 1950 and technically never ended. 

The summit between the two leaders will focus on establishing a path to denuclearization, which means finding a way to convince Kim to get rid of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. After decades of war games, missile tests, bombings, assassinations, and threats, it will likely take baby steps to get there. But if Kim agrees to formally end the Korean War, it would be a leap in the right direction. 

Read: How Kim Jong Un could hide North Korea’s nukes from Trump

Much of the Korean Peninsula’s current political predicament can be traced back to how nation split apart. It wasn’t until after World War II, when the United States and Soviet Union split the country along the 38th parallel that one Korea became two.   

“The division of Korea was really unprecedented and unexpected,” said Charles King Armstrong, a historian at Columbia University. “Korea had been a unified nation for well over a thousand years before 1945.”

It only took five years for a civil war to erupt and spiral into a proxy conflict over the spread of communism. The bloody fighting devastated both North and South Korea and claimed millions of lives until Kim Jong-un’s grandfather agreed to a truce in 1953, signing the armistice at the same village where Friday’s meeting will be held. 

While that agreement halted the fighting, it didn’t officially end the war. VICE News spoke with Armstrong about why the Korean War isn’t actually over and the significance of the meeting between Kim and Moon.

Dec. 11, 2017 | Sidney Madden -- Tyler, The Creator's Tiny Desk performance was a first for many reasons. It was the Los Angeles rapper's first time performing at our offices, but moreover, it was the Tiny Desk's first nighttime performance, a special request from Tyler and his team in order to professionally light the ""stage"" themselves. Members of Tyler's lighting crew came to the office a day before to set it up, eventually bathing him and his band in shades of fuchsia, orange and blue — one for each song — during the early evening show.

Flower Boy, Tyler's latest album, is much like this Tiny Desk performance; a surprising departure from the expected. Four albums in, he has matured as a producer, rapper and human being. Often equated to hip-hop's class clown, the 26-year-old peels back his own mask of immaturity to reveal a young adult grappling with anxiety, fear and uncertainty of self.

After he was done, Tyler did something of a modified mic-drop, throwing his tambourine in celebration of what he and his band had accomplished. Always one to stay casually connected with his fans, Tyler made time — nearly an hour after the performance was done —- to pose for photos, sign merch and crack jokes with (and on) everyone around him.

Set List
""Boredom""
""See You Again""
""Glitter""

MUSICIANS
Tyler Okonma (vocals, keys), Jaret Landon (MD/Keys) Dré Pinckney (Bass), Dalton Hodo (Drums), Kaye Fox (background vocals), Kiandra Richardson (background vocals)

A lot of people only portray their best selves on social media and today I decided to show all sides of myself online totally. I talked about my honest insecurity and sadness and how I was planning on handling these emotions. I discuss mental health and anxiety from a realistic perspective. ENJOY!

In this vibrant school-set re-working of Cyrano, an awkward but imaginative pupil (Alex Lawther) helps the handsome but spectacularly dim school-hero (Jonah Hauer-King) pursue the fiery daughter (Pauline Étienne) of a visiting French teacher (Denis Ménochet).

In the second half of this vlog I really opened up about what has been going on in my mind lately... I am trying my very best to reinvent myself into the person I want to be and leave every bad thought behind. The first step to me was opening up completely to you guys instead of just continuing on like I used to. Thank you guys so much for sticking with me through this, I can't explain what it means to me. #tannclann

theHunter Call of the Wild made huge impression on me in terms of graphics. This game looks absolutey AMAZING! And if you haven't had a chance to play it, you may now cath up with it as it was recentlyy added to Xbox Game Pass library.
As I'm not a big fan of hunting I sure find this game enjoyable just by walking down the forrest, listening the sounds and observing teh wildlife.
It also reminded me Montana shown in Far Cry 5. So let's have a look how both games presents the wild life.
Which one do you prefer?

In case you're wondering - Far Cr 5 was captured on PS4 Pro and theHunter Call of the Wild on Xbox One X - both at 1080p display.

Crew and Macy’s that are shrinking their brick-and-mortar operations.

But one retailer — Dollar General — is doing just the opposite.

The discount store has opened more stores than ever before, with more than 5,000 new locations across the U.S. since 2010. It now has more than 14 thousand stores in the country — or just about as many as McDonald’s.

It's opening up stores in parts of the country that were slow to rebound from the recession —low income, rural communities that larger retailers won't touch — and they're making a lot of money doing it.

VICE News traveled to Kansas, where the rise of the discount store has spurred the fall of another, arguably more crucial type of establishment: small, local grocery stores.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

""Two teens at a Maryland high school were shot Tuesday after another student opened fire in the hallway just before the start of classes, authorities said.

The shooter — identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17 — was injured and taken to the hospital, where he died, St. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron said at a news conference.

Great Mills High School remained on lockdown for some time after, but the shooting was ""contained"" when a school resource officer ""engaged"" the gunman, Cameron said.

The chaos unfolded at 7:55 a.m. ET when police say Rollins walked into the 1,600-student school and fired a round from a Glock semiautomatic handgun at a 16-year-old female student, also hitting a 14-year-old male.

The school resource officer — St. Mary's County sheriff's Deputy Blaine Gaskill — was alerted to the gunfire and confronted the gunman in less than a minute, according to Cameron.

Gaskill ""fired at the shooter almost simultaneously as the shooter fired,"" Cameron said, without detailing how the gunman was injured. The officer was not wounded.

""This is your worst nightmare,"" Cameron added.”*

At the Pyeongchang Winter Games, Nagasu achieved his triumphant redemption, turning the history of figure skating in the United States into the first American woman to achieve a triple axel in the Olympic Games. It's historic and something that no one can take away from me, Nagasu said. I wanted to make the United States proud. Nagasu, 24, landed the jump in the Gangneung Ice Arena under enormous pressure, the first of five women to perform their free skating on the last day of competition to the Olympic team medal. With the United States team sitting in third place, without hope of losing the gold medal but under the threat of losing his provisional bronze in Italy, Nagasu took the ice and did not retain anything in the 4 1/2 minute show that she I had scripted Miss's music. Saigon

The triple axel was first, and she delivered, completing all the complicated rotations and landing solidly on one foot. His coach pumped his fists and jumped with excitement. From there, it was as if an anvil was lifted from the trenches of Nagasu, and she did not miss a jump or make a mistake in the skate. While her program was reduced, she was radiant, completing her final triple cycle and ending with a layback twist of sheer beauty and liberation. Nagasu shook her fists twice when her teammates cheered her, aware of her sacrifice and courage. The judges qualified her with 137.53, more than seven points more than the best mark of her season. The high risk triple axel, which actually requires 3 1/2 rotations in the air because the skaters take off from a forward position and land backwards, was the first jump in their program.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NAXmM9yleXE/sddefault.jpg,0.0008108506560518947,0.0019165560961226602,0.4230769230769231,0.00022114108801415302,0.002727406752174554,0.002948547840188707,2018-02-12,04:42:51,Monday,0,16,70,15,62,95,598,0,142,0,0,4,0,4,1,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.090971665352361,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

My full game complete walkthrough includes all bosses and boss fights, all cutscenes game movie cinematics, all levels and chapters, secrets and easter eggs, weapons and powers, all dialogues, main story line and ending of the game for PC.

Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings.

Cuphead is indie video game developed and published by StudioMDHR Entertainment. As the titular character Cuphead, the player fights a series of bosses in order to repay a debt to the devil. The game was heavily inspired by the works of 1930s cartoonists such as Max Fleischer's Fleischer Studios, and sought to keep the works' subversive and surrealist qualities.
Cuphead is released on Microsoft Windows and Xbox One on September 29, 2017.

Following is a transcript of the video:

Scott Keyes: One of the weird things about frequent flyer miles nowadays is that the vast majority of miles are not earned through actually flying. Most miles are given out through credit cards.

My name is Scott Keyes. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Scott's Cheap Flights.

Really at the end of the day all that matters is the sign up bonus. I've gotten hundreds of thousands, millions of miles just via the sign up bonus alone. In order to get the sign up bonus the credit card will say you have to spend x amount of dollars in x amount of time. So let’s say it’s typically something like $3,000 in three months. I’ll put all my spending on that credit card for the first two and a half months and then I'll set myself a calendar reminder two and a half months after I've opened up that card and I'll check my statement at that point.

How much have I spent on there? Let's say I've only spent $2,000. I'm not going to go out just to blow a thousand dollars in the next two weeks just hit the spending threshold. What I can do is actually just send my wife $1,000 over PayPal. You pay a 3% fee to do that so you're going to pay 30 bucks.

That puts $1,000 in spending on your credit card and all of a sudden you’re at the $3,000 threshold. You get those 50,000 miles for $30 extra than you would have spent.

Typically though you really want to focus on making sure you're putting all your spending on that new card to hit that spending threshold. Credit card companies are necessarily going to like hearing this but once I hit that spending threshold that credit card is going in the drawer and I'm just going to go on to the next one.

And then I'll set myself a calendar reminder so that 11 months after I've opened up that card, pull up my calendar in the morning, gives me a note. Oh snap, you need to call Citibank and be like, “Hey, you know I’ve really enjoyed using this card but the annual fee is just a little bit too rich for my blood. Can you waive it for the next year?”

Sometimes they’ll say yes. Sometimes they’ll say no. If they say no, that’s unfortunate, can we downgrade to a no-fee card? And doing that helps preserve your credit score a little bit because it maintains the credit line that you have open there. And you've saved yourself the hundred bucks or whatever the annual fee might have been.

I hate paying annual fees. Why should I pay for credit cards? There’s so many out there, so many good ones. It’s not something I like to do and try to avoid it whenever possible.

Kylie Jenner, 20, can induce hype like no other. From her hugely successful Kylie Cosmetics brand to her reported pregnancy, people will stop everything to try to keep up with her — but apparently all of the attention surrounding the upcoming birth of her first child has even surpassed her own expectations. “Kylie is pretty blown away by quite how much people seem utterly obsessed with her pregnancy, it’s like no other 20-year-old has ever given birth before,” a source close to the Kardashian family told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

Far Cry 5 is an action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Toronto and published by parent company Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the eleventh installment and the fifth main title in the Far Cry series. It was released on March 27, 2018.

Similar to its predecessors, Far Cry 5 is an action-adventure first-person shooter set in an open world environment which the player can explore freely on foot or via various vehicles. Unlike previous titles in the series where the player takes on the role of a set character, the game will feature a new character creator, which the player can use to customize their character's appearance.

The player will have a variety of ranged and explosive weapons to fight against enemies, while the game will place a renewed emphasis on close-quarters combat compared to previous Far Cry titles by introducing a wider range of melee weapons.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NDtD6a_J6Xg/sddefault.jpg,0.02935696244461927,0.0012266572812719974,23.9324894514768,0.006252329096103682,0.03058361972589127,0.03683594882199495,2018-03-27,15:13:52,Tuesday,1,12,75,12,44,63,500,3,79,1,0,10,0,1,2,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4621659753952825,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'truck': 1, 'person': 4}",5

A few months ago we asked you to help us bring Bua Banh, an injured male, to the center. Because of all of your support, we were able to keep him and start a reproduction program with two of our females.

After awhile, he started to develop an abscess on his good hind leg. An elephant abscess can be very firm, and sometimes they rupture on their own, but because of the location this wasn’t the case. We had to open it ourselves in order to drain it. The veterinarian has undertaken several interventions (haematology, histopathology, cleaning and draining of the abscess and medications) and he is still undergoing daily treatment at the hospital. His blood values have improved, and shows normal behavior again. We are still working on the source of the infection.

You can see the current daily treatment of Bua Banh and the explanations provided by the hospital team, by looking at this movie.

After all the Dorian mode is not as important as the Major or Minor key.

In this video I am going to take a practical look at the chord progressions you will encounter and what scales over what chords you are going to need. I am also going to discuss how you apply the scales to the chords and practice in a more general way towards being able to use a scale over any of it's diatonic chords.

About Teen Titans GO!: 
TEEN TITANS GO! is a comedy featuring the beloved DC heroes seen in a skewed light. They still fight crime and face classic villains, but mainly deal with all the issues of five teens rooming together -- chores, romantic tension, demon dad drop-ins and impromptu meatball parties.  They also dance! The emphasis is on the odd everyday life of super heroes who haven't grown up.

As I was editing a clip from Daenerys Targaryen's vision at the House of the Undying I noticed something that sounded very familiar. When Daenerys is looking around the Throne Room there is a new theme playing during this scene but if you listen closely the White Walkers Theme from Season 1 is also playing. I have used the White Walkers Theme in several of my videos before so I knew exactly what I was hearing when the drum/bell began to play. This leads me to believe they were foreshadowing the Night King coming to King's Landing and destroying The Great Hall. Now that the Night King has Viserion he is definitely capable of causing that damage scene during Daenerys Targaryen's vision.. Spoilers also came out this week that show a new structure being built for King's Landing and according to those sources those buildings will be burnt to the ground by a dragon. This certainly doesn't confirm anything but I feel there is enough evidence to make a case. Let me know what you think though. Make sure you listen very carefully to the music or else you will not hear it. Thanks for watching!

The Unwilling Soldier of Three Armies
https://youtu.be/zhl-nIK1kV4?list=PLR0XuDegDqP33-NUx7wuKb-3PDj-gRKgR

In this video:

On the morning of July 7, 1944, Captain Ben L. Salomon of the U.S. Army’s 105th Infantry, commissioned as a dentist, single-handedly held off a fierce attack of an overwhelming force of Japanese soldiers in order to allow sufficient time for approximately 30 of his comrades to safely retreat. After 15 hours of terrible fighting, when relief finally arrived, Salomon was found dead upon a machine gun, riddled with bullet and bayonet holes and surrounded by 98 dead enemy soldiers; and yet despite his selfless heroism, it still took 57 years for Salomon to receive the Medal of Honor – due to a misread of the rules of war.

* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *

Mike Maxwell recently finished a ninth season studying the love life of the praying mantises that live around Bishop, a town in California’s Eastern Sierra.

Over that time, he’s seen some unsettlingly strange behaviors.

It’s pretty common knowledge that female mantises sometimes eat males during or after mating — a habit that biologists call “sexual cannibalism.” 

But among the bordered mantises that Maxwell researches, it gets weirder than that.

As it turns out, when a male mantis loses his head, it doesn’t mean he loses the urge to procreate.

You read that right. Not only can some male bordered mantises continue mating even while being attacked by their female counterparts, some males are able to mount a female and initiate mating even after getting their heads completely bitten off.

“It’s a really weird, strange behavior,” said Maxwell, “So what’s going on? Why do they do it?”

-- What do praying mantises eat?

Praying mantises are mostly ambush predators that typically eat small animals like grasshoppers, crickets, bees, crickets and butterflies . They use camouflage to hide themselves and wait for their prey to come within striking distance. Then they use their raptorial forelimbs to grab their prey. Spikes on their forelimbs help them hold their prey while they eat.

-- Why do praying mantises eat each other?

Female praying mantises sometimes eat males that approach them to mate. They are only able to do this because mantises are predators and the female mantises are bigger and stronger than the males.

-- Do praying mantises bite?

Most mantises will not bite people but they will pinch people with their forelimbs to defend themselves. It feels a lot like getting bit, trust me.

Following is the transcript of the video:

Matthew Walker: My name is Matthew Walker. I am a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley and I am the author of the book, ""Why We Sleep.""

Should we actually be taking naps during the day? Well, we certainly know from evidence in my own sleep center and that of many other scientists that naps can give you benefits for both your brain and your body. But naps can actually be a double-edged sword because whilst we're awake during the day, we're building up sleepiness or sleep pressure. So that when you try to fall asleep at night, you'll fall asleep quickly and then you'll stay asleep. And when we sleep, we actually release that sleepiness, almost like a valve on a pressure cooker, so that we wake up the next morning feeling refreshed.

So if you take a nap during the day, especially if you take it too late in the afternoon, you will actually release some of that sleepiness and it will make it that much more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep soundly throughout the night. So the advice would be if you don't struggle with your sleep and you can nap regularly, then naps are just fine.

But if you do find it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep at night, then you should avoid naps and try and build up that healthy sleepiness in the evening.

The ideal nap depends on what you want from that nap. Different stages of sleep actually give you different types of brain and body benefits.

But if you want to avoid that grogginess that you can often have after a long sleep, then you should perhaps avoid naps that are longer than maybe 40 or 50 minutes in length.

You should also try to avoid naps late in the afternoon so that you wake up at least after you finish the nap and still have enough time to build up that sleepiness, that sleep pressure so you can get to sleep in the evening.

Can naps help with sleep debt?

Walker: And the answer, unfortunately, is no. Sleep is actually not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at some later point in time. So sleep is an all-or-nothing event in that sense. So you can't short sleep during the week and then try to binge and oversleep at the weekend.

So if I were to take a human being and deprive them of sleep for one night, so that they've lost eight hours of sleep and then I give them all of the recovery sleep that they want on a second, a third, even a fourth night, they do sleep longer but they never get back that full eight hours that they've lost.

And we can ask then, ""Why isn't there some kind of a credit system in the brain? Why don't we have a cell that can actually store up that sleep?""

Because there is precedent for this. We actually have a storage system for calories within in the body and they're called, ""fat cells."" Because there was a time during the evolutionary process where we had feast and where we had famine. And when we had feast, we would store that caloric energy and fat cells that when we went into a debt during that caloric famine, we could actually survive.

Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason. And that means that Mother Nature has never had to face the challenge of sleep deprivation during the course of evolution and therefore, she's never had to come up with a safety net mechanism that overcomes a sleep debt.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NJY_bgv5j8c/sddefault.jpg,0.024529855868222376,0.0007000686341798216,35.03921568627451,0.001331503088538092,0.0252299245024022,0.02656142759094029,2018-01-02,15:45:46,Tuesday,1,10,28,10,28,45,260,0,64,0,1,10,12,4,2,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.666297169349452,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'bed': 1, 'person': 1}",2

The first hymn, Lord of All Hopefulness; Prince Harry lifts Meghan's veil. 

Hundreds of guests watched the couple exchange vows in a #ceremony featuring a gospel choir and an American preacher. 

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been declared husband and wife, following a service at Windsor Castle. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. Wearing a dress by British designer Clare Waight Keller, Ms Markle was met by Prince Charles, who walked her down the aisle.
Following their marriage, the couple will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

Today's video is a what I eat in a day video + a butt workout at gym. This video is also super helpful to show how I get back on track after an indulgent period / binging. This is a typical full day of eating for me, but this is a very ""healthy"" kinda day. I enjoy a balanced lifestyle, where some days I'll eat super clean and others I'll be on the couch with a pizza in one hand and a wine in the other. It's all about listening to your body, and I hope this video helps give an insight of my diet :) 
I no longer track my macros or calories as that really messed me up mentally. I just eat when I'm hungry and fuel my body with what it needs!

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

Lyrics:
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You

Jesus, the name above every other name
Jesus, the only one who could ever save
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You

Holy, there is no one like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder
Show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me

Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You

Jesus, the name above every other name
Jesus, the only one who could ever save
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You

Holy, there is no one like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder
Show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me

I will build my life upon Your love
It is a firm foundation
I will put my trust in You alone
And I will not be shaken

Holy, there is no one like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder
Show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLhdzuCSmIw/sddefault.jpg,0.011345887636842916,0.00022398748079870639,50.65411511565358,0.00030363015148614307,0.011569875117641622,0.011873505269127766,2018-05-03,21:16:37,Thursday,3,8,25,8,22,37,219,2,49,0,0,6,2,1,1,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.183996730166196,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

It seems like thanks to their wealth and status the Kardashian family can have anything that they want. But there is a ton of stuff that they don’t, and we’ll let you know what items have been banned from the houses of the Kardashian family. Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner may be young, but they’ve already developed a hatred for two insanely popular chocolate dessert items. Kourtney seems the most strict of all the siblings, having banned everything from microwaves to soda from her house. Khloe Kardashian is all about diet and fitness, but we’ll tell you what trend she won’t be allowing in her home. Kim Kardashian went through a harrowing experience during one fateful fashion week, and since then she’s banned her own jewelry from her house. Have you banned any of these things from your life? Let us know in the comment section, and then hit the subscribe button for more from TheTalko.

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

""There was once a king with 12 daughters, and a mystery. Every night he locked their bedroom door, and every morning he awoke to find that their shoes had been danced to pieces. ‘Where do you go every night?’ he wondered. ‘Can an evening really hold so much?’

I sip the drink, I lie to you, I go to secret worlds.

I wreck my sneakers, climb the walls. Sweat. Laugh. Hyperventilate.
And after a hundred fluorescent nights, my heart begins to rebuild.

Listen to the fairy tales. Dance until you cannot see. I promise it will change you.

‘Cause when the sky gets dark, that’s when we’re reborn""

This video is from Lorde's Night 2 Christchurch New Zealand show at the Isaac Theatre Royal, Thur 9th of November 2017 [filmed by Lorde_fix].

The first part of Lorde's dialogue here references the Brothers Grimm fairytale 'The Twelve Dancing Princesses'.

On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday, March 27th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Ti, Kristian Harloff, and Mark Reilly discuss the following:

- 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix' and 'The New Mutants' move to 2019

- ‘Captain Marvel’ Filming Begins; Clark Gregg and Lee Pace Join Cast

- First Look at Tom Hardy as Al Capone in Josh Trank’s ‘Fonzo’

- ‘Ready Player One’ Scribe Zak Penn Lands ‘ROM’ Writing Gig for Hasbro/Paramount

- Gina Rodriguez To Star As Carmen Sandiego In Netflix Live-Action Feature

- Steven Spielberg Says ‘Tintin 2’ Is Still Happening

- Live Twitter Questions

Marvel Studios has announced the start of production on the upcoming Captain Marvel yesterday and in doing so revealed some old favorite characters will be returning for the 90’s set prequel. While the press release announced the below-the-line talent and synopsis, the big reveal was that Clark Gregg’s Agent Coulson will be making his return to the big screen along with Guardians of the Galaxy actors Djimon Hounsou and Lee Pace, reprising their roles as Ronan and Korath.

Production is underway on Chronicle and Fantastic Four director Josh Trank’s dramatic take on the life of gangster Al Capone, and star Tom Hardy has revealed a first look at himself as the notorious figure.

Deadline reports that Hasbro is moving full-steam ahead with their live-action cinematic universe for Allspark Pictures, setting Ready Player One scribe Zak Penn to adapt Rom the Spaceknight.  No details are available Penn’s take on the material, but it will take elements from the mythology of the late 70’s/early 80’s toy – that was also spun off into a Marvel Comic Book line.

Deadline reports that Netflix has acquired the live-action feature film rights to Carmen Sandiego and has attached Gina Rodriguez to star as the title character. The movie will be a standalone Carmen adventure that will embrace the popular ’90s property however, no writer or director has been attached for the film.

Tintin 2 is not dead yet. This according to Steven Spielberg, who made his animated feature film debut directing the 2011 motion-capture film The Adventures of Tintin. The film was produced by Peter Jackson, and the plan was for the two filmmakers to swap roles on the sequel.

As soon as I got there, I found so many great places to eat! I got a lot of recommendations to try certain places, so here are my thoughts!

Some highlights include the Sister Curry Mee, you can't get enough of their noodles! These sisters have been making noodles for over 70 years, and you can tell by the first sip that they put nothing but love in their broth.

The Penang Assam Laksa hawker stall is a must-have! The uncle has been making this recipe for years with his daughter, and it really is one of the most authentic laksas you can get. Just thinking about it makes me want to fly back there...

And of course I had to take a nice break by eating a massive bowl of ramen noodles! To be fair, it wasn't the freshest bowl of ramen noodles (I mean, the seafood was previously frozen :/ ) but come on, who can resist a giant bowl of ramen all for yourself?

You might know that Jimmy Fallon canceled all of last week's tapings following the death of his mother, Gloria and returned Monday night, still visibly shaken from his loss. Holding back tears, Fallon at one point recounted a childhood memory of his mom squeezing his hand three times to say ""I love you.""
Tonight producer, mike dicenzo said on twitter, that QUOTE Taylor was not scheduled to do our show today, but we wanted something special for the first show back, so we asked her on a complete whim, since she had been in town doing SNL. She said yes with zero hesitation.” Taylor told the show, she would sing New Year’s Day – and it was even more perfect and beautiful that you would expect.
Yes, you heard that right – the lyrics of the song actually describe the story Jimmy told about his mother.
And Taylor didn’t change the lyrics for this performance, that’s what the song is. The Roots’ drummer Questlove tweeted yesterday evening QUOTE I’m just realizing Taylor didn’t readjust the song’s lyrics for tonight’s performance. But the narrative literally applies to the words Jimmy spoke of his mother. Wow. You can’t plan these things @taylorswift13 @FallonTonight
That kind of serendipity sends shivers down my spine. I’m so glad Jimmy’s mother was present even in Taylor’s unscheduled musical performance.  Nobody knew ahead of time what the song would be, as the producer tweeted QUOTE; She sang ""New Year's Day."" No one had heard it. Suddenly she sings the line, ""Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi."" I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing.
Jimmy, of course, was also profoundly affected by Taylor’s song, the producer tweeted.
“I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. ""Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,""
What an incredibly profound and touching moment. As the producer said as well, Whatever you think of Taylor, she did something beautiful for Jimmy and our show and we’re forever grateful. And we, at Clevver, are grateful that Jimmy got to pay tribute to his mother in such a meaningful way.  How incredible is this? Let us know all of your thoughts in the comment section below. Thank you so much for watching Clevver, I’m Zoe Lillian and I’ll see you next time

Already a high-profile model, artist & stylist, the 23-year-old Harlem native is poised to make a huge splash in the near future. After wrapping up 3.PARADIS' Fall/Winter 2018 editorial, Bloody Osiris invited us to his home turf for the latest entry in our IRL video series.

""The energy that I bring is more than just styling,"" Bloody Osiris explains. ""It's about the energy."" Elsewhere, he elaborated on how easy it was to link up with Virgil Abloh because they ""[bounce] off"" each other artistically and creatively. ""I learn from him a lot.""

Later, Bloody Osiris notes, ""Every dude I hang around with is authentic. That doesn't mean he's tough. That just means he's true to him."" In a key moment, Bloody Osiris breaks down why he's all about positivity, ""being fly"" and helps build the confidence of others. As he concludes: ""This is just a start. Be confident. Be great.""

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Dave - My wife and I were having a debate on who is the best actor of our generation. She thinks it’s Hanks I say it’s Day Lewis. Her argument is that Day Lewis is “the best actor to be in no one's favourite movie” and will not be remembered by the masses as fondly as Hanks. That got me thinking should Day Lewis have mixed it up a little more genre wise to truly be considered the greatest?

PATREON Supporter Kevin - I went into JL tonight with very low expectations and came out having really enjoyed it. It was a blast! I doubted your faith that it would be good, but you were right. Unfortunately, the GC was very bad. My question: have the number of films requiring GC strained the industry's ability to meet demand? Have any of the studio's been able to corral the best talent? Thanks and go filthy!

Jenson Vettickanakudy - Hello John! Greetings from the Bronx. We all know how you feel about 3D glasses and how it masks the beautiful, colorful cinematography. So it had me thinking... Can the very same be said by CGI motion capture? An actor giving a strong, heartfelt, powerful performance with emotions...only to be covered in motion sensors, reflective markers, and masked in CGI.

Marco from Milan, Italy - My question is: I know that the term 'domestic' box office refers to the combined box office of the United States and Canada, but... why? Why aren't there distinct numbers and charts for these two Nations?

Garrett Green - Hey John. Big fan of the show and watch your videos everyday. The next DCEU film, Aquaman, isn’t slated to release until December 21, 2018. That’s 13 months after the release of Justice League. Do you think this huge gap will this have an impact on Aquaman?  Will this over a year long gap between movies cause a decline in interest in the DCEU?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NV4Mt_nJSyQ/hqdefault.jpg,0.030101929305171967,0.0017882334240696218,16.833333333333332,0.011762602078324623,0.03189016272924159,0.04365276480756621,2017-11-17,16:54:09,Friday,4,15,14,15,14,80,110,2,31,1,2,13,12,5,0,4.0,7.0,"['AUST aR UT tS', '', 'Le a:', 'a Hy 4', 'fe y', '', '  ', '', 'oP A', 'ee']","['AUST', 'aR', 'UT', 'tS', 'Le', 'a:', 'a', 'Hy', '4', 'fe', 'y', 'oP', 'A', 'ee']",True,"['aust', 'aR', 'UT', 'tS', 'Le', 'a', ':', 'a', 'Hy', '4', 'fe', 'y', 'oP', 'A', 'ee']",15,14,26,1,2,3,4,6.297618613248598,4,"['sad', 'sad', 'neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,2,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

Speed: When you want to get faster on your local trails, its easy to think you just need to pin every section of trail and just try to hang on. But you will actually find yourself going faster by taking your time, and entering difficult sections a bit slower.

Jumping: It's always tempting to just send it on the biggest jump you can find. But that is just a great way to hurt yourself! Instead, slowly work your way up from small tabletops to larger jumps when you feel comfortable doing so.

Cornering: Line choice is absolutely crucial in cornering. If you take your time to choose the right lines you'll soon find yourself flying around corners without going out of your comfort zone.

Linking full sections of trail: If you put together all of these tips, you'll be linking up full technical sections of trail better than you ever have!

1)    How can Disney assure these producers or content creators who might be hesitant to fit the “Disney model” for their work that they will have creative freedom?

2)    Fox recently pushed back the release date for Alita: Battle Angel from July 20 to December 21. Aquaman, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, and Bumblebee are all around this date. What is the logic in placing so many big movies in the same date?

3)    What actually is the criteria for Best Animated Feature?

4)    SPOILERS!!! When are we going to find out where the Soul Stone is?

5)    With the Oscars coming up, who do you think gave a performance that went completely under the radar?

But in comparing the two films, one cannot help but see how Black Panther is vastly superior in terms of character, message, subtext and overall, being the social inspiration we want these characters to be. 

Reel School puts it to you, Reel Students: In terms of representing a marginalized portion of our world, who's the better role model? #BlackPanther? Or #WonderWoman?

Why Did NASA End The Space Shuttle Program?
https://gizmodo.com/why-did-nasa-end-the-space-shuttle-program-1721140493 
“There is an inherent risk in space travel, and with each failure the reliability of subsequent flights improved. So it is a fair question to ask why the program did not continue.

Musk promised more information in the days to come, adding that the suit ""actually works"" and has been tested to double pressure.”

You might be a huge fan of Riverdale, but Dylan Sprouse hasn’t fully joined the fandom quite yet. 

You’d think the Sprouse twins would be each other’s biggest fans. 

While millions of people literally count down the minutes until new episodes of Riverdale air each week, and then re-watch them over and over again in the meantime, Dylan Sprouse can’t relate.

I know you may be hoping for a Suite Life reunion soon, but Dylan is pretty adamant that he wants to focus on acting in movies, not on TV, so I don’t think fans should expect him to appear on Riverdale any time soon. Are you surprised that Dylan

Kanye West made his name in music with his debut album The College Dropout hailed as a classic, he went on to dominate the music charts for over ten years. The death of his mother effected him greatly but his marriage to Kim Kardashian and the birth of his children seemed to give him much needed love and stability. Kanye however has divided fans with his support for Donald Trump and fallings out with long time friend Jay Z, people are questioning now more than ever... Where is Kanye's mind at and who is he really? this documentary from True Geordie's 'True Life Stories' series tries to answer that.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

2018's brilliant Black Panther movie has undoubtedly cemented itself as one of the best comic book movies of all time - period - and it's been rewarded with a worldwide gross of almost one-and-a-half billion dollars to date.

A hell of a lot of work and time went into making the epic and groundbreaking Marvel Studios offering - and we're going to take a look at just some of what went on behind the scenes.

These behind the scenes secrets will change how you watch Black Panther - and the secrets in question are; the 3000 prosthetic dots that were applied to Michael B. Jordan, the entirely CGI rhinos created by referencing footage of rhinos found online, Nakia's green dress in the brilliant casino scene was actually 3D-printed to suit Lupita Nyong'O's body, Kendrick Lamar chose to do the whole soundtrack after seeing the movie and being impressed by it, how Wakanda was created, how Warrior Falls was created, how the Black Panther suit was created, how some of the various combat and action scenes were shot and perfected, the rap battles that took place between certain cast members between takes, and the push-ups challenge that was born from a bet between two actors on the movie's set.

We hope you enjoy the video! Do make sure you let us know your thoughts on it by commenting in the comments section. And please don't forget to subscribe to Screen Rant's YouTube channel, so you never miss our great new video uploads in the future.

So I went to Chinatown in Kolkata India to try some dumplings, noodles and spicy chicken.

The Chinatown in India was not what I expected, mainly because there were not that many Chinese people. Also the food does taste like a very unique mix of Indian and Chinese cuisine.

We first went to Territy Bazar which is in Chinatown and it's a market that is open very very early and closes soon as the food is sold out.

(Pablo Bispo / Ruxell / Sérgio Santos / Rincon Sapiência)

LETRA:

Sagacidade pra viver
Lutar, cair, crescer
Sem arriar ou se render
Tem que defender
(Ai, ai, ai, ai)

Observar e absorver
Com fé no amor, no bem
Se liga no meu proceder
Sigo em frente e vou além

Vem dançar, brilhar
Deixar o som guiar, levar

Se liga, pega a visão do coração
Que a vida não pode parar

Entra na roda e ginga, ginga
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Entra na roda e ginga, ginga
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Se entrou na roda, vai ter que jogar
Pra se manter de pé, cê vai ter que dançar

Entra na roda e ginga, ginga
Fé na sua mandinga, na roda ginga

Se o assunto é meter dança, já larguei na pole
A cintura que destrava nesse desenrole
O corpo desenrolado não é rocambole
Seu plano já foi bolado, quero que rebole

A cintura mole, mole, mole, mole, mole
Se ela me chamar pra dança, claro que eu topo
Tamo dando gole, gole, gole, gole, gole
Uma mão tá na cintura e a outra no copo

Vem dançar, brilhar
Deixar o som guiar, levar

Se liga, pega a visão do coração
Que a vida não pode parar

Entra na roda e ginga, ginga
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Entra na roda e ginga, ginga
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Se entrou na roda, vai ter que jogar
Pra se manter de pé, cê vai ter que dançar

Not so. That’s because the only remaining undefeated team in Europe this season is up against the clock — and cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol, who Barça faces on Wednesday night at 9.00pm CET in the first leg of a Copa del Rey quarterfinal derby.

Thus, Monday’s workout served a dual purpose — to help Sunday night’s starters recover from a grueling road win that ended barely 12 hours earlier, while training the rest of the squad’s focus squarely on Espanyol and the looming battle for bragging rights in the city of Barcelona.

All available players took part on Monday, while Nélson Semedo, who was a late scratch from the trip to San Sebastián due to tonsillitis, did not.

In addition to the Copa del Rey game at Espanyol on Wednesday night, Barça faces Real Betis in Sevilla on Sunday night. The return leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinals is at Camp Nou next Thursday, January 25th, at 9.30pm CET.

""Rosie O'Donnell could be in big trouble for offering millions to GOP senators to vote against the new tax bill.

Rosie tweeted Tuesday at Republican Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake -- who both hold key votes for the legislation -- offering to pay 'em $2 mil each if they voted no.

…

The comedian immediately came under fire for what many called straight-up attempted bribery of a U.S. official, which is a crime. Rosie will likely say she's a comedian and it's just a joke ... however, she did say, ""no s**t.”

Worth noting -- the Senate passed the bill early Wednesday morning.”*

UFC 225's athletes -- including CM Punk, Tai Tuivasa, Megan Anderson, Sergio Pettis, Charles Oliveira, Colby Covington and Mike Jackson -- talk to media and stare down their opponents. Afterward, Punk offers a backstage peek at the United Center, and Anderson begins her weight cut. On Friday morning all fighters make weight except for one, leaving the event’s headliner in jeopardy.  But all parties make it to the ceremonial weigh-in, where UFC President Dana White confirms that Whittaker and Romero will indeed rematch. UFC 225 Embedded is an all-access, behind-the-scenes video blog leading up to the two world title fights on Saturday, June 9th on Pay-Per-View.

Women come and go through Woodcock’s life, providing the confirmed bachelor with inspiration and companionship, until he comes across a young, strong-willed woman, Alma (Vicky Krieps), who soon becomes a fixture in his life as his muse and lover. Once controlled and planned, he finds his carefully tailored life disrupted by love.  With his latest film, Paul Thomas Anderson paints an illuminating portrait both of an artist on a creative journey, and the women who keep his world running. Phantom Thread is Paul Thomas Anderson’s eighth movie, and his second collaboration with Daniel Day-Lewis.

Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.

If you are as much of a fan of the ""Descendants"" films as we are, then you might start to think you know everything about Auradon and the Isle of the Lost. You might think you know all about Mal, Evie, Harry Hook, Uma, and Prince Ben. But there are some things that you may not have known about that haven't been as well publicized as other things. So, today, we are going to show you 10 Dark Secrets In Descendants Disney Doesn't Want You To Know.

We'll tell you about why Dove Cameron changed her name, how one cast member let things slip, and how the cast and crew had to battle through bad weather to complete filming. Keep watching until the end to see just how Disney kept more people in the dark than you might think. Thanks for watching, and don't forget to subscribe to TheThings!

Here is what you'll need!

Last-Minute Baking Hacks
No bundt pan? Place a clean, empty soup can in the center of a round 9-inch pan. Fill the can with uncooked rice or beans to weight it down.
No cookie cutter? Cut out the midsection of a soda can and bend it to your desired shape.
No muffin tin? On a baking sheet, use the rings from mason jar lids to hold cupcake liners in place.
Wrong size pan? Resize baking pan and sheets using foil. Measure the desired size and fold up the foil to create a partition.
No powdered sugar? Just blend normal white sugar!
No cupcake liners? Cut a square of parchment paper and place it over one hole of the cupcake pan. Use a glass or measuring cup to push down the paper. Use the bottom of the glass to help refine the shape of the new makeshift liner.
No piping tools? Use a sandwich bag! Add a piece of tape to one of the bottom corners to reinforce the tip then snip off for your desired shape!
Cut off a thin slit from one side to create a ruffled design.
Cut straight across the tip, then fold the bag across the seam so that the cut that was just made looks like a triangle. Then, cut a semicircle that goes from one end of the triangle to the other. This will create a round tip design.

Zum Verbot von Indymedia linksunten

Im August 2017 wurde Indymedia linksunten vom Bundesinnenminister verboten. Rechtsanwältin Kristin Pietrzyk berichtet von den Razzien, von der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Polizei und Geheimdiensten und gibt Einblick in das juristische Vorgehen gegen Verbot und Zensur.

Die wichtigste linksradikale Nachrichtenplattform linksunten.indymedia.org wurde im August 2017 von Bundesinnenminister Thomas de Maizière verboten. Um das Presserecht auszuhebeln, nutzte das Innenministerium das Vereinsrecht. Kurzerhand erklärten sie einige ihnen bekannte Freiburger Autonome zu Mitgliedern eines Vereins „Indymedia linksunten” und das Autonome Zentrum KTS Freiburg zum „Vereinsheim“. 

Um überhaupt erst gerichtsfeste Belege für das Vereinsverbot und die Zuordnung der Betroffenen zu diesem Verein zu beschaffen, wurden vier Wohnungen und das „Vereinsheim” durchsucht. Das aufgefundene Geld wurde kurzerhand als „Vereinsvermgögen“ deklariert und beschlagnahmt. Die beschlagnahmten Computer sollen von einer „Task Force“ des LKA Baden-Württemberg, der Bundespolizei und dem Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz „dekryptiert“ und im Erfolgsfall vom Inlandsgeheimdienst ausgewertet werden.

Eigentlich müsste anhand des Beispiels Indymedia linksunten politisch über Presse- und Meinungsfreiheit diskutiert werden. Über gezielte Verfassungsschutzhetze im Vorfeld des Verbots und über den Fallout des G20-Gipfels in Hamburg. Über den Aufstieg der rechtsradikalen AfD und einen deutschen Wahlkampf im Herbst 2017. Stattdessen wird der Fall als Folge eines Verwaltungsakts des Bundesinnenministeriums vor dem Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig verhandelt. Kristin Pietrzyk ist Rechtsanwältin aus Jena und vertritt dabei einen der Betroffenen.

Neben den juristischen wird sie auch auf folgende Fragen eingehen: Was hat eine verdeckte Kameraüberwachung mit einer linksradikalen Nachrichtenseite zu tun? Was können Fußnoten in Ermittlungsakten über Informanten des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz erzählen? Wieso liegt die Stickersammlungen jetzt beim Geheimdienst? Und warum wurde eigentlich nicht der alte BKA-Trick angewandt, durch den Zielpersonen mitten in der Nacht ihre Rechner freiwillig entschlüsseln?

Car buying isn't often a logic driven decision. It's often an emotional choice, and even used as a status symbol for the owner. Sometimes the badge on the front of the car is more important than how well it actually drives, and if the Kia Stinger isn't a total success, that's exactly what's to blame. 

The Kia Stinger GT is powered by a 3.3L twin turbo V6 engine producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft, with the option of RWD or AWD. The base model offers a 2.0L twin-scroll turbo I4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. I was able to drive the GT2 in both AWD and RWD, and it's a spectacular GT car. Plenty of power, predictable handling, a clean interior, and surprising practicality. But will your ego hold you back from a Kia badge?

Follow Vox's full coverage of the State of the Union here: http://bit.ly/2ElUHox

President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union speech on Tuesday, January 30, 2018 before congress.

The State of the Union address feels like a very old American ritual, and it is. It’s mandated by the Constitution, which says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”

On July 15, 1997, fashion designer Gianni Versace is entering his Miami Beach mansion when he is shot and killed by Andrew Cunanan. Seven years earlier, Cunanan meets Versace at a gay nightclub in San Francisco and tells his friends about the encounter the following morning, fabricating most of the details. Cunanan later attends a performance showcasing costumes designed by Versace and engages in a brief romantic exchange with him after the performance. In the present, Cunanan flees the scene, evading Versace's partner Antonio D'Amico and the local authorities. Versace, meanwhile, is rushed to the hospital only to be pronounced dead. As Miami Beach Police works with the FBI, Versace's sister Donatella and brother Santo begin planning the future of his business. Cunanan evades the authorities, changing clothes and purchasing multiple newspapers covering Versace's death with a remorseless expression.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nl7O-UvXpSg/sddefault.jpg,0.011600237953599048,0.0019333729922665077,6.0,0.006766805472932778,0.013533610945865556,0.02030041641879833,2018-03-16,00:52:54,Friday,4,9,43,9,42,54,378,1,81,0,1,7,5,2,2,5.0,8.0,"['‘a', '', '  ', '', 'isseaseansrenges']","['‘a', 'isseaseansrenges']",True,"['‘', 'a', 'isseaseansreng']",3,3,16,0,0,0,1,6.605128132059616,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Light-Based Laptops Can Run A Staggering 20 Times Faster
https://futurism.com/light-based-laptops-can-run-staggering-20-times-faster/
“We are rapidly approaching the limit to how small we can continue to make our transistors. Photonics could give us a boost up to fifteen times our current power and speed, even at the current transistor size.”

A Node By Any Other Name: What’s The Difference Between 16nm And 14nm?
http://semiengineering.com/a-node-by-any-other-name/
“Have you ever wondered what gives a particular CMOS technology node its name? When we talk about 20nm, 16nm or 14nm, what exactly does that number in front of the “nm” mean anyway? Is it the first layer metal half-pitch or the gate length (and while we’re at it, is that the printed gate length, the physical gate length, or the effective gate length)?”

The World's Smallest Transistor Is 1nm Long, Physics Be Damned
https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/6/13187820/one-nanometer-transistor
“The smaller your transistors, the more you can fit on a chip, and the faster and more efficient your processor can be. That's why it's such big news that a team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has successfully built a functional 1 nanometer long transistor gate, which the lab claims is smallest working transistor ever made.”

Letras españolas - kindly translated by Chiara Michieletto & Clara Sanchez-Pedreño:

Han pasado siete horas y quince días
desde que te llevaste tu amor
Salgo todas las noches y duermo todo el día
Desde que te llevaste tu amor
Desde que te fuiste puedo hacer lo que quiero
Puedo ver a quien yo elija
Puedo ir a cenar en un restaurante de lujo
Pero nada
y digo, nada, me puede quitar esta melancolìa
Porque nada se compara, nada se compara a ti
He estado tan sola aquí sin ti
Como un pájaro sin una canción
Nada puede parar estas lágrimas solitarias
Dime baby, donde me equivoqué
Podría poner mis brazos alrededor de cualquier chico que viera
Pero sólo me recordarían a ti
Fui al médico y adivina que me dijo? Adivina que me dijo?
Dijo: chica, es mejor que ententes divertirte No importa lo que hagas, pero él es un tonto
Porque nada se compara, nada se compara a ti
Todas las flores que plantaste mama
En el patio trasero
Todas murieron cuando te fuiste
Sé que vivir contigo, baby, a veces fue difícil
pero estoy dispuesta a darle otra oportunidad
Nada se compara
Nada se compara a ti
Nada se compara
Nada se compara a ti
Nada se compara
Nada se compara a ti

English Lyrics:

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
Guess what he told me?
He said girl you better try to have fun 
No matter what you do, but he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mama

No5cmnjtNag,RsGqQC2tRRM,"The Right Way To Eat Sushi, According To Renowned Japanese Chef Nobu Matsuhisa",Business Insider,26.0,2018-01-02 20:00:02+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'Sushi', 'Sushi roll', 'Wasabi', 'Nobu Matsuhisa', 'Nobu Restaurants and Hotels', 'Nobu: A Memoir', 'Sushi rice', 'Japanese', 'Japanese culture', 'Fish']",1288775.0,17291.0,548.0,892.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/No5cmnjtNag/default.jpg,"Nobu Matsuhisa, owner of Nobu Restaurants and Hotels and author of ""Nobu: A Memoir,"" shares how to eat sushi the traditional Japanese way.

Following is a transcript of the video; it has been edited for clarity.

Nobu Matsuhisa: I’m Nobu Matsuhisa, owner of Nobu Restaurants Group and Hotels.

Chef Matsuhisa opened his first restaurant in 1987 in Los Angeles; today he owns 47. And there are six Nobu hotels around the world.

Matsuhisa: You don’t need extra wasabi. Wasabi is always inside, between the rice and fish.

So you can use chopsticks or your fingers — it doesn’t matter. Use what's more comfortable.

OK, here is wasabi and the ginger. Normally, people take the wasabi and dip soy sauce here, right?

But for me, it means a more traditional way. A piece of the fish, dip — put the soy sauce and wasabi on the middle of the fish. Then not much soy sauce.

So these are the three ways: sashimi, nigiri, and roll.

Nigiri sushi. Make half-turn, take the chopstick and put soy sauce on the fish side. You can see no rice. Just a touch of the soy sauce on the top of the fish.

But now, ginger. A piece of ginger, after one bite, if you try the next one, some tuna or shrimp or whitefish, take one piece of the ginger. Clean the salmon taste, then try the next pieces.

So, the sushi roll. Take this one, and this is no choice. Put the soy sauce in the rice but just a little. Just a little, then one bite. So everything is one bite. Don’t bite two bites.

I think it’s better to eat more the light, then a little bit heavy. It means more fatty fish at the end.

The final sushi may be better as a roll, even more — a cucumber, not like a fish. So cucumber roll, oshinko roll, and sour prawns. This is my way. I like that.

DEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.

We’ve all heard the stories. She mates and then kills. Her venom is 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake’s. One bite could kill you.  With a shiny black color and a glaring red hourglass stomach, she has long inspired fear and awe.

But most species of widow spider (there are 31), including the western black widow found in the U.S., don’t kill their mates at all.  Only two widow spider species always eat their mate, the Australian redback and the brown widow, an invasive species in California.

And the male seems to be asking for it. In both of these species, he offers himself to her, somersaulting into her mouth after copulation.

He may even deserve it. During peak mating season, thousands of males will prowl around looking for females. Females set up their webs, stay put and wait.

Once the male arrives at her silken abode, he starts to wreck it, systematically disassembling her web one strand at a time. In a process scientists call web reduction, he bunches it into a little ball and wraps it up with his own silk.

Then, while mating, he will wrap her in fine strands that researchers refer to as the bridal veil. He drapes his silk over her legs, where her smell receptors are most concentrated.

After all of that, he is most likely to crawl away, alive and unscathed.

--- Why does the black widow spider eat her mate?

No one really knows, but scientists assume his body supplies her with nutrition for laying eggs. Sometimes she eats him by accident, not recognizing him as a mate.

--- How harmful are black widows to people?

We couldn’t find a documented case of a human death from a black widow spider in the U.S., but a bite will make you sick with extreme flu-like symptoms. Luckily, black widows aren’t aggressive to people.

--- Why do black widows have a red hourglass?

It’s a warning sign, a phenomenon common in nature that scientists call aposematicism, which is the use of color to ward off enemies.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nq3M15Sol0Q/sddefault.jpg,0.018916977388567714,0.0010604453870625664,17.838709677419356,0.0015325146238839669,0.01997742277563028,0.021509937399514248,2018-06-13,05:25:20,Wednesday,2,7,35,7,30,47,306,1,73,0,1,6,14,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.7843643948809325,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

But which international noodle brand reigns supreme? To help Sean Evans unpack the increasingly intricate world of mass-market noodle bowls, he's enlisted the help of Andrew and David Fung, the stars of the wildly popular YouTube channel Fung Bros. While taste-testing noodles from across East Asia, Sean, Andrew, and David slurp up instant soba from Japan before sampling Samyang's hot chicken flavor ramen—a dish made famous by last year's viral ""Korean Fire Noodle Challenge."" Finally, the guys taste-test Ichiran's ultra-luxe ramen kit before stepping into the Japanese chain's legendary solo dining booths. Does complete isolation really enhance the noodle-slurping experience? Is it ever worth dropping $39 on a three-pack of instant ramen? Is the Fire Noodle Challenge really all it's cracked up to be? Find out the answers to these important questions—and more!—on an all new episode of Sean in the Wild.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show.

Nu4DsKlKKMQ,rgcE2lMa0Kw,WFIRST Will See the Big Picture of the Universe,NASA Goddard,28.0,2017-12-22 15:51:46+00:00,[],67228.0,1466.0,53.0,133.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nu4DsKlKKMQ/default.jpg,"Scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will function as Hubble’s wide-eyed cousin. While just as sensitive as Hubble's cameras, WFIRST's 300-megapixel Wide Field Instrument will image a sky area 100 times larger. This means a single WFIRST image will hold the equivalent detail of 100 pictures from Hubble.

The mission’s wide field of view will allow it to generate a never-before-seen big picture of the universe, which will help astronomers explore some of the greatest mysteries of the cosmos, like why the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating. Some scientists attribute the speed-up to dark energy, an unexplained pressure that makes up 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos.

The Wide Field Instrument will also allow WFIRST to measure the matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon dictated by Einstein’s relativity theory. Massive objects like galaxies curve space-time in a way that bends light passing near them, creating a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. WFIRST will paint a broad picture of how matter is structured throughout the universe, allowing scientists to put the governing physics of its assembly to the ultimate test.

WFIRST can use this same light-bending phenomenon to study planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets. In a process called microlensing, a foreground star in our galaxy acts as the lens. When its motion randomly aligns with a distant background star, the lens magnifies, brightens and distorts the background star. WFIRST's microlensing survey will monitor 100 million stars for hundreds of days and is expected to find about 2,500 planets, well targeted at rocky planets in and beyond the region where liquid water may exist.

These results will make WFIRST an ideal companion to missions like NASA's Kepler and the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which are designed to study larger planets orbiting closer to their host stars. Together, discoveries from these three missions will help complete the census of planets beyond our solar system. The combined data will also overlap in a critical area known as the habitable zone, the orbiting distance from a host star that would permit a planet's surface to harbor liquid water — and potentially life.

By pioneering an array of innovative technologies, WFIRST will serve as a multipurpose mission, formulating a big picture of the universe and helping us answer some of the most profound questions in astrophysics, such as how the universe evolved into what we see today, its ultimate fate and whether we are alone.

You have to pay to use public toilets, and to drink water in Europe?! And cigarettes are fashionable?

It's about time someone addresses the cultural differences between the USA and Europe!

I just finished a 6 week Eurotrip -- which means I've now spent more than 1 year of my life in Europe, and visited every single country on the continent (yes, all 45 countries!)

While many things are similar about American and European culture, there are plenty of little (and BIG) differences that I'd like to bring to your attention in this video!

It took me 6 weeks of compiling this footage, writing this script, and editing this video... so I hope you like it! And if you enjoy, please share with your friends :)

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. “Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” upcoming “Dunkirk”).

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).
Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

Five NBA Championship Rings, 3 time MVP, and now an Oscar. 
Kobe Bryant, former Los Angeles Laker and one of the most famous basketball players in the world, retired from the sport he loved so much in 2016. In 2015 he wrote a letter called Dear Basketball announcing his retirement and describes basketball as QUOTE ""A love so deep I gave you my all/From my mind & body/To my spirit & soul."" Kobe then turned the poem into an animated short with the help of director Glen Keane who’s worked on movies like Aladdin and Beauty & the Beast. He was then nominated for an Oscar for the short and tonight the future hall of famer just won a golden statue. 

Kobe accepted the Oscar alongside director Glen Keane and started off his speech by saying how meaningful it is for him just be nominated and then took a jab at reporter Laura Ingraham – a reporter who recently made a comment towards LeBron James – telling him to QUOTE “Shut up and Dribble” because he’s JUST an athlete. 

Although many people were upset at the fact the Kobe Bryant was nominated in the first place, because he was accused of sexual assault back in 2003, others were excited for Kobe’s first Oscar like his former teammate Shaquille O’Neal. Shaw took to twitter to congratulate Mamba by saying QUOTE “Congrats to KOBE first Oscar that’s big bro #dearbasketball. Proud of you, Big honor for you and your family. I’m jealous lol while other fans pointed out the funny and obvious fact that QUOTE “Kobe Bryant has more Academy Awards than 5 time nominee Amy Adams AND Kobe Bryant has the same amount of Oscars as Leonardo DiCaprio! 

Congrats to Kobe on his first Oscar ever, and now I can’t help but think LeBron James is now thinking he’s now got to get two more rings, and an Oscar now to catch up to Kobe. I want to kick it over to you guys now though. What are our thoughts on Kobe Bryant winning an Oscar?

A mother and her inspiring six-year-old son who was born with a gap in his face is raising awareness of the treatment of people with facial differences. Christian Buchanan from Woodbury, Tennessee, was born with Tessier cleft lip and palate, a rare condition which has only been documented 60 times in medical history. Tessier cleft lip and palate is the result of the facial tissues not joining properly during development, causing a facial disfigurement and the inability to eat, speak and see.
