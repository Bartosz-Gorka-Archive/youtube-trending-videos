ABOUT RHOBH:
La La Land shines bright when Bravo Media's ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" returns for season eight. Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Lisa Vanderpump are joined by new housewife Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave and friend Camille Grammer for a season of lavish adventures, uncontrollable laugher and confrontations aplenty. Running her successful fitness and nutrition accountability business, newcomer Teddi moves through life with a strict ethos that she rarely strays from, even if this leads to differing opinions with some of the ladies. Friendly face Camille returns with a new outlook on life and is finally able to entertain the idea of remarrying, but when she struggles to get her ""sexy"" back, she turns to her friend Lisa Rinna for advice. This season, the ladies are busier than ever, juggling life at home and in the boardroom. In addition to wrapping production on her series ""American Woman"" and expanding her retail business, Kyle is at a crossroad when she has to decide whether to renovate or move out of the home where she's raised her daughters. Dorit gives herself just a couple months to re-launch her swimwear line, which proves to be a nearly impossible task. Erika pours herself into Erika Jayne's meteoric rise, back in the recording studio and opening up in shocking ways as she writes her autobiography. Meanwhile, Lisa Rinna is a focused ""momager"" to her two model daughters, who are poised to be the next ""it"" girls, but struggles to keep them grounded as they continue to travel the world and grow up very fast. Lisa Vanderpump is knee-deep in rescue dogs, as her new business, Vanderpump Dogs, continues to thrive, but will she be able to do it all once she also takes on editor of a magazine? From casual lunches to luxurious escapades, there's no doubt that living this large has its ups and downs, but these housewives have their famed zip code -- and then some -- in the palms of their hands.

“Love Ain’t” Complete Lyrics:
Hotels are made for two-night stays
Checkin’ in and out
Meetin’ strangers in the lobby
Wakin’ up and leavin’ town the next day
But love ain’t

And whiskey’s poured for when you’re bored
And alone on Friday night
When you wanna lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain’t

Chorus
Love ain’t you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain’t you callin’ me ‘cause he ain’t pickin’ up his phone
The way you’re talkin’, sounds like he’s somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is, girl
But I know what love ain’t
Come over, let me show you what he can’t
‘Cause he can only show you what love ain’t

Sad movies are for cryin’
On the couch there in the dark
That sad song, it was written
Just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain’t

Repeat Chorus

Love ain’t
Wonderin’ what he’s doin’
Love ain’t
Feelin’ like a fool and
You can’t
Keep lettin’ him do it to you
‘Cause

Repeat Chorus

Love ain’t

Chevy is at it again.  This time the focus group is on a busy freeway in a failed attempt to brag about their JD Power Dependability Award, which they received a 3 out of 5 in the Powertrain category (Engine & transmission problems). But lets be real here, that whole commercial was staged, if it was real life there'd be a lot of angry drivers on that freeway giving Chevy a piece of their mind.  So that's what we did.  Enjoy.

LYRICS
Do You Love Me

Don't know why I'm feeling so unsure
How much I wanna hold you makes me insecure
I'm finding myself wide awake while you are sleeping
I don't recognise myself, overanalysing

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Afraid that I'll wake up and you'll be gone
I feel like I've been waiting for something to go wrong
Have you everyday and you're still getting sweeter
But I'm still fighting with myself, overanalysing

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Morning comes, realise that I was crazy
But you're too good to be true
I've come undone, pinching myself lately
Losing sleep, asking myself

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Do you love do you love do you love me baby
When you kiss when you touch when you touch me baby
Do you love do you love do you love me baby
When you kiss when you touch when you touch me baby

Do you love me baby
Cause I think I see it in your eyes
When you kiss me baby, when you kiss me baby
Do you love me baby
Cause I think I feel it in your hands
When you touch me baby, when you touch me baby

Born in China, he trained as a technician in Taiwan before moving to the U.S. and setting up his own shop in downtown Manhattan in 1968. During this time, televisions began to evolve and video became an important part of the experimental art scene, especially for big players like Andy Warhol and John Lennon. But, over time, wear and tear and years sitting in museums can cause machinery to fail, which means the potential of losing priceless art forever. That’s where Chi-Tien Lui comes in. He’s become the go-to guy for institutions like the Smithsonian and MoMA to preserve these legendary electronics.

It all started in Baytown as a 911 call for a disturbance at about 7:45 a.m. Baytown police say 42-year-old Eric Brown reportedly threatened his wife with a gun and fired a shot. When officers arrived, the man got into the vehicle and took off, with police in pursuit.

Inmates are served healthy, nutritious meals of grilled fish, salads, rice and soup - which are actually healthier than most school lunches around the world! Would you like to try what prisoners eat? There's a prison in Hokkaido that serves authentic meals to the public and that is where I went -- Abashiri.

Abashiri is in the very north of Hokkaido and is famous for its prison. Their ""Bangaichi Shokudo Diner"" is the only restaurant that serves authentic prison food in Japan, the ingredients the same as the penitentiary nearby. The meals will probably surprise you!

Prison Food Menu:
SET A: Pacific Saury, 2 salads, barley rice, miso soup (780 yen / $7.00)
SET B: Atka Mackerel, 2 salads, barley rice, miso soup (820 yen / $7.50)

It's called the ""secret meal"" because Japanese Prisons are very restrictive with access to the outside world. However, Abashiri is dfferent and they've opened up prison life to the public and it's worth a visit.

We also get a tour of today's prison cells in Japan. They have tatami mats, futons, TV, toilet and window. There are private cells and cells for 6 or more inmates. Japanese inmates typically eat their meals in their cells.

The Japanese prison life is regimented, the schedule the same everyday. Wake up at 6:40am and lights out at 9:00pm.
Meal time is three times a day for 20 minutes.

Where is Abashiri, Japan?
It's in Hokkaido's north, a 90 plane ride from Tokyo's Haneda Airport.

I was planning to finish this video that I had started a while ago, but never got into it. Today, I decided
to make a new video (since I have a day off), but I'm a little sick, so I decided therefore to not make my
throat worse with a commentary. Instead, I just finished this video! :)

I hope you guys enjoy this one. I put quite a lot of time into it to make sure the scenes look as similar as possible
in terms of post processing. The models are from different authors, but I tried mixing them and finding the closest possible ones.

S2g0Vvyp8Ck,PKa01AvSATE,Raw: Democrat Doug Jones Celebrates Alabama Win,AP Archive,25.0,2017-12-18 05:17:52+00:00,"['AP Archive', 'apus089028', 'b4843911fe87b8c3f562a551942b7c72', 'US AL Jones Entrance (CR)', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'United States', 'Donald Trump', 'Roy Moore', 'Doug Jones', 'Government and politics']",334.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S2g0Vvyp8Ck/default.jpg,"(13 Dec 2017) In a stunning victory aided by scandal, Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama's special Senate election on Tuesday, beating back history, an embattled Republican opponent and President Donald Trump, who urgently endorsed GOP rebel Roy Moore despite a litany of sexual misconduct allegations.
It was the first Democratic Senate victory in a quarter-century in Alabama, one of the reddest of red states, and proved anew that party loyalty is anything but sure in the age of Trump. It was a major embarrassment for the president and a fresh wound for the nation's already divided Republican Party.
The victory by Jones, a former U.S. attorney best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for Birmingham's infamous 1963 church bombing, narrows the GOP advantage in the U.S. Senate to 51-49. This imperils an already-uncertain Republican tax, along with budget and health proposals, and further injects tremendous energy into the Democratic Party's early push to reclaim House and Senate majorities in 2018.
Jones, 63, grew up in the working-class city of Fairfield, just west of Birmingham, an area where steel mills once belched smoke that left a rust-colored haze hanging over the metro area.

영국남자 X 유로스포츠 평창 애프터파티 다음 게스트로 프리스키선수 두분을 모셨어요. 스키 슬로프에선 세상 용감한 선수들인데 음식에 있어선 엄청 겁쟁이들이더라고요!! (심지어 한분은 버거에 빵, 야채, 고기만 넣고 치즈랑 소스를 빼고 드신대요!!)

그래서 제가 제일 좋아하는 한국 음료를 드려보기로 했어요- 특히 제가 유럽에도 팔았으면 좋겠다고 생각했던 특별한 한국음료들로!!

For our next guests on our Korean Englishman X Eurosport PyeongChang Afterparty we have two Free-skiers. They are two of the bravest skiers you'll find on the slopes, but we found out that they only eat the most BORING food!! (One of them even only eats burgers with bread, salad and meat - no cheese or sauce!!!)

So we decided to give them some of my favourite Korean drinks - specifically some of the more unique Korean drinks that I wish they also sold in Europe!!

I absolutely love an ASOS haul, both doing them and watching them, so I hope you do too :) Let me know below what your favourite piece was, hopefully we're in sync haha!

Hailee Steinfeld is a powerhouse in many different areas. Because you’ve probably seen her movies and heard her songs, you might think that you know everything about her. But you are very, very wrong. Here are 20 Things You Didn’t Know About Hailee Steinfeld.

Hailee was rumored to be dating Justin Bieber for a while. It all started when he showed the paparazzi his phone while he was FaceTiming Hailee. Scandalous, right? TMZ reported that these two met through their church. They were reportedly introduced by their pastor Carl Lentz. The relationship was short-lived though, as Hailee is now with someone else. And Bieber is constantly dating other people, so their split was probably for the best.

Whether it’s about her dating life, her music career, or her many awards, there are a lot of things you would never have guessed about this singer. Stay tuned to 20 Things You Didn’t Know About Hailee Steinfeld to find out who she’s dating now!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S60aGfOuyA0/sddefault.jpg,0.015901943318366085,0.0005908124125143157,26.915384615384607,0.0009634787034848844,0.016492755730880403,0.017456234434365284,2018-02-26,21:00:01,Monday,0,8,34,8,24,48,270,1,31,0,0,6,22,3,4,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.2355376461580745,3,"['happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,3,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

To learn more, start your googling with these keywords: 
Domesticated animal: a species of animal bred by humans over generations to become nonreactive and gain characteristics suitable for life as a farm animal or pet

Tame animal: an individual animal raised in a way that it has become less dangerous and frightened of people

Feral animal: an animal that escapes from captivity or domestication (& regains some similar & some different characteristics compared to its pre-domesticated state)

""Fight or flight"": an instinctive physiological response to a threatening situation that readies a creature to either to resist forcibly or escape

Limbic system: the brain’s “panic button” - a system of nerves and networks near the bottom of the cortex that controls basic emotions (e.g. fear, pleasure, anger) and drives (e.g. hunger, sex, dominance)

Telencephalon: the most developed and anterior part of the forebrain, consisting chiefly of the cerebral hemispheres, and the brain region that shrinks most in domesticated animals

Domestication: a sustained multigenerational, mutualistic relationship in which one species (e.g. humans) assumes a significant degree of influence over the reproduction and care of another species (e.g. cows) in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of interest (e.g. milk/meat/traction), and through which the domesticated organisms gain advantage over individuals that remain outside this relationship (e.g. aurochs, which went extinct), thereby benefitting and often increasing the fitness of both species involved

The pushrod V8 engine is an icon in the world of American muscle. It still powers the torque monsters inside Chevy Camaros and Corvettes, as well as Dodge Chargers and Challengers. And while it's not to say that the engines aren't performance bargains, one might be curious why the redline on these engines tends to be fairly lower than their European counterparts. 

Again, this isn't to say that one technology is superior in every way, there are pros and cons of most engine styles. But from a curiosity standpoint, it does make one wonder why pushrod V8 engines aren't hitting 9,000 RPM in production cars, like DOHC V8's and flat-sixes. Of course, high RPM is all about engines that are tuned to breathe well at high RPM, and as the video demonstrates, that's just not what pushrod OHV engines are all about.

Riding Blind: When you're riding a bit of trail you've not done before, think about walking it first, that way you won't be surprised about any difficult parts. Alternatively, why not follow a friend that knows the trail well.

Line Choice: Getting the right line through difficult sections is crucial for getting down trails safely. So make sure you really think about your line choice when you're out riding.

Cornering: You need different techniques for different types of corners. If you're cornering on flat, hardpack corners you really need to trust your tyres and drive them into the corners. On very loose corners, you will want to keep your weight central, and allow the bike to move under you.

Body Position: Always keep your arms and knees bent and look a good way down the trail. That way you will always be able to respond quickly to changing trail conditions.

 Let us know how you get on with these techniques in the comments below 👇

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

There are a number of characters who have gone by the name ""Captain Marvel"" over the years - and they've appeared in both Marvel and DC comic books.
One of them - Carol Danvers, the most modern version from Marvel's comics - is getting her own Marvel Cinematic Universe movie in 2019.
We're really excited about it - seriously, it's going to be amazing - because Danvers is an awesome character and the movie will introduce the shapeshifting Skrulls to the MCU, which could be absolutely pivotal to the plot of the entire franchise going forward (and she's set to be the most powerful superhero in the franchise, which is awesome).
In this video, we'll explain how Danvers came to be such a powerful superhero. These are the origins of Captain Marvel explained...
Carol Danvers worked for N.A.S.A. as the organisation's Security Director. She became friends with a co-worker who was actually the Kree super-agent Mar-Vell. When an old enemy of Mar-Vell's attacked him, he shielded Danvers from the resulting radiation. This resulted in her DNA becoming merged with his - and she gained similar powers to him as a result (super-strength, speed and durability, flight capabilities, and energy absorption, projection and manipulation).
She didn't immediately take the name ""Captain Marvel"". She has also been known as Ms. Marvel, Binary and Warbird.
She has been a member of the Avengers and various other superhero teams and organisations.
We hope you enjoy the video! Make sure you comment to let us know what you think - and don't forget to subscribe to the channel to be notified of our other great videos in the future.

You can find each street food in this satisfying video here:

01:03 Entering the Yucutan breakfast restaurant in Merida, Huevos Motulenos y Mas, to try their famous eggs breakfast, known as Huevos motulenos.

03:16 Trying the Mexican Breakfast AKA Huevos Motulenos for the first time

03:38 Trying the extremely spicy Mexican habanero chili pepper, it was so spicy!

04:59 Entering the local street food market in Merida (Lucas de Galvez Market), and finding the Mexican Tamales, here in Merida known as Tamales Colados, a corn flour steamed and wrapped with banana leaf and covered with spicy salsa.

06:21 Finding and trying Cochinita Pibil, a special Yucutan food found in Merida in this local street food market. It's like the most juicy pulled pork sandwich ever! The bread is so soft and the meat is so flavourful and tender!

09:35 Trying the famous Tacos al Pastor in Merida, a delicious Mexican street food found all over Mexico. These ones were a little dry but unfortunately. Found right outside the market.

14:38 We made our way to the beach right outside of Merida, in Progreso, to try a huge Yucutan seafood adventure feast! It was amazingly fresh and delicious! We ordered the Tikinchik fish, some fish tacos, octopus, and a fresh seafood ceviche!

We’ll bring you tales of what happens next when people win or lose – and find out some of the show’s secrets from those who work on it – starting with the team behind Quiz, the ITV drama devoted to Millionaire’s most infamous player, the so-called Coughing Major: https://smarturl.it/FinalAnswerPodcast",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBoO8DBNLaE/sddefault.jpg,0.009901702722711195,0.00028789997532285925,34.392857142857146,0.0008534177839927612,0.010189602698034057,0.011043020482026815,2018-05-10,21:30:00,Thursday,3,17,50,17,40,79,345,4,55,2,0,14,38,7,5,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.8034283586986035,2,"['scared', 'happy']",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

It all started this past February, when I went to the 9:30 Club, a 1,200 capacity music venue, to see what I thought was a show by rock guitarist Grace Vonderkuhn and her power trio from Delaware.

When I arrived for the unusually early 7:30pm show, I saw a long line of young teens wrapping around the block, mostly girls, and a fair smattering of adults who didn't look like the regular concert goers who head to the 9:30 Club on a weekday evening. And as you've likely guessed by now, the show I was about to witness was not the riff-rock guitar player we'd recently featured on All Songs Considered but a very different sort of wunderkind who won the hearts of millions as the 11th winner of America's Got Talent and, now, a Columbia recording artist.

Inside the club was a massively enthralled and enthused crowd and it didn't take long for me, one of the few older guys in the club, to also be completely swept away by her performance. It was a dazzling show that felt fresh, sincere, bold but also simple, with Grace on ukulele singing songs such as ""Moonlight,"" a song about a friend dealing with mental health issues, which she also performs here at my desk.

""She always has a smile
From morning to the night
The perfect poster child
That was once in my life
A doll made out of glass
All her friends think that she's great
But I can see through it all
And she's about to break""

Despite what I feel is my broad love of music, I was reminded how easy it is to get comfortable in the musical confines we devise for ourselves. It's easy to stereotype artists and perhaps be dismissive of something that falls outside our comfort zone. But Grace's show and music reminds me to keep my thoughts and judgements open. So, if you're about to pass on watching this one, figuring you're not going to connect with a young teen and her music, stop. Take a deep breath, open up your heart and let Grace VanderWaal enchant you with her unique talent.

Grace VanderWaal's current album is called Just the Beginning.

And catch their latest in maternal mortality reporting here: https://www.propublica.org/series/lost-mothers

Despite spending more per capita on health care than any other country, the U.S. has the highest rate of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth in the industrialized world. But what makes maternal healthcare in other affluent countries look so different than the U.S.? Among other things, midwives. Midwives in the U.S. participate in less than 10 percent of births. But in Sweden, Denmark and France, they lead around three quarters of deliveries. In Great Britain, they deliver half of all babies, including all three of Kate Middleton’s. So if the midwifery model works for royal babies, why not our own? Check out the video above to find out how midwives have been at the center of a culture war that’s deeply rooted in race and class in America.

You can find the original presentation here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FhJcNoazcHpCp_Rr6-yXluuVS_6CTzjMKs3ShM6nx6o/edit?usp=sharing

UPDATE Apr 12, 2018: As of this morning, TG removed all of Billy's scores, including non-DK ones, from their scoreboards.

UPDATE Mar 21, 2018: There's been some new information on this that's worth clarifying. The versions of MAME that produce the ""girder finger"" have now been verified as all versions prior to .122, depending on the refresh rate settings used. Additionally, Billy has admitted that the board swap video was staged as a stunt to promote Robert Childs' YouTube, and not as a verification mechanism. END UPDATE

CORRECTION: At some point in the video I describe the orientation of the 1.04M and 1.05M as incorrect. This point is overall correct, but my comments about it were not; they were not upright, but rather were simply rotated the wrong direction. They were essentially flipped 180* from what they should have been. END CORRECTION

I am not involved in the dispute! I only condensed the statements and arguments others have made. I'm happy to take corrections, but for specific and technical questions you are better off asking in the threads.

There's a halo of reverence around J Dilla, a producer and beatmaker from Detroit who made some of the most fascinating and influential beats in hip hop history. Before his early death in 2006, J Dilla worked with countless artists and producers - from Erykah Badu and Janet Jackson to Busta Rhymes and Madlib - and developed an off-kilter style of rhythm and sampling that transcended the machine he used to create music, the Akai Midi Production Center, otherwise known as the MPC.

""In return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.

Politico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators—most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.

For more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)""*

Farrokh ""Freddie"" Mercury (5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer, songwriter and record producer, known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. He was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Killer Queen"", ""Somebody to Love"", ""Don't Stop Me Now"", ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", and ""We Are the Champions"". He led a solo career while performing with Queen, and occasionally served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.

Mercury was born of Parsi descent in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, and grew up there and in India before moving with his family to Middlesex, England, in his teens. He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.

In 1992, Mercury was posthumously awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and a tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London. As a member of Queen, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2002, he was placed number 58 in the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He is consistently voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music.

So here's how my experiment went down. The fishing line I bought was 1329 yards (3987 ft.) When the line ran out I was pretty disappointed thinking it's just dangling but the iPhone footage shows it seems to have hit something.

I assume the line just kept unraveling despite the phone landing, unless it just landed on a ledge or something and actually was 4000 feet deep? Hard to tell but after the initial 2-3 second drag delay, the iPhone was going down pretty fast and for like a good three minutes.

Physics is very unfriendly to high center-of-gravity vehicles full of sloshing water, particularly when combined with an adrenaline-fueled driver experiencing the tunnel vision that can set in when a call comes through. (A common theme in NTSB interviews: firefighters don't remember hearing the tilt alarm.) Did I mention that crash trucks often have a curb weight in excess of 100,000 pounds? Something to consider on those occasions where it seems as though fire rescue crews are taking forever to respond: They are useless if they don’t arrive.

Continuing....

On October 28, 2016, at 2:32 p.m. CDT, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N345AN), scheduled as American Airlines flight 383 bound for Miami, Florida experienced an uncontained right engine failure and subsequent fire during its takeoff ground roll on runway 28R at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. The flight crew aborted the takeoff and stopped the aircraft on the runway and an emergency evacuation was conducted. Of the 161 passengers and 9 crew members onboard, one passenger received serious injuries during the evacuation and another 19 experienced minor injuries.  The airplane was substantially damaged by the fire.

Here is some more information you likely have not heard elsewhere:

-It took firefighters ten hours to completely stop the fuel leak. To capture leaking fuel, firefighters first used eight containment pools, and eventually placed a fuel bowser beneath the wing. 

-Airport firefighters saw this fire from the station and started responding immediately, prior to notification from the tower

-One of the first units on scene included a firefighter who had been with Chicago Fire Department for 36 years. He had never before responded to an aircraft fire and was scheduled to retire the following day. At 11:00 in this video you can hear him saying ""I finally got my fire! Luckily no one was hurt.""

-Not all equipment was functional during the incident. Cameras which had recently been tested malfunctioned, and one of the high-reach extendible turrets on a crash truck was out of service. 

-One of the ejected turbine disc fragments pierced through the plane's wing and continued thousands of feet through the air, eventually falling through the roof of a UPS shipping facility, bouncing off the floor, breaking it (the floor, that is), and finally landing on a loading rack - over 3,000 feet away. Check out the photo album at http://tiny.cc/AA383Pics (case sensitive).

-Firefighters used over 24,000 gallons of finished foam (720 gallons of 3% AFFF concentrate) on this fire.

-The estimated cost to repair runway damage due to heat and gouges from flying turbine shrapnel was close to $1,000,000. It was necessary to cut a section of runway out of the ground.

(Noise reduction was liberally applied to the audio track, including frequency-specific notch filters for the ear-piercing high-pitch tones. The way it sounded prior... could be used for riot control.)

Many additional documents from the NTSB investigation have been added to Google Drive - flight crew checklists, training manual excerpts, interview transcripts, metallurgy reports on the failed disc, and more.

So long story short, Jimmy is going to play basketball with Ted Cruz.

A semiaquatic species, these creatures spend the majority of their time in shallow waters and can be found along the Atlantic coastline of North America. Their ten eyes help them stay oriented while swimming, and their hard shell protects them from turtles and sharks. Horseshoe crabs have long been harvested for their blood, which has helped prevent illnesses around the world. Sadly, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, their populations are quickly dwindling in the wild.

This makes it simply for a homeowner or an employee to use one product on many types of grasses to control many types of weeds.

Hammerhead pups are born live, after a 9-10 month gestation. Litters can number 30 or more. To afford the pups protection, hammerhead mothers give birth in coves. After that, the young are on their own. Found in November 2017, the Santa Cruz Island site further adds to the archipelago's importance as a habitat for this endangered species. The team's research and tagging will aid conservation.

1) Incredibles 2 Characters, Plot and Voice Actors Unveiled

2) Ryan Reynolds’ Maximum Effort Makes 3-Year Fox Deal; First Up Is ‘Clue’ With ‘Deadpool’ Scribes Reese & Wernick

3) John Cena in Talks to Star in 'Duke Nukem'

4) Chris Hemsworth Joins Danny McBride in ‘Dundee’ with Another Mysterious New Trailer

5) Original ‘RoboCop’ Writer Penning New Sequel To Exist in Original Continuity

6) Mail Bag 

7) Live Twitter Questions

Disney and Pixar revealed the official cast list, with new character details and plot elements for their upcoming Incredibles 2.  From writer-director-actor Brad Bird, The Incredibles 2 will see Helen (voiced by Holly Hunter) in the spotlight now leaving Bob (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet and Dash to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. 

Deadline is reporting that Fox has made a three-year first look deal with Ryan Reynolds and his Maximum Effort production company to create new projects for the studio. Up first will be a live action film based on the Hasbro board game Clue. The film will be developed as a star vehicle for Reynolds, and will be based on the mythology of the original board game. 

AGREE / DISAGREE 

THR reports that John Cena is in negotiations to star in Duke Nukem, a big-screen adaptation of the popular video game franchise at Paramount Pictures.  Platinum Dunes, the company run by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, will produce, with a director and writer yet to be attached. 

Last week, the internet was stunned to learn about a new movie entitled Dundee: The Son of a Legend Returns Home, when a trailer was revealed starring Danny McBride as Crocodile Dundee’s son. Now, a new trailer has appeared on the updated official website, introducing Chris Hemsworth as “Wally Jr.”

Could there be another RoboCop movie, set in the original continuity and not a reboot? There’s a chance, if the original co-writer is to be believed. In a new interview with Zeitgeist Entertainment Magazine, Ed Neumeier, who co-wrote the original RoboCop, revealed that he’s working on a sequel.

Love it or hate it, Mean Girls is a pop culture icon. But there's a huge difference between watching a movie about high school when you're in high school, and watching it as an adult. While you may now be able to fully appreciate the satire, some things aren't quite as funny…

SPZjmwNQBuM,Nt3shY9FGDI,Why Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall fell out,Dongo NEWS,22.0,2018-02-12 15:07:59+00:00,"['million', 'sarah', 'city', 'sjp', 'felt', 'jessica', 'sex', 'fell', 'kim', 'series', 'parker', 'film', 'cattrall']",154180.0,306.0,204.0,119.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SPZjmwNQBuM/default.jpg,"To the uninformed observer, it was a compassionate message of warmth and support for an old friend at a dreadful time of loss.The post from actress Sarah Jessica Parker on social media read: 'Dearest Kim, my love and condolences to you and yours and Godspeed to your beloved brother.Xx'  She was responding to the announcement by Kim Cattrall, her former Sex And The City co-star, that Kim's brother, Chris, 55, had been found dead on his farm in Canada.What it unleashed in return has shocked much of Hollywood and millions of Sex And The City fans worldwide.Kim responded with a furious attack that seemed, if not irrational, then certainly out of proportion.Writing on Instagram, she said: 'My Mom asked me today 'When will that @sarahjessicaparker, that hypocrite, leave you alone?'  'Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now.'Let me make this VERY clear (if I haven't already).You are not my family.'You are not my friend.So I'm writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona.' She linked her post to a 2017 newspaper story headlined: 'Inside the mean-girls culture that destroyed Sex And The City.' The language was such that one has to wonder if, even allowing for her obvious grief, Kim, 61, had rather taken leave of her senses.Clearly she felt blind fury that Sarah Jessica, 52 — known to all as SJP — was, in her view, yet again fostering her public image as a 'nice girl' offering support to her 'friend Kim' — and that muscling in on the Cattrall family's grief was a step too far.No one who has followed the relationship between the women was under the illusion it was very good — they are both known to have diva-ish tendencies and have been feuding on and off for years.But until this weekend the depth of hostility involved, on Cattrall's part at least, was unknown.It would seem the huge resentment she appears to feel towards SJP — over her status on the show, her salary and her influence — boiled over in that one, vitriolic rant.So is SJP entirely innocent or does Kim have grounds for her anger?  Certainly there were times when the 'mean girls' atmosphere on Sex And The City reached such a pitch that neither Queen Bee SJP nor the other two stars, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis, would speak to Kim.Not a word — beyond what the scripts demanded — despite 15-hour days filming together, for months on end.The three women would eat lunch apart from Kim, too, according to sources on set.When they were shooting out of town, they would stay in different hotels.There was no girly exchange of gossip while they were all having their make-up done.The reasons were many; over the years arguments raged over everything from status and money to the amount of nudity in love scenes.SJP got to keep her bra on, which rankled with Kim who, as sexually voracious Samantha Jones, was required to bare all at every opportunity.But essentially, it all boiled down to which a",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SPZjmwNQBuM/hqdefault.jpg,0.0019846932157218835,0.0013231288104812555,1.5,0.0007718251394473991,0.0033078220262031392,0.004079647165650538,2018-02-12,15:07:59,Monday,0,9,13,9,13,50,116,0,40,0,0,6,0,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.993621788762987,3,"['sad', 'neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,{'person': 3},3

Breaking them would seriously offend your Japanese friends or colleagues.

Have you ever dreamt of visiting Japan? Seriously, who hasn’t? It is famous for its high-speed trains, colorful cherry blossom and kimonos, yummy sushi and incredible etiquette rules. Apparently, there is a ceremony and a set of rules for even the most routine things in the Land of the Rising Sun.

SUMMARY
- To address people by name is not enough in Japan. Our usual Miss and Mister last name won’t work either. And even the respectful title “-san“ is only the tip of the iceberg. There are actually more appropriate suffixes for addressing or referring to different people.
- Exchanging business cards is a whole ritual. Make sure your card’s front side is facing your counterpart. Offer it with both hands. If your rank is lower than your partner’s, hold the card lower than they do.
- The Japanese believe that ""You can easily break a single arrow, but not ten in a bundle."" In other words, group solidarity is much more important than individual success to them. 
- Timekeeping means so much to the Japanese they are surrounded by clocks. Every park, store and even many of the billboards have clocks in them. When a train is one minute late, the railway company will make an announcement with their sincere apologies. 
- If you are a tourist in Japan, try not to be the first to enter an elevator! Unless you really want to be the captain. The position is not paid though, and you don’t get a cool captain’s hat. 
- On the subway, there are some restrictive rules that the Japanese are expected to follow: talking is not allowed (on the phone as well), and it’s impolite to stare at others.
- In Japan, it’s rude to look people in the eyes, let alone touch them. This country is not very large, so every Japanese person respects the personal space of others. 
- If you visit a Japanese home, prepare to take your shoes off before you enter. You will get slippers instead. 
- One thing to remember here is that you can’t bring your own food or drinks to the stall (which makes sense) and you can’t occupy your table for too long as there are other people waiting. 
- The Japanese have a strange attitude toward money: for some reason, they are embarrassed to show it in public. Therefore, money envelopes decorated in a traditional manner are very popular here. 
- If you are a tourist or a senior and spread out your legs, you’ll certainly get away with it, and no one will say anything. But it would be unimaginably inappropriate for a Japanese person to sit so.
- You have to be very careful if you want to give someone flowers in Japan. Lilies, lotus blossoms, camellias and any white flowers, in general, are reserved for funerals. Potted plants will not be appreciated because of superstitions. 
- The art of bowing is so important in this country that children learn it at an early age. 
- In Japan, a customer or business partner is almost a god and is treated with incredible respect. When they leave, the whole company follows them to the door or elevator and keeps bowing until the doors are closed.

Watch a sneak peek at Disney’s A Wrinkle In Time.

----
Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres March 9th!
From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.

Hi A.R.M.Ys! ☜(˚▽˚)☞ I'm back with another video ʘ‿ʘ 
----------------------
BTS 'You Laugh = You Lose' Challenge or just BTS 'Try Not To Laugh' Challenge.
I feel like many of you really enjoy these types of videos, so I decided to make another one. I tried really hard to make this video entertaining, so I hope that you will appreciate it.❤️ 
In this video I included only moments from AMA’s 'era' when they were in the States. 
----------------------
🎉 GIVEAWAY WINNERS are tAECCI and Daniella Esmeraldo. 
I've already paid for their albums, and after about a month they'll arrive to winners houses. 
A big thanks to all giveaway participants, if I could I'd give each one of you an album.. But I think that I'll make more giveaways in the future too, so look out for it :) 
----------------------
DISCLAIMER: By making this video I didn't mean to mock or laugh at BTS in any way. It's just for fun, so don't take it too seriously :)

Pencilmation is a cartoon channel for not-too-serious grown-ups. It is made with love and a lot of fun by an international team helmed by Ross Bollinger who started the channel alone in his room a long time ago.

In 1912, a fossil collector discovered some strange bone fragments in the eerie, beautiful Cretaceous Bahariya rock formation of Egypt. Eventually, that handful of fossil fragments would reveal to scientists one of the strangest dinosaurs that ever existed -- the world’s only known semi-aquatic dinosaur.

Thanks as always to Nobumichi Tamura for allowing us to use his wonderful paleoart: http://spinops.blogspot.com/

Steve Lacy is the youngest member of the band The Internet. When he was only 16 years old, he co-produced their Grammy-nominated LP, Ego Death. After graduating high school and turning 18 years old last year, he traveled the world from Fuji Rock Japan to Splendor in The Grass (Australia) to Bonnaroo. He is now home in Compton, California, collaborating with and producing for artists including Kendrick Lamar, Mark Ronson, Vampire Weekend and Tyler The Creator, and has projects in market with J. Cole, Big Sean, Syd, and more.Steve’s refers to his first solo project as a “song series”, a sampling of the breadth and depth of his talents that breaks away from the traditional EP or LP format – less a structured body of work, and more like a series of sketches that might hang on a gallery wall.

What are some of the best cruelty free brands to try? How can you tell if something is cruelty free? What's the difference between vegan and cruelty free? What's the deal with China? I interviewed Cruelty Free expert Courtney, aka Phyrra Nyx, to find out the answers to these questions and more (in a TOTALLY not preachy way)!

Introduction to Courtney 1:20
Lids By Design - https://contoursrx.com/eyelid-lift-strips/

What is cruelty free 3:13

What’s the difference between cruelty free and vegan? 3:52

Are there different beliefs or levels of being cruelty free? 5:45

What are some popular mainstream cruelty free brands? 6:43

What are some good resources for learning which brands are cruelty free? 7:13

If I see a “bunny” on packaging does that mean it is 100% guaranteed to be cruelty free? 8:22
(Additionally, I've seen some fake bunnies out there that are just straight made up!)

Why are more indie brands than mainsteam brands cruelty free? What are some of your favorite cruelty free indie brands? 13:06
(Indie brands are independently owned, which means they don't have a parent company that owns many brands.)

What’s the deal with products made in or sold in China? 15:28
A good article on this - https://logicalharmony.net/animal-testing-and-china/

What’s the deal with L’Oreal and other brands who make cruelty free claims, but also sell in China? 19:45

How can I start going cruelty free? Do I have to throw away my makeup that isn’t cruelty free? 22:39

Can you be cruelty free for makeup, but not vegetarian or vegan? 23:22

Can you be a cruelty free in makeup but not in medication? 25:53

Most if not all ingredients were tested on animals at one point or another, so is makeup ever really cruelty free? 27:37

If I can’t be 100% cruelty free, should I bother? 30:23

This Video talks about different kinds of risks that is associated in metal industry. So. that we can aware you about safety instructions.
As you know safety of workers or individuals are primary concern for TTI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10 Slag Explosions
Slag or metal waste is the waste material that remains after Ore-Purification. And that won't be used in the metal processing.
Generally when metal impurities mix with water, for instance, a big explosion may occur.

#9 Electric Arc Furnaces
The electric arc furnaces have been substituting traditional furnaces in many steel plants worldwide.

#8 Boiler Explosion
Boilers are very important in the metal industry. They are defined as a closed pressure vessel where a fluid is heated by applying the resulting heat externally.

#7 Fires
One of the hazards to be considered in the metal industry is fire. Fire increases the possibilities for accidents to occur.

#6 Moisture
Water entry or just simple moisture in the boiler can produce bad results that could put at risk the worker’s live in the metal industry.

#5 Slag Dumping
We cannot consider the slag dumping as an accident, but the consequences of this action can be very negative. Slag or waste originate from ore smelting to purify metals.

#4 Steel Casting ladle break
Broadly speaking, the steel casting ladle is a tool used in the metal refining and casting.  it is used to transport and pour the red hot metal.  They are made of steel and have a refractory lining to withstand high temperatures.

#3 Molten Metal Splashes
One of the most common risks in metal smelting are the splashes of molten metal.  It is in fact one of the points for risk prevention.

#2 Eruptions in Metal Casting Centres
A very risky event is the metal casting process. This process consists of pouring the smelted metal into a cast for it to become solid.

#1 Fire Loops or Cobble
this kind of accident can be lethal for workers who are near. The temperature of this kind of molten metal loops is extremely high.

That is not the only Cinematic Universe in peril though, as on November 8th, the plug was pulled on the current iteration of Universal’s Dark Universe, the cinematic universe consisting of the classic Universal Monsters like Frankenstein and Dracula, which begun (and ended) with «The Mummy».

In this video, @AndreEinherjar will first cover the collapse of the Dark Universe, and what might be next for the Universal monsters. Next to bediscussed is the bigger of issue that outside of Marvel, pretty much everyone that have tried to launch a cinematic universe of their own have failed – and why this might be the case.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

Can you believe it's been THREE whole years since I started this channel already!? I couldn't have gotten here without all of my VIPs! That's why, this week, I couldn’t miss the opportunity to show you all how much I love each and every one of you by baking this adorable Teddy Bear Cake - it's sweet on the outside AND the inside, just like all of YOU! To make this Giant Teddy Bear Cake, I baked 12 lbs of my Ultimate Vanilla Cake batter with pink food colouring. I covered the cake in SWEET chocolate fondant, and added pink and red decorative details! To top it all off, I even crafted a chocolate heart & filled it with TONS of cinnamon hearts.

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

As Blake says, his hardtail differs slightly to what yours may be at home, featuring more aggressive angles, a beefy wheelset and a low bottom bracket that makes it perfect for his kind of riding! But this just proves that if you adapt your riding to suit the bike, you can ride a lot on a hardtail!

But when the teenage Anna is suddenly thrust into the real world under the protection of no-nonsense police officer Ellen (Liv Tyler), it soon becomes clear that the young woman is far from ordinary. Unable to adjust to a normal life, Anna finds herself drawn instead to the wild freedom of the forest while struggling to resist the growing bloodlust that has awakened inside her. This moodily atmospheric thriller combines supernatural scares with a myth-like tale of self discovery.

A dark fantasy tale that follows a mysterious nanny put in charge of an inquisitive young girl, Noa, and her little brother, Michael.  When Noa becomes suspicious that her new nanny, played by Jaime Murray, could very well be an evil faerie from a dark underworld she pleads her case to anyone that will listen. As Noa seeks answers in hopes to reveal the true identity of her eerie caretaker she finds the truth is much more twisted than she could have ever imagined.

Directed by: Armando Iannucci
Starring: Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Jason Isaacs, Rupert Friend, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko & Jeffrey Tambor

The one-liners fly as fast as political fortunes fall in this uproarious, wickedly irreverent satire from Armando Iannucci (Veep, In the Loop). Moscow, 1953: when tyrannical dictator Joseph Stalin drops dead, his parasitic cronies square off in a frantic power struggle to be the next Soviet leader. Among the contenders are the dweeby Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), the wily Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi), and the sadistic secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale). But as they bumble, brawl, and backstab their way to the top, just who is running the government? Combining palace intrigue with rapid-fire farce, this audacious comedy is a bitingly funny takedown of bureaucratic dysfunction performed to the hilt by a sparkling ensemble cast.

Slow Cooker Chili
 
Yields: 6 servings
Prep Time: 15 minutes
Total time: 8 hours and 15 minutes
 
Ingredients:
 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound ground beef 85%
1 yellow onion, small diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 - 28 ounce can diced tomatoes
1-15 oz can pinto beans
1 cup vegetable juice, like V8
1 cup frozen corn
2 tablespoons ancho chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
¼ cup fine almond meal (flour) or cornmeal
 
Toppings:
1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/3 cup sour cream
 
 
Directions:
 
In a large skillet on medium high heat, add oil. When hot add beef and onion, sauté for about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and add to the inner pot of a crock pot. Add garlic, can tomatoes, beans, vegetable juice, frozen corn, ancho chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper, stir until all combined. Set slow cooker for 8 hours on low.
Remove lid. Stir in ¼ cup almond meal. Let sit for 10 minutes, to absorb the cornmeal and thicken.  Ladle into bowls, top with cheese and sour cream. If packing up to freeze. Let cool completely and remove to storage containers. Can freeze up to 3 months.
Chef note: almond meal (flour) gives this a nutty flavor. Can substitute cornmeal too. Because a lot of condensation collects from the lid, these interchangeable ingredient will help thicken the chili.

LYRICS

And we were bold
Over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had ahold
of the lightning strikes
When we should have been afraid of heights
And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
cause I knew I couldn't catch you
so I left the sky
and I fell behind

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
but when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

If I was whole
I'd turn right now
I'd forget it and just walk away
Cause I've been told
That I'm dragging it out
But I've been dying just to see your face
And all I wanted was to say goodbye
into the fortress and you're stuck behind
And in the silence now I realize
That after all
That I built the wall

All these broken souls
They never make me whole
They don't know my heart

All these broken souls
Each one more beautiful
They don't know my heart

I'll send out my soul
To worlds more beautiful
But they won't know my heart
It's the darkest part

In this weeks Chapter of I Love My Baby, But.. we discuss the daunting task of SONNY STARTING SOLIDS. Our doctor said we could start giving Sonny solids at 4 months but we waited all the way until 6.5 months. This was just one of those things I took my time digging into and now we are on a roll, largely in part to @yumi- a baby food company delivering the freshest, most delicious food right to your doorstep. The thought of having to spend the time shopping, chopping, cooking, pureeing and cleaning up was way too overwhelming for me. I don't even do that for Timmy and I. I'm a working mom so I am constantly looking for ways to save time. @Yumi has done all the research to give me peace of mind so I never have to worry - is he getting enough. 

All of Yumi's food is nutritionally balanced, and most importantly low in sugar. It's so overwhelming to see all of the baby food brands at the store these days that claim they are a fresh and healthy option - but you would be SHOCKED to find how much sugar is hidden inside. Yumi is the first product I have found that makes meal time an easy, worry-free experience. They have over 50 flavors so your baby gets a wide variety of new and interesting foods (*show jars), and it feels so good watching Sonny gobble up this fresh food that is shaping his palate and nourishing his little mind and body. 

What I love the most is that this brand is thoughtful - you can tell that they really make it a priority to think about your experience with their product from start to finish. The jars are delivered in these cute color-coded trays which make it easy to keep track of in the fridge. Being a parent is stressful enough, and Yumireally checks off all the boxes for me. It’s super fresh, it’s nutritious, it’s low in sugar and convenient.

All you new moms don't need to stress about what you are going to put into your baby's body. Head to helloyumi.com to learn more and order!

Lyrics:
Verse 1

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Chorus

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it, I don’t deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Verse 2

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Bridge

There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sc6SSHuZvQE/sddefault.jpg,0.005022829512576914,0.00022952315843434112,21.88375912408759,0.00022690961006092817,0.005252352671011254,0.005479262281072182,2018-01-20,00:00:00,Saturday,5,5,10,5,10,36,87,2,20,0,0,5,0,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.553582315997883,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

L.U.V Lyrics :

[Verse 1]
Stole my heart and I fell for you
Always knew I'd come back for you
Time with you is not wasted time

Hurry for confection
Waiting for perfection
What I got to do to make you mine?


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh woah
Something about your hope
It’s making me want to know
How far I can take it

Oh woah
Don’t want to take it slow
Just give it another go and
We can
We can


[Chorus]
Give it all
We can give it all
I’ll give you that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V
 

Give it all
You can give it all
Give me that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

(Instrumental)
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V


[Verse 2]
I will sell my soul for you
Put myself through hell for you
Loving you's my only sin

Cutting through the tension
That’s my only intention
Just trying to let you let me in


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh woah
Something about your hope
It’s making me want to know
How far I can take it
 

Oh woah
Don’t want to take it slow
Just give it another go and
We can
We can


[Chorus]
Give it all
We can give it all
I’ll give you that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

Give it all
You can give it all
Give me that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

(Instrumental)
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
L.U.V
 


[Bridge]
I don’t wonder why
Oh who was wrong
Oh
We just need to keep on holding on
Woah

I got a billion stars up above me
Solid on the ground
Baby we ain’t got no limits
So tell me are you down
We just need to keep on holding on
Woah


[Final Chorus]
Give it all
We can give it all
Give you that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

Give it all
You can give it all
Give me that
L.U.V
Give me that
L.U.V

(Instrumental)

As a matter of fact, the rocket that took humans to the moon, the Saturn 5, was 111 meters or 363 feet tall, and had more separation events than dating teenagers.

So why do rockets always split themselves into multiple parts. Isn’t that complicated and risky? Why throw so much away? I mean, there’s got to be a better way!!!

Well how about if rockets were only ONE stage? How awesome would that be? Well this idea isn’t new… it’s called single stage to orbit or SSTO and it’s often considered the holy grail of rocketry.

Well, today, I’m going to SMASH THAT HOLY GRAIL and explain why I think SSTO’s SUCK.

In order to drill this point in we’ll teach you all about the tyranny of the rocket equation and help you understand why every orbital rocket, well, ever is multistage.

Then we’ll take a stroll down SSTO history and look at some crazy designs that in some cases almost worked...

And not to be a huge downer, we will take a look at some SSTO designs that MIGHT actually work, including the Skylon spaceplane that uses the awesome SABRE hybrid engine.

How does intermittent fasting work? Here's what actually happens to your body and brain when you fast. Following is a transcript of the video.

How long has it been since you last ate? People who fast intermittently often eat within an 8-hour block, leaving 16 hours of fasting in between. During that 16-hour stretch, their bodies undergo an important change that sets them apart from non-fasters.

Here's how it works.

When you eat, you store some of that energy in the liver as glycogen. But after 10-12 hours of not eating, your glycogen reserves will be extremely low. As a result, you may feel more irritable than normal, a term scientists call ""hangry.""

The upside is — with little glycogen left — fat cells in your body release fats into your bloodstream. The fat cells head straight to your liver, where they're converted to energy for your body and brain. So, you are literally burning fat to survive.

Blood samples show that people who had fasted for 12-24 hours experienced a 60% increase in energy from fat, with the biggest change occurring after 18 hours. This is the benefit to intermittent fasting because it puts you in a state called ketosis. And it's why researchers think intermittent fasting could be the key to a longer, healthier life.

The process of burning fat releases chemicals called ketones. In the brain, ketones trigger the release of an important molecule called BDNF. BDNF helps build and strengthen neurons and neural connections in areas of the brain responsible for learning and memory. Which could explain why a boost in ketone production has been shown to improve memory in people with early signs of dementia in as soon as 6 weeks. Increasing ketones in the body is also a common treatment for patients with severe epilepsy.

You don't necessarily have to fast to boost your ketone levels. Introducing more fatty foods into your diet and cutting back on carbs can have a similar effect. A group of people who tried this method for 3 months not only lost weight and body fat, but also saw a decrease in blood pressure and a hormone (IGF-1) that is related to aging and disease.

But scientists have discovered that fasting increases ketone levels more. Ketogenic diets can increase ketones 4-fold whereas fasting has been shown to increase ketones by up to 20-fold. As a result, fasting — compared to a ketogenic diet — may have a stronger, more beneficial effect on overall health.

Yet many Americans who eat three meals a day with snacks in between never reach ketosis, and therefore aren't producing enough ketones to promote good health.

Fasting and ketosis have been a key to our survival from the beginning. They helped our ancient ancestors survive through bouts of starvation.

And today, they're becoming recognized as a way to help keep future generations mentally and physically disease-free.

[ SEVENTEEN(세븐틴) ] 
 
SEVENTEEN is coming back with its special album ‘DIRECTOR’s CUT’. During the year of 2017, SEVENTEEN had a grip on the music industry by giving off the charm of all thirteen members and each unit of vocalists, hip hop and performance in their large-scale project ‘2017 SEVENTEEN PROJECT’. With this special album, SEVENTEEN wants to finish the long journey and express appreciation to the fans for their support.  
 
Last year, SEVENTEEN showed from ‘BEFORE Al1’, the first sorrow of ‘Al1’ and the subsequent loneliness and growth to ‘新世界’ and the starting point for the change of ‘TEEN, AGE’ in ‘2017 SEVENTEEN PROJECT’.   Now SEVENTEEN will return to the fans with its special album ‘DIRECTOR'S CUT’ that will be released on February 5.

FULL LYRICS:
You married a girl who can't pronounce your name
You chose her just the same, you did 
And I should have seen that shit and quit it
I should have packed a bag and split, I didn't 

The hands on the clock hit 12AM 
I'm out drinking all alone again 
I promised you I would cut this back 
Shit happens when you ain't got my back, ah 
And I an't had a cigarette since the last time with you 

I might not be good for you but I've been good to you 
I might not be right for you but I ran right for you when you needed someone 
So I'll be damned if you don't look me in my eyes
If you won't deign to explain why
I'll be damned, I'll be damned

I'll be right where you left me inanimate 
Turned my blood and bone to granite, you did 
Try not to turn back when you're walking
No good ever came from us two talking, just try

Him and I Lyrics ✍️🎤
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""Be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

My '65 speeding up the pch, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 bonnie and clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
Ysl dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my 
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)
He said ""Be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Him and I
Woah
Woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Woah
Woah
In the end, it's him and I

We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together, fuck up clubs together
And we'd both go crazy if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

[chorus]

This vlog contains an integrated paid for advertorial with L'Oreal Paris who I am very proudly an ambassador for! It's finally 2018 in the vlogs and it's New Years Day. I love New Year and always see it as a fresh start and the first page of a completely unwritten book for us all. I also announce some exciting L'Oreal news and head to the gym to start the year as I mean to go on - my usual cardio & abs workout!

The warm water reefs of the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea are well know, but they dont only occur in warm waters. In some of the oceans coldest, darkest depths they are thriving. The deep water reefs are formed by icebergs as they slide across the sea bed, leaving behind perfect foundations for coral to build upon. Hidden from view, they criss cross the planet from the deep water tropics to the freezing Arctic. Some have never been explored by humans. Underwater cameramen have ventured down to the pitch blackness to find life thriving. In this one hour HD special, our team will enter this alien environment. And discover a strange, hidden world abundant with life, from the weird to the wonderful.

▶ Directed by Dominic Cooke
▶ Written by Ian McEwan
Synopsis: It is summer 1962, and England is still a year away from huge social changes: Beatlemania, the sexual revolution and the Swinging Sixties. We first encounter Florence and Edward, a young couple in their early twenties, on their wedding day. Now on their honeymoon, they are dining in their room at a stuffy, sedate hotel near Chesil Beach in Dorset.
Their conversation becomes more tense and awkward, as the prospect of consummating their
marriage approaches. Finally, an argument breaks out between them. Florence storms from the room and out of the hotel, Edward pursues her, and their row continues on Chesil Beach. From a series of flashbacks, we learn about the differences between them – their attitudes, temperaments and their drastically different backgrounds. Out on the beach on their fateful wedding day, one of them makes a major decision that will utterly change both of their lives forever.
ON CHESIL BEACH is a powerful, insightful drama about two people, both defined by their upbringing, bound by the social mores of another era.

You would think that Lamar Odom would have learned by now that if you mess with one Kardashian, you mess with the whole family.

Kim Kardashian just totally shaded Khloé Kardashian’s ex using only using five words.

It’s no secret that that Kardashian clan stands up for each other and are protective over what it said about their family. Kim Kardashian proved that to be true once again when she seriously called out Khloe Kardashian’s ex-husband, Lamar Odom, after he made comments about his marriage to Khloe.

Lamar was a guest on BET’s Mancave and spoke candidly about his relationship with Khloe saying that he still had her name tattooed on him for QUOTE “no reason” and how he knew that they were really over.

Lamar went on to say QUOTE “I understand when it’s over, it’s over. When she was with her second or third NBA ball player, I could see that.”

When someone tweeted out saying that Lamar’s comment was a burn towards Khloe, Kim couldn’t NOT say something and added in her own caption to the story.

Kim quoted the tweet saying QUOTE “or second or third brothel”.

Now if you don’t know why this shade is so extreme it’s because in October 2015 Lamar was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel and had to be rushed to the hospital where he was near death being in a coma for four days.

Khloe stayed by his side and even temporarily called off their divorce proceedings. Lamar then completed a 30 day drug rehab program.

After Lamar fully recovered, Khloe re-filed for divorce and their split was finalized in December 2016.

Are you living for Kim’s shade and do you think that Lamar’s comments are wrong? Let me know in the comments below and then click here to see why people are freaking out over Kylie Jenner’s latest Home delivery. I’m Renee Shaffi, thanks for tuning in!

Over the last few months, i've probably eaten some version of this noodle soup at least 4-5 times every week. You can pretty much get every single item you need in this one dish for a healthy diet, not to mention a warm bowl of delicious broths and noodles is extremely satisfying. By making this at home, you get to take inspiration from all of those incredible Asian cuisines out there and create your perfectly balanced noodle dish! #noodlesoup #comfortfood

As you watch this video, A cherry red Tesla Roadster travels in space, and Starman the mannequin sporting SpaceX sleek spacesuit is in the driver’s seat, where it will sit for millions of years. 
And in a deeper sense, Starman serves as a metaphor to Elon Musk’s path to greatness.
We will get to all of that in a minute.
Our Journey starts in 2001, when everything began.
Elon Musk was 30 years old. 
Musk originally didn’t set out to start an Aerospace Company.
He merely wanted to get the public excited about space again, namely, excited about going to Mars, and he was willing to spend his own money to do so!
So, he came up with an idea called the Mars Oasis, which consisted of a small greenhouse that would be sent to and land on Mars, and with that, would be the farthest that life has ever traveled. 
The greenhouse would send video feedback to earth so people could watch it grow.
By getting the public excited about going to Mars, Musk hoped that such a mission would eventually lead to additional NASA funding needed for a manned Mars Mission.
Musk wanted to finance, two missions in case the first one failed, he was not a billionaire at this time but he was willing to spend up to $30 million on the missions. 
But Musk ran into a big problem, finding a rocket that can send the small greenhouse to Mars within his budget. 
The cheapest US rocket was $65 million and was way too expensive. 
But Musk was determined to accomplish this meaningful mission, so he took a coach flight to Moscow to buy an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile at a much cheaper price than a US launch vehicle.
Musk brought along Adeo Ressi his best friend from college and Jim Cantrell who was a consultant and worked on various joint missile defense programs conducted between America and Russia in the past, and is now the co-founder of Vector Space Systems.
They set up meetings with various companies, to include Kosmotras, a commercial rocket launcher based in Moscow. 
All of the meetings were unsuccessful, the Russians did not take Musk seriously, and according to Cantrell, one of the chief designers spat and him and Elon because he thought they were full of it, and Musk returned without a rocket. 
And then in February 2002 Musk and his team went back to Moscow with reinforcements in the name of Mike Griffin who worked for In-Q-Tel which was the venter capital arm of the CIA and also worked for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab.

What does it take for us to see that the current model needs to be redesigned? For Jay Gosselin it took 12,000 heartbreaking conversations with students to fully understand how badly our model for educational transitions needs to be overhauled. 
 ""Create a life that feels good on the inside, not one that just looks good on the outside."" Jay Gosselin, the founder of MentorU and the Discover Year Program is striving for significance.

Jay uses his own non-traditional career path to demonstrate how action, openness, and authenticity are foundational principles when building a purposeful career and life. Jay has travelled to 51 countries, held 19 different jobs, and lived in 7 Canadian cities. His greatest lessons have come through dozens of job rejections, being cut from competitive sports teams, and an abandoned wedding engagement. The combination of insights Jay has gathered from meeting over 13,000 students, conducting research in psychology and education, and his own experiences, enable him to create meaningful programming for young adults striving to build purposeful lives.

To pursue his passion for helping others reach their potential, Jay returned to school at the age of 30, and is currently completing a Master’s degree in educational counselling in his spare time. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Additionally, Nick Wright questions if Cleveland's Game-1 loss was responsible for setting the tone early in the way Cleveland approached Game 2.

From filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.

“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).

Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SuBvO6eyCfM/sddefault.jpg,0.00990336361559842,0.0003414952970896007,29.0,0.0011850565276486805,0.01024485891268802,0.0114299154403367,2018-02-26,16:59:54,Monday,0,7,37,7,36,35,320,1,68,3,0,3,0,1,1,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.365494356659416,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Traditionally, Note series have not been discounted during Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend but this year, you may just be able to save around $170 or 20% OFF its $950 retail prices.  I also point out differences between U.S./Qualcomm unlocked model vs. international/Exynos unlocked model.

If you do find a better price on unlocked models, do let me know in the comment box below but I think these are the absolute-bottom and the best prices you will find on the Galaxy Note 8 during this Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend.  Happy shopping!

But the club media caught up with him away from the limelight of media attention and adoring fans at his official presentation to get an idea of the personal side of the Brazilian starlet.

His taste in music, his favourite food, his fashion sense, his childhood heroes and his strong religious views are among the subjects touched upon.

We even got him to sing a little, say his first words in Catalan and explain the meaning of his tattoos!

Click on the video above to see the full interview with Coutinho in the back seat of a splendid Audi vehicle.
----
Philippe Coutinho ya ha cumplido uno de sus sueños futbolísticos: ser jugador del FC Barcelona. Lo comentó en su presentación oficial, ante los medios de comunicación, pero también lo ha dejado claro en pequeño comité. Porque el brasileño se ha abierto con los medios del Club y, en una conversación exclusiva, ha hablado sobre él, sus aficiones y su forma de ser. También sobre su deseo futbolístico, que no es otro que el de ""ser campeón y ganar títulos"" de azulgrana. 

Lo dice un chico de 25 años tranquilo y familiar que, como se puede ver, siempre tiene una sonrisa en la boca: ""Sonreír es muy importante en la vida. Intento estar alegre cerca de las personas que quiero"", dijo, además de añadir:"" Dentro de campo intento siempre dar lo mejor de mí. En cada jugada, o en cada oportunidad que tengo, intento dar lo mejor para ayudar al equipo a ganar. Me gusta jugar con alegría"".

Con su fichaje por el Barça, Coutinho vuelve a Barcelona. Ya vivió aquí durante medio año, el año 2012, cuando estaba cedido en el Espanyol. ""La ciudad es muy buena. Cuando estuvimos aquí, nos gustó mucho"". Una experiencia de la que, además del recuerdo, se llevó algo muy especial: ""Tengo dos perros, y uno es de Barcelona. Ahora él también vuelve a casa"".

Apasionado de los tatuajes
Durante su revisión médica ya quedó claro que a Coutinho le gustan los tatuajes. Tiene unos cuantos y ha querido explicarnos cuáles son sus preferidos: ""Empecé con el nombre de mis padres, pero también tengo uno de mi esposa y otro de mi hija, que representa mucho para mí. También me gusta mucho el que dice 'Nunca pares de soñar'. En uno de los más nuevos que tengo quise escribir Coraje, una palabra que representa que siempre tenemos que ser valientes"".
------
Philippe Coutinho cumpriu o seu sonho de ser jogador do Barça. Na sua chegada a Barcelona, o craque brasileiro ofereceu uma entrevista diferente, dentro do carro, a caminho do Camp Nou. Nessa exclusiva, o novo reforço culé falou sobre os seus gostos pessoais, seu jeito de ser, sua paixão pelas tatuagens e o que espera como jogador do Barça. Imperdível!

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

Tom Clancy's The Division is an online-only open world third-person shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Massive and published by Ubisoft, with assistance from Red Storm Entertainment, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was announced during Ubisoft's E3 2013 press conference, and was released worldwide on 8 March 2016.

The Division is set in a near future New York City in the aftermath of a smallpox pandemic; the player, who is an agent of the eponymous Strategic Homeland Division, commonly referred to as simply ""The Division"", is tasked with helping the group rebuild its operations in Manhattan, investigate the nature of the outbreak, and combating criminal activity in its wake. The Division is structured with elements of role-playing games, as well as collaborative and player versus player online multiplayer.

The game received positive reviews, and was a commercial success, with Ubisoft stating that the game broke the company's record for highest number of first-day sales. Furthermore, one week after the game's release, Ubisoft stated that The Division was the company's best-selling game, and the industry's biggest first-week launch for a new game franchise, which generated an estimated amount of $330 million globally.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sz3vre0dVtw/sddefault.jpg,0.010555072643735256,0.0015588217421286107,6.771186440677966,0.003284093941467565,0.012113894385863863,0.015397988327331429,2017-12-03,16:45:41,Sunday,6,12,73,12,36,63,534,4,78,2,0,8,0,5,3,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.659328641891206,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'car': 2, 'person': 1}",3

Dans la foulée, le locataire de la Maison-Blanche a mentionné une ""solution à deux Etats"" comme issue possible du conflit, sans toutefois préciser ses projets. Mais pourquoi une telle décision côté américain ? A quoi joue Donald Trump ? Et pourquoi est-ce si dangereux ?Avec cette déclaration, le président des Etats-Unis qui aime dire qu’il tient ses promesses, donne satisfaction à deux pans de son électorat : les groupes de pression pro-israéliens puissants à Washington et aux évangéliques conservateurs pour qui la question de Jérusalem est centrale. Mais en agissant ainsi Donald Trump prend le contre-pied de presque sept décennies de politique américaine dans la région et va à l’encontre des résolutions du Conseil de sécurité.Donald Trump a assuré, mercredi, que les Etats-Unis restaient ""déterminés à aider à faciliter un accord de paix acceptable pour les deux parties"" mais sa décision de reconnaître unilatéralement Jérusalem comme capitale de l’Etat hébreu a retenti comme un coup de tonnerre. Si le Premier ministre israélien a applaudi, parlant d’un jour historique, dans toute la région c’est un concert de critiques, de réprobations et même de menaces. La Jordanie, pays gardien des lieux saints musulmans à Jérusalem, a dénoncé ""une violation du droit international et de la charte des Nations unies"". L’Arabie Saoudite a regretté une décision ""injustifiée et irresponsable"". Pour l’Iran, c’est une ""nouvelle intifada"" qui est inévitable.  Le Fatah d’Abbas a appelé ""à trois jours de colère"" et les islamistes du Hamas ont estimé qu’elle ouvrait ""les portes de l'enfer"" avant de lancer un nouveau soulèvement populaire palestinien à partir de vendredi.A quoi faut-il s’attendre ? Qu'est-ce qu'une intifada ? Les États-Unis peuvent-ils encore jouer le rôle de médiateur des négociations entre Israéliens et Palestiniens ? Y a-t-il un risque d'embrasement régional ?

Directed by: Haifaa Al-Mansour 
Starring: Elle Fanning, Maisie Williams, Bel Powley, Douglas Booth, Joanne Froggatt & Stephen Dillane 

She will forever be remembered as the writer who gave the world Frankenstein. But the real life story of Mary Shelley—and the creation of her immortal monster—is nearly as fantastical as her fiction. Raised by a renowned philosopher father (Stephen Dillane) in 18th-century London, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (Elle Fanning) is a teenage dreamer determined to make her mark on the world when she meets the dashing and brilliant poet Percy Shelley (Douglas Booth). So begins a torrid, bohemian love affair marked by both passion and personal tragedy that will transform Mary and fuel the writing of her Gothic masterwork. Imbued with the imaginative spirit of its heroine, Mary Shelley brings to life the world of a trailblazing woman who defied convention and channeled her innermost demons into a legend for the ages.

It’s an idea promoted by former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick called “principled confrontation.” Euwyn Poon, cofounder of electric scooter company Spin, refers to it as “innovating on the regulatory side.”

City officials called it something else: “illegal business activities.”

In Santa Monica in September, Bird put scooters on the streets, allowing customers to unlock them with a proprietary rideshare app.

Santa Monica responded by filing criminal charges against the company, which were ultimately dismissed when the company pleaded no contest and agreed to pay $300,000 in fines.

In San Francisco this month, the electric scooter companies, first LimeBike and Spin, then Bird, again distributed scooters across the city, and all three companies have argued neither city had rules in place to regulate their particular mode of transportation.

The companies see it as an emissions-free solution to the “last mile” often walked on foot or taken on a rideshare after using public transit.

Residents complain that riders take the scooters on sidewalks and leave them parked across sidewalks, blocking ADA ramps and tripping unsuspecting pedestrians.

Since their rollout, the companies have been negotiating with Santa Monica and San Francisco on how scooters should be regulated, and how the companies can get their riders to follow the rules.

T3BT-cnHjik,i-LCORFB860,What Happens When You're Struck By Lightning? | The Human Body,Tech Insider,28.0,2018-05-06 14:00:02+00:00,"['Tech Insider', 'TI', 'Tech', 'Science', 'Innovation', 'Digital culture', 'lightning', 'how to survive', 'lightning strike', 'thunderstorm', 'forest fire', 'electricity', 'lichtenberg figures']",1889712.0,19394.0,801.0,1968.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3BT-cnHjik/default.jpg,"Getting stuck by lightning is rough. It can burn hotter than the sun, scar your body, and even blow off your clothes. Even worse, it kills about 47 Americans per year. Although 90% of those struck survive, it's still worth knowing how to avoid getting a heavy dose of sky electricity.

Following is the transcript of the video:

Contrary to popular belief, lightning strikes aren’t always a death sentence. In fact, about 90 percent of people in the US who are struck actually survive.

Still, victims rarely walk away unscathed, and the damage can be permanent.

Lightning triggers 75,000 forest fires in the US each year and can split entire trees down the middle in a split second.

So it’s frightening to imagine what it does inside a human body.

The good news is that you won’t get cooked Wile E Coyote-style, but it can still do damage.

For starters, lightning carries between 1 to 10 billion joules of energy — enough to power a 100-watt bulb for at least 3 months. When that amount of electricity enters your body,  it short-circuits the small electrical signals that run your heart, lungs, and nervous system.

This can lead to cardiac arrest, seizures, brain injury, spinal cord damage, and even amnesia.

But electricity isn’t your only problem. Lightning is blisteringly hot. In under a second, it can heat the surrounding air to temperatures 5X hotter than the sun’s surface.

This causes a rapid expansion of air, which leads to a shock wave that we hear as thunder.

It has been calculated that someone standing within 30 feet of a lightning strike point can experience a blast wave equivalent to a 5kg TNT bomb (Blumenthal).

The intense heat, light, and electricity can also damage your eyes. In fact, it can bore holes in your retina and can cause cataracts within days or weeks.

Other side-effects of lightning can include impotence in men and overall decreased libido. That’s just what happens on the inside!

As the lightning moves toward the surface, it can force red blood cells out of your capillaries, into your epidermis….like a bruise. These intricate designs are called Lichtenberg figures.

The intense temperatures can also heat up any metal you might be wearing, causing third-degree burns and can also rapidly vaporize the rainwater or sweat on your skin. The resulting steam explosion may blow off your clothes and shoes leaving you nearly naked!

On average 47 people in the US are killed by lightning each year. So, you might be wondering, “How do I make sure I’m not that guy?”

For starters, check weather forecasts ahead of time, and stay indoors during a storm. But if you’re stuck outside, avoid isolated trees, poles, and open fields, and run as fast as you can towards safety.

You’re best off in a developed building or a hard-topped metal vehicle. So stay calm and just remember: “When thunder roars go indoors!”

유엔군 사령부가 판문점 귀순 과정에 대한 조사 결과를 발표하고 관련 영상을 공개했습니다.

북한군 추격조가 군사 분계선을 넘는 장면과 우리 군이 총상을 입고 쓰러진 귀순자를 끌어내는 장면이 상세하게 담겼습니다.

취재기자 연결합니다. 강정규 기자!

그동안 판문점 귀순 과정을 놓고 여러 가지 의혹이 많았는데, 이제 어느 정도 해소가 되겠군요?

[기자]
드디어 판도라의 상자가 열렸습니다.

영상은 북한 귀순자가 탄 차량이 전조등으르 켠채 빠른 속도로 판문점에 접근하는 장면부터 시작합니다.

인근 초소를 그냥 지나치자, 북한 초병이 황급히 차를 뒤따라 나가고, 판문각과 인근 초소에서 소총을 든 북한 군인들이 우르르 뛰쳐 나옵니다.

차량이 배수구에 빠져 멈춰서자 귀순자는 차에서 내려 달리기 시작합니다.

이후 북한 병사들은 귀순자를 향해 무차별 사격을 가하는 긴박한 장면들이 모두 담겼습니다.

특히 북한 추격조 1명이 군사 분계선을 넘는 모습도 포착이 됐는데요.

판문각과 자유의 집 사이엔 파란색 지붕의 군사정전위 회담장 건물 3채가 있고, 서편 끝에 흰색 건물이 중립국위원회 회의장 인데요.

총격이 이뤄진 곳은 바로 중립국위원회 회의장 바로 옆이었습니다.

이 건물 한가운데로 군사 분계선이 지나고 있는데, 북한 병사가 이 건물이 끝나는 지점까지 달려 나왔다가 멈칫하고 되돌아 가는 장면이 찍힌 겁니다.

유엔군 사령부는 북한 추격조가 군사분계선 넘어서 남쪽으로 총격을 가하고 그 중에 한명이 군사 분계선까지 넘었다며 이는 명백한 정정협정 위반이라고 지적했습니다.

[앵커]
추가로 열감시장비 TOD 영상도 공개됐죠?

[기자]
귀순자는 북한군 총격을 피해 우리측 자유의 집 주차장에 있는 얕은 벽 뒤로 몸을 숨겼습니다.

이곳은 판문점 CCTV의 사각지대여서 열 감시장비 TOD 영상에 잡혔는데요.

영상을 보면 우리 측 JSA 요원 2명이 낮은 포복으로 접근해 직접 안전지대로 끌어내는 장면이 담겼습니다.

귀순자로부터 약 10미터 정도 떨어진 지점에 나머지 한명이 웅크리고 있는 듯한 모습도 보이는데요.

당초 우리 군은 JSA 경비대대장 등 간부 3명이 낮은 포복으로 귀순자를 끌어냈다고 밝혔지만 영상을 보면 낮은 포복으로 접근해 귀순자를 끌어낸 것은 2명이고 나머지 한 명은 뒤에서 엄호한 것으로 파악됩니다.

Bak Kut Teh is a meat stew that is boiled for hours with herbs until it becomes tender, off-the-bone succulent. Though it may be a heavy breakfast choice for some, I thought it was a great start to our food day.

The Chili Pan Mee (dry noodles) with a fried egg, anchovies, and chilis were amazing. The noodles were al dente, chewy, and the perfect snack to add to any food itinerary! 

Even now as I'm writing this description, the thought of those crabs just makes me drool! At first, I thought the black crab was cooked in black bean paste, but that wasn't the case. It is covered in a dense, shrimp paste and is incredibly flavorful. The chili crab and the salted egg crabs were equally amazing in flavor, and if you dip some bread in the sauce, perfection!

Kylie Jenner has yet to officially confirm if she’s pregnant, but her bestfriend Jordyn Woods isn’t doing anything to stop the speculation. 

Kylie Jenner might not even have to confirm her pregnancy at this point, because her friends and family are basically doing it for her. 

Kylie’s BFF Jordyn Woods attended BeautyCon London earlier this week and was asked about the Lip Kit creator’s potential big news. While the model didn’t explicitly say Kylie is expecting rapper Travis Scott’s baby, she did reveal that she’d be an amazing mother. Jordyn explained QUOTE “I think everyone I'm friends with will make great parents. We all have each other so it's great.”  

Kylie is reportedly due to have a baby girl in February, so she’s pretty far along in her pregnancy at this point. That being said, the interviewer also asked Jordyn how her bestie is doing right now, to which she replied QUOTE ""Kylie's doing great, she's like my best friend so I see her a lot. I honestly can't speak on anyone else’s situation except my own, but she's doing really well.”

There have been tons of hints dropped by Kylie’s friends and family members over the past couple months, including Kris Jenner’s refusal to confirm or deny that both her youngest daughter and Khloe Kardashian are pregnant. 

Kim Kardashian was also asked about her sisters’ potential big news while on The Late Late Show With James Corden, and she literally drank a sardine smoothie instead of having to answer the question.

A recent theory suggests that Khloe and Kylie will FINALLY reveal their pregnancies in the annual Kardashian-Jenner family Christmas card, so if this is true, we might know the truth before December is over. 

We know we ask you this all the time, but we have to know -- do you think Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian are actually pregnant, or is all this speculation some sort of elaborate plot to get people talking. Sound off in the comments below. I’m your host Drew Dorsey, thanks so much for watching Clevver and I’ll see you next time. 

And then click to the left to get more details about the KarJenners possibly making pregnancy reveals in their Christmas card. Thanks again to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring today’s episode. Xfinity Mobile is a new kind of network designed to save you money.

[ LONG:D ]

Sentimental duo Long:D, who are receiving much attention in the indie music industry with their unique voices met Kim Doyeon, who left a strong impression in Produce 101 last year and made a successful debut as Weki Meki this summer. ‘All Right’ is a pre-release song from the second mini album of Long:D. Han Min Se of Long:D, who worked with many female singers including Yunha, Juniel and Park Hye Kyoung, made this song by keeping in mind Kim Doyeon from the first place.

안녕하세요 오늘은 큐브라떼를 준비했어요 
그냥 커피를 얼려 우유와 함께 마시면 되는데요 얼음이 들어가지 않는 아이스커피라서 녹을수록 진해지는 커피입니다 저는 큰 큐브 사이즈로 만들었어요 
좋아하는 실리콘몰드 , 그리고 좋아하는 커피를 냉동실에 얼려요
콜드브루, 에스프레소, 드립, 모카포트 등등! 
좋아하는 아이스크림, 시럽등 뭐든 곁들여보세요 :_)

★ 저는 모카포트로 커피를 추출했는데요 좋아하는 커피로 만들어보세요
★ 모카포트의 사용법은 인터넷에 검색하면 자세히 나옵니다 간단하게 설명드리자면
제일 아랫부분에 물을 채우고, 그 위에 원두를 평평하게 담아줍니다 (누르면 안됨)
그리고 추출이 되는 제일 윗부분을 꽉 잠군다음 약불에 올려 추출이 되면 불을끕니다
(손잡이가 타지않도록 주의!, 물을 채우는 양은 물 받는 곳에 표시가 있음)
원두 분쇄도는 에스프레소 보다는 두껍게, 드립 보다는 가늘게 갈아줍니다 
★ 제가 사용한 실리콘 몰드는 가로 세로 5cm 몰드입니다 (실리코마트 제품)
모카포트 3컵 정도 필요한 것 같아요

Starting with the big bang and culminating in the appearance of homo sapiens, this experience follows the unfolding of time at 22 million years per second, adhering closely to current scientific understanding.

It can be difficult to fathom how long 13.8 billion years is. The more you watch this video, the more it sinks in just how stunningly old the universe is, and how magnificently tiny we humans are in the grand scheme. I hope seeing this experiment in humility makes you ponder the vast, unwitnessed ages that have passed before we came along, and the brevity of our existence in comparison.  

Every event featured in this video is fascinating on its own, so I highly encourage anybody interested to dig deeper. Start with the Wikipedia page on geologic time and go from there to learn more about all the events featured within. 

Peace and love,

The Rylo records spherical video just like any other 360 cam. Users are free to share the full spherical video if they like, but the Rylo’s secret is its ability to allow you to “direct” the camera from within its mobile app (currently limited to iOS, with an Android version coming in early 2018) to output perfect fixed-frame videos. Reframe, set automatic pans, and track objects — all with liquid smooth stabilization — after the shot is made.

In essence, the Rylo is a true set-it-and-forget-it camera, capturing everything around it and giving you the freedom to make creative decisions later. Sure, this is technically possible with any 360 cam and the right editing software, but never has it been so user friendly and approachable — and never have the results looked so good with so little input required.

So, is this $500 little camera worth the buy?

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday and Sunday!

A semantics based approach

Do you want to learn how modern binary code obfuscation and deobfuscation works? Did you ever encounter road-blocks where well-known deobfuscation techniques do not work? Do you want to see a novel deobfuscation method that learns the code's behavior without analyzing the code itself? Then come to our talk and we give you a step-by-step guide.

This talk might be interesting for you if you love reverse engineering or binary security analysis. We present you modern code obfuscation techniques, such as opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding and virtualization-based obfuscation. Further, we explain state-of-the-art methods in (automated) deobfuscation [1] as well as how to break these [2]. Finally, we introduce a novel  approach [3] that learns the code's semantics and demonstrate how this can be used to deobfuscate real-world obfuscated code.

Big Thanks to Frontier for flying me out to LA to play Jurassic World Evolution for the first time, getting to meet and interview Jeff Goldblum who's reprising his roll as Dr. Ian Malcolm from the original Jurassic Park, getting to see friends and hang out with Bo and Ed who are the best community managers ever.  I'd agree and give the game 10 out of 10 Goldblums...a high honor. 

In my playthrough there were 4 dinosaurs to incubate and hatch including the Triceratops, Ceratosaurus, Edmontosaurus and Struthiomimus.  You could work with the 3 branches; Security, Entertainment and Science and I opted for Security....cause dinosaur raptor army...am I right?  

Jurassic World Evolution Release Date:  June 12

About Jurassic World Evolution: 
Jurassic World Evolution puts players in charge of cinema’s greatest tourist destination – where they will have the opportunity to construct and manage their own Jurassic World.

“As long-time fans of the entire Jurassic series we’re thrilled to be putting players in charge of their own Jurassic World,” said Frontier’s Chief Creative Officer, Jonny Watts. “We’re excited to bring over fifteen years of management, simulation, and creature development expertise to a destination and franchise that remains an inspiration to us.”

Jurassic World Evolution evolves players’ relationship with the Jurassic World film franchise, placing them in control of operations on the legendary island of Isla Nublar and the surrounding islands of the Muertes Archipelago. Players will build their own Jurassic World as they bioengineer new dinosaur breeds and construct attractions, containment and research facilities.

Thank you for watching!

We go beyond the profile, with each new episode being a candid look into the everyday lives of our subjects – meeting their friends and observing their rise to Internet prominence.

For our first installment, we take a look at the man behind the handle RAYSCORRUPTEDMIND. Most notable for his exclusive portraits and behind-the-scenes snaps of rappers like Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, Quavo and Lil Yachty, the budding photographer has established an intimate style which has helped him amass an immense following on Instagram. His distinct body of work has led to large corporations like Nike looking to emulated his style.

In the featured video, we take a look into Ray's life – much of which he spends hanging out in Manhattan with his close friends Imran and Osiris. The young creative tells us about how shooting at home with Bloody Osiris led him to eventually become Travis Scott's personal photographer. During our time, Ray reveals his secret to capturing genuine moments with the most elusive artists, and provides valuable advice for other aspiring photographers.

Stay tuned for the next episode of HYPEBEAST IRL.
