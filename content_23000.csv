Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TIrAQ8t_8tg/sddefault.jpg,0.018790084665081242,0.0001292895733835865,145.33333333333334,0.0005210761593944545,0.018919374238464823,0.01944045039785928,2018-03-14,08:35:00,Wednesday,2,9,37,8,32,61,329,6,76,0,1,8,16,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.069126910536686,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

SUMMARY
-Some of the important aspects of Harry's appearance from the books weren't reflected in the film. According to the books, “the boy who lived” has his mother’s green eyes and the wild hair that refuses to be styled.
-The author chose a thick bush of chestnut hair and large front teeth (which she reduced in Goblet of Fire, though, when Malfoy’s spell ricocheted into Hermione) to be Hermione’s distinguishing features. Emma Watson had this “thick bush” only in the first movie and nice teeth from the very beginning.
-In the books, Ron has a long nose and freckles that are nowhere to be found on Rupert Grint.
-Severus' description in the book says he had “greasy black hair and a hooked nose.” Plus, he was supposed to be just a little older than thirty at the beginning of the first book.
-None of the actors who played Dumbledore had his “very long and crooked” nose.
-When ""Mad-Eye"" appears in the book, he is described as a man with a badly disfigured face and tip of the nose. In the movie, however, he looks just fine apart from the famous “mad eye” and several lines on his face.
-According to J.K. Rowling's vision, Viktor Krum was tall, slim, and had a hooked nose. Some of these details made it to the film, but most of them, unfortunately, didn't.
-In the books, Mrs. Dursley is described as having a long neck that granted her the ability to spy on her neighbors, which she just loved to do, and blonde hair.
-In the books, Minerva is described to be a tall, black-haired and kind of severe-looking woman, who, according to Harry's first impression, “is not someone to cross.”
-Acoording to J.K. Rowling, Dolores Umbridge looks just as unpleasant on the outside as she truly is inside. She certainly has some resemblance to a frog thanks to her round, bulging eyes, large mouth, and pale, loose skin.
-In the book, Rufus Scrimgeour resembled an old lion because of his ""mane"" of graying ginger hair and his style of clothing.
-When we first meet him in the books, Bill Weasley is described to be tall, thin and handsome. He looks like a rock star and usually wears his hair in a ponytail.
-In the books, aristocratic Narcissa Malfoy is tall and very pale. According to Harry, she looks like “she's got dung under her nose.”

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

i should've seen this through
but i knew how it could end
i guess things don't change
i let feelings fade again

and i won't let go
what i called home unless
you slip right through my fingers in the rain
but i've thrown it all
over waterfalls

i'm staring at the clouds
you know i hate this weather
but we can work it out
i swear i could do better
if you let me
so we wait for things to change
i never thought that this could end
if i'm not with you
how could i fall asleep again

what's wrong with the lights low
just tell me what it is you're tryna say
cause in the end you'll understand
i'm already a world away
and I see you haven't changed

cause this shit gets old
with a heart of gold, you know
if i need you, i'll see you in my dreams
but I've thrown it all
over waterfalls

i'm staring at the clouds
you know i hate this weather
but we can work it out
i swear i could do better
if you let me
so we wait for things to change
i never thought that this could end
if i'm not with you
how could I fall asleep again?

you know that i've been here times before
and no one's watching
you won't ever know, that's right

Lyrics
(Intro)
I keep flipping, back and forth
I keep flipping, back and forth

(Hook 1)
I keep flipping back and forth like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
I keep flipping back and forth like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse

(Verse 1)
Back to back flights got my eyes red as fuck,
LA to WA, land in Ireland for luck,
Touchdown in Norway for snowdays with Chubbs,
Shoutout to Gang Gang cause they know what's up,

In hawaii right now,
Writing this song, 
While I'm smoking the loud,
Even if dark won't slow down,
Living my life, I'm a king with a crown.

(Hook 2)
I keep flipping back and forth like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
I keep flipping back and forth like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse

(Verse 2)
Traveling, 
Singing,
I'm living my dreams and,
It only gets better with time I'm investing,
Hate while you can cause my name you'll be blasting,
Out the next Uber you hop in no option,
Constant heat,
I'll keep dropping,
My expectations,
They keep rising,
Force myself,
To keep improving, 
Reward myself, 
With Travel Tokens

I keep flipping
Back and forth
I keep flipping
Back and forth baby

(Hook 3)
I keep flipping back and forth like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
I keep flipping back and forth like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse
Like a lighthouse",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TN5_w0C6Nbc/sddefault.jpg,0.03182857890326983,0.0012090829706673644,26.324561403508767,0.009089334261946766,0.03303766187393719,0.04212699613588397,2018-05-26,23:00:01,Saturday,5,4,57,4,44,39,509,4,113,3,2,0,16,0,0,9.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.692177893714107,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

This adorable doggy must have been on Santa’s nice list this year, after being surprised with an equally adorable furry pup companion.

12-year-old golden retriever Cash has been a little lonely over the past few years, after owner Marie Ahonen’s other dog, Rosie, died suddenly three years ago.

But the family’s sudden loss didn’t stop Cash FROM being the good boy he's always been - so Marie decided to reward his good behavior with a special surprise from Santa.

Number 7:
BMW Letron
Turkish company 'Letvision', has been quietly assembling real-life Transformers out of BMWs. Except they don’t call them Transformers – they call them Letrons. 12 of Letvision’s engineers have been building a fully-working prototype, which they call ANTIMON. Letvision has plans to create a whole line of the robots, which will transform out of various models of BMW cars.

Number 6:
The Hum Rider By Verizon
The Hum Rider is an SUV fitted with custom hydraulics elevating it five feet in the air, offering enough clearance for it to rise above cars and cut through traffic. The driver can raise vehicle’s body above traffic by pressing a switch on the dashboard. Truly, the Hum Rider is the 'Optimus Prime of the automotive world.

Number 5:
Robokia By KIA Motors:
The car put under test was Kia’s SUV, Borrego. KIA Motors dubbed the transforming SUV as ROBOKIA. The company showcased the same at São Paulo International Motor Show.

Number 3:
EO Smart Connecting Car by DFKI - Bremen:
Created by DFKI Robotics Innovation Center, the EO Smart Connecting Car 2 adapts to the urban environment like a rat squeezing through cracks in a boarded-up building. It can shrink to take up less space, and even drive sideways into parking spaces. The pod-like design features seating for two and four electric motors, one mounted to each wheel hub. This design allowed engineers to give the car some serious turning ability. Each wheel can rotate 90 degrees. The EO Smart Connecting Car 2 isn’t destined for production, but it demonstrates possible ways to make cars easier to use in cities.

Andy's dad is an alcoholic and he feels safer sleeping outside than at home with family. 

When I first saw Andy is was sleeping. As a rule, I never wake anyone up. Andy shares about how he has been walking around at night and desperate for sleep. Sleep deprivation is common for homeless people sleeping rough. A good nights sleep is rare. 

Although Andy shares about rough sleeping in the United Kingdom, the challenges of living on the streets homelessness are the same in the United States and Canada. People don't just walk by, they spit on you and call you names. People even with good intentions give an overabundance of food yet refuse to help with money or other basics needs besides Mcdonalds or Burger King meals. 

Here's a post I wrote about panhandling and people begging for money: “Giving Money to Homeless People Is Okay https://byrslf.co/giving-money-to-homeless-people-is-okay-41361adfe2fa

Andy's story is powerful. He's only 21 years old and he's experiencing more pain and suffering than any young adult should. Sadly, Andy's story is far too common among homeless young adults. Instead of giving a sandwich we all must work together to end homelessness. 

Thanks to all of your support, we got Andy inside tonight. He found me a little while after this interview with all of the change he had made from panhandling in his hand and said ""I am going to give this to a charity box."" Just by helping him get inside tonight it changed everything.

About Invisible People: 

Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they’re on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can’t ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation’s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TRRbCzZH_HY/sddefault.jpg,0.02409258217055768,0.00047610730527146525,50.60326086956522,0.008210263476230214,0.024568689475829145,0.032778952952059355,2018-06-12,20:25:35,Tuesday,1,12,64,12,46,76,555,2,100,0,0,11,0,2,5,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.758462855997043,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSXhHn4wrbE/sddefault.jpg,0.012910752977678628,0.000256420118722515,50.35,0.00041027218995602405,0.013167173096401143,0.013577445286357171,2018-02-09,06:08:38,Friday,4,9,38,8,33,52,334,2,79,0,1,6,14,4,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.682334885180607,3,"['neutral', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 5}",6

Reaching up to 7 feet in length, these guys are the largest of the four anteater species. Without teeth, anteaters use their long tongues to catch and consume their prey. Their tongues can flick up to 150 times a minute, giving them the ability to gobble thousands of insects a day. Sadly, overhunting and habitat loss have left the species vulnerable.

From a small town in Texas to big-time show business comes ""Behind the Curtain,"" an inspiring documentary of grit, perseverance and the redemptive power of art. Viewers watch him struggle to write songs about growing up gay and black in small-town Texas, his difficult relationship with his mom and the harsh realities of trying to make it in show business. With limited time and budget, the odds are against him, but Hall's passion and his team of talented performers overcome all obstacles to bring this story to the world.

[Intro Coro, Justin Quiles]
Sigue mencionando mi nombre
Quiere que en su barrio me asome
Tranquila que no es pa' pelear
Esto es pa' toa la noche guallar
Y cuando prendo
Pierdo los sentidos
Dice que soy yo
El que mantiene vivo
Ese deseo que siente por dentro
La hago romper con todos sus juramentos

[Coro]
Juraste nunca estar conmigo y eso se rompió
Tu muy bien sabes quien fue el que te dio
El que en tu cuerpo la llama prendió
Ya se rumoro
Juraste nunca estar conmigo y eso se rompió
Tu muy bien sabes quien fue el que te dio
El que en tu cuerpo la llama prendió
Ya se rumoro

[Farruko]
Ay no te hagas mami
si ya se yo quien tu eres
te me quedas mirando
cuando paso en el Mercedes
no se porque te cohíbes
si yo se quién tu quieres
que te gualle hace rato
mami que loco me tienes
mami no seas tímida
dale pégate y baila
te voy a mandar el location
pa' que a casa tu le caigas
que tengo una sed de pure
pa'que prendamos
y conmigo viajes

[Justin Quiles]
Ya se rumoro
hicimos de too
no fui yo dime si a usted su amiga le contó
y la boca abrió
se que le gusto
porque cuando terminamos su amiga llamo
que quiere información de nosotros
muy rara la noto
será que se quiere combinar con nosotros
será que planean tranquilas
bajo el efecto del tequila

[Coro]
Juraste nunca estar conmigo y eso se rompió
Tu muy bien sabes quien fue el que te dio
El que en tu cuerpo la llama prendió
Ya se rumoro
Juraste nunca estar conmigo y eso se rompió
Tu muy bien sabes quien fue el que te dio
El que en tu cuerpo la llama prendió
Ya se rumoro

[Nengo Flow]
Dímelo coqueta dura te prometiste
Esas promesas duran
Hasta que te desvestiste
Vamos a hacerlo fumando
No hay tiempo pa' que estés triste
Tu fronteaste bebe pero mira donde caíste
Ella es mi amante mi cómplice
Mai'conmigo quédese
Y no este jurando de mentiras
Se que vas a oír que la mala me tiran
Pero quiere caliente mi cama te activa
Voy a matarte mami sin preguntarte
Voy a estrujarte baby hasta detonarte
Mucho mucho Flow
Tu sabes que mi estilo parte
Mai' tu quieres avena y yo soy quien la reparte

We decided to go for the Sherbourne range in a Stone Grey finish with Lattice handles combined with mirrored doors.
 
The buttoned seat pad in Pastiche Slub Chalk fabric and the interiors were a mixture of shelving, long hanging, double hanging and single hanging.

We would not recommend Sharps enough, they were truly fabulous from start to finish and the whole process in total took around 3 weeks with the building of the walk in wardrobe only taking 3 days! 

If you are thinking about doing the same thing and love what we chose you can find more info at Sharps.co.uk - http://bit.ly/2pAqHwc

Interesting facts about the marriage of president Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump


#16. Who is Melania Trump- Donald Trump’s third wife, Melania, is the first and only lady to be born in and from a communist country. She was raised in a tower block in Yugoslavia, which makes her the first lady to be born outside of the United States. She started modeling at just five years old. She was later signed to a top modeling agency in Milan, Italy, when she turned eighteen. As a teenager she studied design and architecture at the University of Ljubljana. At that time she was traveling to Milan for work where she was signed on to a talent agency. While Melania was in Italy, she was on the path to meet her billionaire husband. In 1996 she moved to New York on a work visa, and has appeared on Magazine covers such as New York Magazine, Harper’s Bazaar in Bulgaria, Vogue in Italy, and GQ in the United Kingdom. In 1998 she started dating Donald Trump, then the two of them got married in 2005, she gave birth to their son, Barron, a year later. Melania stayed in New York with Barron until he finished the school year then they both moved to Washington to join Donald in June 2017. Her nickname for Donald is “Little Donald” because he loves wearing a suit and tie so much. Other than being viewed as a trophy wife, people say she is a crucial part of Team Trump and the most powerful woman in the world. Melania is forty seven years old and speaks five languages: English, German, Serbian, French, and Slovene. She’s also 5ft 11 inches, which makes her one of the tallest first ladies in history.



#15. When did Donald and Melania get married- When the two first met Donald was fifty-two years old, they met at a party at the Kit Kat Club during New York Fashion Week in 1998. At first, the supermodel was turned off by the billionaire. Melania told the New York Times when she met him she told her friends, “He’s here with a woman. I am absolutely not giving him my number.” So instead Donald ended up giving her all his numbers, home, and business, and she gave him a call when she got back from a modeling trip. After his second marriage collapsed to Marla Maples, the two started dating. They got married in 2005 and had lots of famous faces at the wedding. Bill and Hillary Clinton attended as well. Melania’s wedding dress cost $100,000 and took five hundred and fifty hours to make.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TYMseFrbVBc/sddefault.jpg,0.008883544255473478,0.0022491090005262826,3.9498060135790496,0.0009614886440174193,0.011132653255999759,0.01209414190001718,2018-02-09,20:14:28,Friday,4,6,43,6,29,39,352,1,67,0,0,5,1,2,3,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.734702969300287,2,"['neutral', 'sad']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,{'person': 2},2

The channel where we build crazy cars and contraptions. This is a raw time lapse with no commentary. In this time lapse, we start with a used home made go kart we found on facebook market place for $250. We stripped it of everything we didn't need including the engine, then shortened the chassis to fit our barbie car (Pink Power Wheels Mustang). Next, we stripped down a Honda CRF 230 dirt bike. We used the engine and wire harness for our front engined go kart build.

We built this go kart to race the boostedboiz in their shopping kart - go kart. Hopefully they accept our challenge!

Oh! This look was totally experimental, and I'm so happy I ended up loving it, I honestly didn't know where I was going with it, but I wanted to create something with no pressure—just a dope look, see it laid back and just see where my chicken claws took me. Hope you guys enjoy the video!! Cheep cheep 🐓💋!

✎ She was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother. She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teens and became pregnant at 14. Sent to live with the man she calls her father, a barber in Tennessee, Winfrey landed a job in radio while still in high school. Her emotional ad-lib delivery eventually got her transferred to the daytime talk show arena. She's thought to have popularized and revolutionized the tabloid talk show genre pioneered by Phil Donahue. By the mid-1990s, she had reinvented her show with a focus on literature, self-improvement, and spirituality. From 2006 to 2008, her endorsement of Obama, by one estimate, delivered over a million votes. In 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. The viewership for The Oprah Winfrey Show was highest during the 1991–92 season when about 13.1 million U.S. viewers were watching each day. The power of Winfrey's opinions and endorsement to influence public opinion has been dubbed ""The Oprah Effect"".

Also going into the experience all of us included decided to keep it a chill and relaxed experience. I could have EASILY went in there, freaked out and made a fool of myself. It took a lot not to but at the end of the day, she's a person like all of us, she struggles with anxiety and overwhelming her was something we just didn't want to do. I'll never regret sharing this experience with you guys and I hope if you're unhappy with how mine went you can meet her in this setting one day and make yours even better. love you guys XOXO PAIGE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2016, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them revealed that Johnny Depp was going to play a new character in the Harry Potter universe, Gellert Grindelwald, along with Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law. Unfortunately, he had just been accused of domestic abuse against his wife, Amber Heard. Today, you’ll know everything about this as we talk about the controversy surrounding Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. 

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard got married in 2015 but divorced only one year after in 2016. This was when the actress got a temporary restraining order against Depp because she accused him of domestic violence. She had many proofs, including some pictures of what we did to her, some text messages that his assistant sent her, and a video of Johnny Depp being aggressive.

After an agreement, the couple officially divorced and Amber withdrew her restraining order. But director David Yates and screenwriter J.K. Rowling had to defend him when they decided that he was still going to be part of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. But just wait until you see what J.K. Rowling did when a fan asked her a question on Twitter! 

Stay tuned if you want to hear more about the controversy surrounding Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald including what David Yates and J.K. Rowling said in 2016 and how they replied to people who criticized their choice in 2017. Do you think that Johnny Depp should be part of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald or not? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below!

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League Club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's Internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the Internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live full length MLB game over the Internet when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time.

MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.

Armin van Buuren finally unleashes his new artist album ‘BALANCE’. As stated by Armin van Buuren, the album is about thinking in possibilities rather than definition, thinking about what music could be instead of what it should be. “Every song I make teaches me something new, and the next song is always a result of all my previous records, the new things I learned and the people I met”, the world-renowned DJ and producer says in the foreword of his album. “Over the years, this process - and especially the fun of creating - became more and more important to me. It’s a journey that gives me meaning and helps me learn more about my personal interests rather than focus on the recognition I get for the outcome. That’s the big difference between who I am today and who I was a few years ago. 'BALANCE' is a new chapter in my book of life, the result of venturing into known and unknown territories while finding the balance in between. This creative journey gives me the energy to do what I do, to keep going. I don’t want to think about what music should be. I want to think about what music could be.""

         Jeff, aka Mr. Pickles, an icon of children's television, a beacon of kindness and wisdom to America's impressionable young minds and the parents who grew up with him - who also anchors a multimillion-dollar branding empire.But when this beloved personality's family - wife, two sons, sister and father - begins to implode, Jeff finds no fairy tale or fable or puppet will guide him through the crisis, which advances faster than his means to cope. The result: a kind man in a cruel world faces a slow leak of sanity as hilarious as it is heartbreaking

Cases of corruption have come up against Benjamin Netanyahu, and some of his closest advisors and confidants.  Recently, police even recommended that Netanyahu be charged for his alleged involvement in two of the incidents. Even though Netanyahu has written these allegations off as a political “witch hunt” against him and “fake news” we want to explore what these cases are all about in the first place.

In this episode Judah is going to break down the four cases of alleged corruption against Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, or people close to him.

Despite whatever evidence is brought up, the decision whether the Netanyahu’s will be indicted on any of these cases lies in the hand of Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who was once a political appointee of Netanyahu’s.  Despite their history, the Attorney General says he would not hesitate to indict Netanyahu if necessary.

He quickly fell in love with a three-year-old pit bull named Merrill. When it was time to pick her up, the shelter ran into a bit of a problem. Merrill wouldn't leave her best friend behind.

The volunteers at Rocket Dog Rescue dedicate their time to save unwanted and abused dogs from overcrowded shelters. Their mission is to stop dogs from getting euthanized. They regularly rescue dogs that don't have the best luck getting adopted. In 2014, the rescue took in a sick pit bull and an older Chihuahua. The two pups wouldn't leave each other's side.

Merrill and her eight-year-old Chihuahua friend Taco were brought to Rocket Dog Rescue together. The volunteers knew nothing about the dog's owner, but they did know that the two dogs were best friends. They were together all the time, and if they ever got separated, they would cry. Soon enough, the shelter truly understood how deep their bond went.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

President Donald Trump’s limited strike on Syria in April is an established tactic among presidents — his predecessors from Obama through Reagan all used similar actions, with varying results.

But limited strikes that accomplish all their goals are exceedingly rare — only about 6 percent can make that claim, according to research by expert Micah Zenko. Most strikes have mixed success, at best. 

For example: Trump’s justification for attacking Syria was to send a message about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons. That’s the same justification he used when authorizing a limited strike on Syria one year earlier. 

Why do presidents even use limited strikes if they’re rarely effective? There is some logic to it. For one, they’re not very costly. But more importantly, these strikes generally don’t put US troops in harm's way. And well, politically, presidents have very little to lose by exercising the option. 

In fact, authorizing a limited strike can give the appearance of strength and decisiveness and can sometimes have a positive effect on approval, whether or not the strike actually achieves its intended goals.

At this market, you shop for seafood items like fresh fish, crabs, clams, mussels, lobsters and then take the seafood to a number of local restaurants located nearby so they can prepare it for you in a variety of ways.

We also happened to run into a few very friendly friends from Saudia Arabia and went with them to their hotel for a Salmon and Rice feast. After which we returned to the seafood market, selected some fish, crab, clams, and prawns. We then headed for a restaurant called Hong Kong Master Cook and begin one of the most delicious seafood feasts I've ever had!

The seafood was prepared in many different ways and my favorite was the fish cooked in spicy chili broth. Also, the crab was some of the most tender onesI've ever had. I would highly recommend this seafood market if ever in Manila Philipines.

what is fika ? another one of the scandinavian words and concepts that has just taken over the lifestyle blogs and youtube vids - just like lagom and hygge !
well, basically it's like the cosy swedish version of a coffee break. but more than that it a way to socialise with your co-workers, friends and family. we drink coffee, we eat some sandwiches or cinnamon rolls ( yum ) and we chitchat about the small things in life ( leave your political opinions at the door ! )

listen to our podcast - latest episode :
#METOO, OUR THOUGHTS !?
( http://bit.ly/2sOWDTF )

and all this takes place in the fikarum ( fika room ). an office is not an office without one. a lot of stuff goes on there, and if you're unlucky - there might be some embarrassing or uncomfortable situations, if your colleagues are not exactly PC... in the fika room, we should respect the cinnamon rolls enough to keep things civilised !

anyway, besides from explaining the concept, i'm also in this video sharing my 5 rules of fika !
learn them and try having a hygge fika moment in your own home or workplace.

On today's podcast, we'll grade his performance. While some believe 'The Eagle' looked vulnerable and will fare poorly against Conor McGregor or Tony Ferguson. Others, however, believe he was as dominant as ever. What's the truth? We'll look at both the numbers and the tape to get to the truth. This is the Monday Morning Analyst with Luke Thomas.

It was chewy but good! Then we took a look around the hotel lobby and around the hotel grounds. We even got a chance to look inside the wedding pavilion and bridal party suite (I'm not sure what it's actually called), it was really cool to see how they framed the window around Cinderella Castle. That would definitely make for a magical ceremony! Then we checked out the outside picture spots and beach area. We took a look at the DVC lobby and the main lobby restaurants and other food locations around the hotel. We showed as many menus as we could to give you guys an idea of the food selection and price.

안녕하세요 오늘은 리얼 메론 우유 만드는 방법을 준비했어요 
만드는 방법은 지난번 딸기 우유와 거의 같아요 딸기 우유보다 조금 덜 끓이는 정도?

맛에 대해서 얘기하자면 메로나 맛을 기대 하셨다면 만들지 않는 걸 추천드립니다
메로나 맛이 미미하게 나긴 하지만 그 맛은 아니에요 
첫맛은 오묘하고 두 번째 마시면 달달한 메론향 우유에요 (첫맛이 오묘합니다 진짜 오묘해요)
오묘 하다는 걸 어떻게 설명 해드리면 좋을까 싶었는데요 오묘하다는 말 밖에는..
근데 진짜 신기하게 첫맛만 꾸리꾸리 오묘하고 두 모금 부터는 달달한 맛이에요 
메론을 썰어 넣어서 씹는 맛도 좋습니다 메론 우유는 만들고 1일 이내로 다 드세요! 

▶재료 (500ml 1병 분량) 
메론 1/4통, 설탕 50g (소주컵 1컵), 자른 메론 적당히, 우유 200~300ml

1) 메론 1/4통을 잘라 믹서에 갈아줍니다 
2) 설탕과 같이 냄비에 담아 약불에 올려 3분 정도 끓여줍니다
3) 끓인 멜론은 식혀줍니다 (차게 식혀주세요)
4) 준비한 보틀에 끓여서 식힌 멜론과 작게 자른 멜론 조각, 우유를 부어 섞어줍니다
5) 만든 우유는 하루 이내로 다 드세요

What's more: I've never gotten over that experience. The skin-stretching acceleration; the futuristic features; the fact that it never needed a drop of gasoline – to a guy just starting a YouTube tech channel, Tesla's Model S and Model X were the ultimate manifestation of mobile technology, and the Model 3 promised much of the same experience in a more affordable package.

Flash-forward to 2018: that Tesla Model 3 is finally rolling off the production line … and I’ve just spent two days behind the wheel. Not enough time for a review, but enough to get a sense of how many promises it delivers on. Watch the MrMobile extended Tesla Model 3 test drive to see where it succeeds, where it falls flat ... and why it makes me want a Model S more than anything else.

Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Evan Rachel Wood, James Marsden, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright, Tessa Thompson, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Jimmi Simpson, Rodrigo Santoro, Shannon Woodward, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, Ben Barnes, Simon Quarterman, Angela Sarafyan, Luke Hemsworth And Clifton Collins, Jr. Star.
The one-hour drama series WESTWORLD kicks off its ten-episode season SUNDAY, OCT. 2 at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT), exclusively on HBO. Created for television by Jonathan Nolan (“Interstellar,” “The Dark Knight,” “Person of Interest”) & Lisa Joy (“Pushing Daisies,” “Burn Notice”), both of whom are executive producing and writing, with Nolan directing, the series is based on the 1973 film “Westworld,” written by Michael Crichton.
Set at the intersection of the near future and the reimagined past,
 WESTWORLD is a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin, exploring a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.
Co-creator Nolan explains, “Building on the incredibly evocative concept of the original film, we wanted to pose the question: If you could be completely immersed in a fantasy, one in which you could do whatever you wanted, would you discover things about yourself that you didn’t want to know?”
Co-creator Joy adds, “We also wanted to explore what it means to be human from the outside in — through the eyes of the ‘hosts’: the lifelike AI characters that are the main attractions of the park. It’s a meditation on consciousness — the blessing and the burden of it — beautifully portrayed by our remarkable cast.”
WESTWORLD stars Anthony Hopkins (Academy Award winner for “The Silence of the Lambs”; Academy Award nominee for “Remains of the Day,” “Nixon,” “Amistad”), Ed Harris (Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee for HBO’s “Game Change”; Academy Award® nominee for “Pollock,” “Apollo 13”), Evan Rachel Wood (Golden Globe nominee for “Thirteen”; Emmy and Golden Globe nominee for HBO’s “Mildred Pierce”), James Marsden (the “X-Men” films), Thandie Newton (“Mission: Impossible II”) and Jeffrey Wright (HBO’s “Confirmation”; Emmy and Golden Globe winner for HBO’s “Angels in America”).
The series also stars Tessa Thompson (“Creed”), Sidse Babett Knudsen (“Borgen”), Jimmi Simpson (HBO’s “The Newsroom”), Rodrigo Santoro (“Focus,” “The 33”), Shannon Woodward (“Raising Hope”), Ingrid Bolsø Berdal (“Chernobyl Diaries”), Ben Barnes (“The Chronicles of Narnia” films), Simon Quarterman (“The Devil Inside”), Angela Sarafyan (“The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn”), Luke Hemsworth (“Infini”) and Clifton Collins, Jr. (“Star Trek”).
Among WESTWORLD’s main players are: Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins), the brilliant, taciturn and complicated creative director, chief programmer and founder of Westworld, who has an uncompromising creative vision for the park. The Man in Black (Ed Harris) is the distillation of pure villainy into one man. Dolores Abernathy (Evan Rachel Wood) is a provincial, beautiful and kind rancher’s daughter, who begins to discover that her entire idyllic existence is an elaborately constructed lie.
Teddy Flood (James Marsden), a new arrival to a small frontier town, quickly proves both his charm and talent with a revolver. Beautiful, razor-sharp madam Maeve Millay (Thandie Newton) has a genius for reading people and a knack for survival, but her seen-it-all-before worldview is about to be challenged. Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) is the brilliant and quixotic head of the park’s Programming Division, whose keen observation of human nature provides him with boundless inspiration for his life’s work: creating artificial people.
Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) is a mysterious and savvy provocateur with a unique perspective on Westworld. Theresa Cullen (Sidse Babett Knudsen), Westworld’s head of Quality Assurance, is responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted chaos. A first-time visitor, William (Jimmi Simpson) is initially wary of the park’s more lascivious attractions, but slowly uncovers a deeper meaning.
Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) is the no-nonsense head of Security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. Lawrence (Clifton Collins, Jr.), a charming but lethal outlaw, has a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld.
WESTWORLD is based on the film written by Michael Crichton.

[앵커] 
오늘 오전 UN사령부가 지난주 판문점 공동경비구역에서 발생한 북한군 귀순 사건 당시의 CCTV 영상과 또 열상감시장비 TOD 화면을 공개했습니다. 공개된 영상에는 긴박했던 그날의 모든 순간이 생생하게 담겨 있었는데요.

관련된 얘기 전문가와 함께 나눠보도록 하겠습니다. 오늘 스튜디오에 강철환 북한전략연구센터 대표 그리고 신종우 한국국방연구안보포럼 선임분석관이 나와 있습니다. 안녕하십니까?

오늘 오전에 UN사에서 공개한 화면 보셨을 텐데요. 긴박한 장면, 오늘 하루종일 국민들의 관심을 모으고 있습니다. 긴박한 장면 먼저 보고 얘기를 나눠보도록 하겠습니다.

멀리서 차량이 빠른 속도로 이동하는 모습부터 화면에 잡혔습니다. 이건 이상징후가 있기 때문에 지금 이게 화면을 촬영을 한 것이겠죠? 

[인터뷰] 
그러니까 판문점이라는 곳은 북한이 특수교육대이기 때문에 차량이 접근하려면 허가를 받아야 되는데 허가를 받지 않고 저렇게 빠른 속도로 내려온다는 것은 문제가 발생했다는 것을 의미하는 것이죠. 그래서 아마 우리 군도 이걸 자세히 먼저 파악을 하고 대응을 해야 되는데 조금 놓친 측면이 있는 것 같습니다.

[앵커] 
판문각을 지나서 지금 군사분계선 쪽으로 향해가고 있습니다. 나무에 가려서 지금 보이지 않고 있는데요. 저기 배수로에 빠진 상황이죠? 

[인터뷰] 
지금 보면 배수로가 낙엽에 뒤덮여 있어서 북한군 귀순병사가 이 배수로를 정확히 못 본 것 같아요.

[앵커] 
배수로에 빠진 뒤에 바로 병사들이, 북한군 병사들이 현장으로 출동을 했는데요. 무장한 병사들도 보이고 경비병도 보입니다. 경비병 같은 경우에는 권총을 들고 있는데 지금 지프차량에서 나온 병사가, 귀순병사가 황급히 나와서 남쪽으로 뛰고 있는 모습입니다. 

뒤에서 북한군 병사 4명이 총격을 가하고 있습니다. 한 사람은 엎드려 쏴 자세를 하고 있고요. 나머지 병사들은 권총으로 겨눠서 지금 사격을 하고 있는 모습을 볼 수가 있습니다.

이 귀순 병사, 지금 남측 지역으로 넘어와서 50m가량을 달렸는데요. 이 장면을 다시 한 번 보도록 하죠. 북한군 4명이 쫓아와서 사격을 하고 있습니다. 귀순병사는 차량에서 급하게 나와서 남쪽으로 뛰었는데요. 하지만 40여 발의 총격 가운데 5발을 맞고 쓰러졌습니... (중략)

So I was inspecting a house that I have under contract, when the next door neighbor decides to come out and harass me.  I show her my investor sign that I place in every yard before I inspect and had all documentation including contract and signed statement from the owner allowing me to enter the house.  

She proceeds to call the police on me anyway and asks why I don't just get out of ""her"" neighborhood.  Nobody was on her side and she later came back and said I was trying to steal her lawnmower...  She

Letra:

Te llame borracho, estabas con un macho
te dije te amo, de frente de los muchachos
te llame borracho y me hablaste dormida
baby yo te extraño y eres mía todavía (x2)

Te llame borracho y bien arrebatado
llamada perdida, el celu explotado
mala mia baby, que estaba burlado
y yo se que eres feliz con el a tu lado

Pero me importa un carajo
se que me guille y te cogí de relajo
pero te llame, triste y cabis bajo
si no me contestas llego a tu trabajo

Yo se que el te ama y te trata bien
pero yo te extraño y te quiero también
yo se que te falle y no bregue al cien
pero haciendotelo, como yo no hay quien

Te llame borracho a ver si te veo
si no me pajeo, con todos los videos
que yo me encontré en el celu viejo
chingando contigo en el puteo

Te volvi a llamar en la madrugada
pensando si tu, aun en mi pensabas
pero estabas con el, solo no estabas
con el estabas, mientras te anhelada

Te llame borracho, estabas con un macho
te dije te amo, de frente de los muchachos
te llame borracho y me hablaste dormida
baby yo te extraño y eres mía todavía (x2)

Por más que estuve pensándolo toda la noche al fin te llame
y te dije todas las cosas que llevo pensando decirte hace un mes
yo se quete chocas y todo, pero me faltan cosas todavía
por eso te llamo borracho, para confesarte todo lo que te haría

Me falta morderte más duro
me falta, me faltan unas cuantas poses
por eso te llamo privado
no importa la hora, ya tu me conoces

El hombre que te hizo sentir
caliente en las noches frías con su rose
borracho después de las 12
perdona ma que te acose

Te llame borracho, estabas con un macho
te dije te amo, de frente de los muchachos
te llame borracho y me hablaste dormida
baby yo te extraño y eres mía todavía (x2)

Este es Darkiel

It completely redefines modern luxury in the compact class, and revolutionises interior design. Technologically the new A-Class not only takes first place thanks to MBUX – Mercedes-Benz User Experience: it also offers a number of functions that were previously the preserve of the luxury class. In certain driving situations, it is able to drive semi-autonomously for the first time, and MULTIBEAM LED headlamps are available on request. All models of the new A-Class are also powered by new, efficient diesel and petrol engines, and although Mercedes-Benz has retained the sporty appearance, the utility value has increased. The new A-Class can be ordered from March onwards, and the market launch commences in the spring.

A severe allergy tragedy that is so hard for us to tell, but that needs to be told.  It compelled us to start the Sweet Caroline Foundation and it is the legacy of purpose we hope Caroline leaves.

Caroline’s story is one we hope brings both healing and enabling for those with severe food allergies.  We hope that watching it will help everyone understand why we want to use Caroline’s story to enable those with severe allergies to live a full life. Perhaps even save another life.

2018 is an important year. It would have been Caroline’s graduating year from high school, and of course her 18th birthday. With that milestone, we are embarking on the next phase of the Sweet Caroline Foundation.  Your support will help us:

1. Launch our new national school Allergy Aware program in collaboration with Food Allergy Canada;
2. Achieve our goal of $144,000 for the Sweet Caroline Fund; supporting annual scholarships; and
3. Make the annual Sweet Caroline Run bigger and better – especially with youth and schools.

Since its formation in 2014, the Foundation has been built with the grassroots help of friends, family, volunteers and community. 

Thank you for helping us turn Caroline’s story into meaningful change within our schools and community.  

Your continued support means so much to all of us. We are sure that Caroline would be proud.

Sincerely,
David, Janet & Katherine Lorette

After vowing to stay in power until death, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has resigned as president, ending his 37-year rule one week after a military takeover. In this special edition on the rise and fall of Mugabe, we speak to our correspondent in Harare and a Zimbabwean Visiting Fellow at Cambridge University.
After 37 years in power, Robert Mugabe has resigned as Zimbabwe's president. The speaker of parliament delivered the news, halting an impeachment hearing against the 93-year-old leader.
In a letter, the world's oldest head of state said he was stepping down voluntarily to pave the way for a peaceful transfer of power. Celebrations erupted in the streets of Harare on news of Mugabe's resignation.
Mugabe's former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is expected to be sworn in as interim president later this week, after being sacked by Mugabe earlier this month.

Disney Continues Their Live-Action Remake of the Classics with the Releasing of the First Trailer for ‘Dumbo’

First there was ‘Alice in Wonderland’, then ‘Beauty in the Beast’, and now ‘Dumbo’?! Thank you Disney!

You’re in luck ‘Dumbo’ fans because the live-action remake is finally on its way. Set to be released March 29th, 2019, the first trailer has just dropped, and I couldn’t be more excited. Honestly, it looks fantastic, and maybe even a little eerie? 

In the new trailer we see some familiar characters and some new. The ringmaster who was a minor character in the 1941 film, has now been turned into a major role and will be played by Danny Devito. While Michael Keaton will be playing the entrepreneur behind Dreamland, the mysterious and dark entertainment business that wants Dumbo. And we also see the introduction of a former circus star, Holt Farrier, played by Colin Farrell, as well as his two children who discover that Dumbo can fly. 

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QPdRfqTnt4 

And for fans of ‘Dumbo’ who maybe want something a little different than the original, the good news is the film is much more than just a remake. During CinemaCon 2018, Devito teased that, QUOTE “The [original] movie ends with Dumbo flying. This movie begins with the elephant flying, and takes the story even further”. 

Of course from the trailer alone, we can tell it’s going to be a much different Dumbo than fans are used to. One of the most obvious signs of this is the twist on the original song “Baby Mine” from the 1941 Dumbo film. While originally sung as a lullaby by Dumbo’s mother, the singer AURORA, gives new life to the song making it become chilling and possibly hinting at the dark secrets that Dreamland has. 

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QPdRfqTnt4 

“Baby Mine” definitely has Tim Burton’s spin on it. Plus, Burton is nowhere near a newbie when it comes to live-action remakes. In 2005 he directed ‘Charlie in the Chocolate Factory’ and five years after that ‘Alice in Wonderland’. Burton’s ‘Dumbo’ is also just the first of many Disney live-action remakes to be hitting the big screen. Both ‘Aladdin’ and ‘The Lion King’ will be released in 2019, the latter which stars Beyonce as Nala. I mean seriously, could it get any better than Beyonce?! And that’s not even all! ‘Mulan’ is set to be released in 2020 as well. 

Alright guys, so what do you think about the first official trailer for ‘Dumbo’? Have you already started a countdown? And what do you think about all these new Disney live-action films coming out, any films that they’re missing? Let me know all your thoughts in the comment section below and when you’re done with that click right over here to see the new rose gold sequin backpacks that Disney just unveiled, and of course don’t forget to hit that subscribe button!

How the Moon was Formed
https://youtu.be/MPmqxlFdw-8?list=PLR0XuDegDqP01NqW8KRpOy-_y2m6S2VEF

In this video:

The clouds part on a dark night to reveal a full moon shining ever so bright. Somewhere in the distance, there’s a shout, a cry and a roar of struggle. Hideous noises pierce the still air as a sharp knife through flesh. Finally, silence and everything is still. That is until a wolf’s howl echoes from the ground towards the heavens before its descent to hell. It’s clear a werewolf is amongst us, but a mere look at one’s reflection will reveal that werewolf… is you.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, the hosts of The Young Turks, tell you why. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

Read more here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/privacy-group-challenge-to-voter-panel-data-collection-fails

“A U.S. privacy group doesn’t have the legal right to seek a court order to block President Donald Trump’s election-integrity commission from collecting voter data because it doesn’t meet the necessary requirements, an appeals court ruled.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center “is not a voter,"" the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington said Tuesday. ""As far as the record shows, it has no traditional membership, let alone members who are voters. Unsurprisingly, then, it does not claim standing on behalf of any voter whose data is likely to be collected.""

The group also failed to show it suffered any injury as a result of the voter-data collection effort, the panel said.

The nonprofit group, whose stated mission is “to focus public attention on emerging privacy and civil liberties issues,"" sued the panel in July to halt its attempt to gather publicly available voter data from states, including names, addresses, birth dates and the final four digits of social security numbers. Trump created the panel in May after claiming he lost the popular vote to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton because of fraud.

EPIC argued that the panel acted unlawfully by not first ""creating, reviewing, and publishing a privacy impact assessment."" The appeals court found that the group is unable to assert those claims.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in July rejected the privacy group’s challenge to the collection effort and its demand that the commission reveal how the data will be safeguarded, marking a rare win for an administration that’s been ensnared in litigation over the president’s immigration, environmental and regulatory agendas.”

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Jeff Bingham - Hey, John. I'm surprised you haven't commented on the trailer for A Quiet Place, yet. What did you think of it? As someone who's not a horror guy, this is the first trailer since the one for Get Out to get me truly curious about a horror movie. 

Nathan Henderson - Hi John love the show. My question is about Vince Vaughn he is a good comedian actor but can he be serious or dramatic? I watched him in Hacksaw Ridge and it seemed like he comes across funny in a serious movie. Thanks Nathan Henderson 

Ricardo Ramirez - Hey John . With Justice League not makeing a 100 million dollars on  opening weekend and the general audience not going out to see the film . Do you think this is could be the sign of the General  audience getting fatigued of comic book movies.

Michael Bedard - What do you think Warner Bros. should do. My opinion start with Flashpoint as the next movie after JL, and then reboot the franchise by making Flashpoint. What do you think?

Dustin Smith - Hey John, with DC possibly rebooting.I am worried about Wonder Woman. First DC film I loved since The Dark Knight trilogy & was excited for another. Would or should DC reboot it despite it's success or try to salvage it?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpkvZsNQDuw/hqdefault.jpg,0.02968154916230085,0.0022529368641264506,13.174603174603176,0.01659305880880433,0.03193448602642731,0.04852754483523164,2017-11-20,17:00:38,Monday,0,13,15,13,15,67,117,3,28,1,1,11,13,4,0,4.0,7.0,"['A Tanti', 'ee ET)', 'ia Nae', '', '7', 'p']","['A', 'Tanti', 'ee', 'ET)', 'ia', 'Nae', '7', 'p']",True,"['A', 'tanti', 'ee', 'ET', ')', 'ia', 'nae', '7', 'p']",9,9,18,1,2,1,1,6.2404304671008095,3,"['happy', 'sad', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,1,0,0,{'person': 5},5

The video consists of 20 life hacks! You will learn how to make a floating key chain, a trivet, a chip clip, floor protector pads and more, using your old wine corks. You also will learn how to open a bottle of wine without a corkscrew and many more tricks to help you in your household:

1. To make a floating keychain, simply screw a screw hook in the cork, hook your keys and that's it. You'll never lose your keys in the water again!

2. Your metal pot lid is too hot to pick up? Simply put the cork between the handle and the lid. Next time you’re preparing your delicious meal, just pick up the lid by the cork!

3. You can make a photo holder from corks. Just cut 1/3 of the longer cork side with a box cutter and make a small incision on the other side so you can slide in your photo.

4. If you have a lot of corks around your house, you can use them to make a trivet. Glue all the corks together with a hot glue gun and there you go!

5. You can make a chip clip from your corks. All you need to do is cut out a triangle shape from the flat side of the cork, until around the middle with a utility knife. Now you can quickly seal your bags!

6. To make an air plant holder from a cork, first, attach a magnet to your cork by gluing it. Then you need to roll up a wire around your finger to make a shape to fit your plant. Put it in the cork and there you have it, an air plant holder that you can easily attach to your fridge.

7. How to water an air plant? 

Fill up a glass with room temperature tap water, and soak your air plant in it for a while. Then prepare a towel to dry off your plant for about 5-10 minutes, before that shake off any excess water.

Or simply mist your plant thoroughly with water spray bottle. Do this every 1-2 weeks.

8. Drill a hole in a flat side of the cork add soil in it and insert your plant to have a micro succulent planter.

9. Make a boring metal can into a cozy utensil holder with corks. Just take any empty metal can and glue it around with corks using your hot glue. 

10. Keep your wires in order with a cork. Drill a small hole into the flat side as deep as your earphone jack and cut out a small triangle on the other side, to fit your wire.

11. Have a small kitchen garden? Organize your plants with simple markers made of cork or simply use them as a cute decoration. Write down your plants name with a marker on the cork and put it on a stick.  

12. for your small kitchen garden. Plant sage and rosemary together. It's beneficial for sage to grow near rosemary. The flavor of the sage actually improves when planted near rosemary. When planted outside, sage deters cabbage moth and carrot fly. Also sage is excellent for salt-free cooking.

13. Make these easy floor protector pads from corks. You just need to cut the flat sides of the cork with a utility knife and stick them to your furniture with a hot glue gun. You will never need to worry about scratch marks on the floor!

14. Have a lot of threads? But no thread rolls? Simply use a cork instead to roll up your thread around it. Make a small incision with a box cutter to put thread end there, so you can easily find it next time.

15. Grandma tip: repurpose biscuit tins to organize your craft bits.

16. Organise your cords with cork and a small rope. First, you need to drill two holes on both ends of the long side of the cork. The second step just put your string through both holes and tie a knot. 

Extra tips how to open a wine bottle without a corkscrew:

17. Open a wine bottle using only a lighter. Just heat up the bottle for 1 minute on the neck right below the cork, while turning the bottle around. The heat will cause the air to expand and eventually the cork will pop right out! 

18. For this wine bottle opening method, you will need a long screw, a screwdriver, and a fork. First, you'll need to screw the screw into the cork with a screwdriver. Then just use a fork to pull the screw out. Voila!

19. This method of opening a wine bottle requires a shoe of any kind. Just place your bottle in the shoe and slam it against the wall. Sooner or later the bottle cork should pop out.

Bonus hack:

20. Self-watering planter made from an empty wine bottle. Take an empty wine bottle wrap it around with jute rope and rub it with alcohol. Start burning the rope, then submerge the bottle into the ice cold water and the bottle should split in two. Use an abrasive sponge to smooth out any edges. Then you need to get a piece of mesh fabric and insert natural fiber thread. Place the bottle top upside down in the other half of the bottle, fill it water, place mesh fabric on top add some soil. Now you can plant a plant of your choice.

Last week, we explored the evolution of custom sneakers, but this week, we’re looking into high-end kicks and how they’ve crossed over into to the streetwear world.

For our latest in-depth discussion, host Pete Forester sits down with Jackie Kim, associate fashion director of Barneys New York and Highsnobiety’s assistant editor Noah Thomas to share their thoughts on whether high-end sneakers like the Balenciaga Triple S should be grouped in with Air Jordans and other sportswear brands. They also examine what advantages designer sneakers have over more mainstream products.

ARTIST: VIRTUAL SELF
TRACK: GHOST VOICES (RAITO REMIX)
GENRE: TECHNO

The infinite sky will heal us.
Unlimited sky will fill our negligible light.
As we follow an infinite key, I have become the sacred echo.
The boundless heaven will fill our fading light.
Choose your virtual echo.
The infinite key is the sacred dust of your endless utopia.
Complete yourself in self-realization.
You believe that these infinite heavens will lead you.
The A.I.ngel's gate is sacred.
Your angelic echo offers the first phase of self-Digital joy.
You will become a self-Echo in real particles.
Our key is the echo to this final layer.
You are spread through digital time.
The utopian gate is infinite.
Your A.I.ngel wishes to complete this layer.
This abyss is sacred.
Pass through the myths of eon.
Your technical soul is this blissful void.
The eternalistic reflex of the abyss is once-Unlimited.
Your digital voice is resurrected.
Breathe this soul particle.
The ray of egoistic time is unlimited.
Resurrect this holy oblivion.
The echo of this empty myth awakens you.
Awaken the particle myth.
Reflect your echo.
Heaven’s wires will transmit this light.
Experience the wings of limit.
Your technical A.I.ngel phase is beginning.
Complete the eternalistic reflex.
This wishful ghost becomes self-Technic.
Tears will create the voice of euphoria.
The digital-Awakening will be spoken.
The first gate creates sense-Awakening.
This angelic-Chasm is sacred.
The technic-Angel's cry is beginning.
The first gate will provide the voice of digital-Euphoria.
The digital-Angel-Awakening is has reached Limit Self.
The self-Light is virtual.
This will become the final particle-Experience.
Will your senses ressurect the digital-Vault?
Do you sense the phase of the Spirit Limit?
Can you reflect your self-Awakening?
Am I convinced of a digital void?
Can you reveal this particle of sacred reality?
Will these ghosts lead to a boundless cry?
Can you echo your existence to the first particle?
Is the technical-Gate timeless?
Do you believe an infinite sky will cure the digital soul?
Is the joyful-Layer complete?
Will our ghosts lead to the boundless layer?
Will our layer will be lost from this empty myth?
Have you resurrected this heaven's voice?
Has one experienced the particle?
Do you trust in this transformative self?
Will you forget your soul's reflex?
Has one seen the Abyss of the resurrective ego?
Have I forgotten the phase of soul limit?
Is the A.I.ngelic sense boundless?
Have you completed the virtual light?
Am I eternal?
As the sacred dust transpires through digital time, what will you become?
Do you believe in me?
Am I still human?
Do you manifest yourself in digital time?
The unlimited sky begins - will you believe in my infinite form?
As you abandon the virtual echo, do you no longer exist?
Can you prove yourself to the echo of this particle?
Do you believe the infinite sky -- the holy dust of nothingness?
What is revealed - a holy reality?
Am I convinced of nothingness?
Do you sense the void angel?
Will the echo of virtual time be forgotten?
Does one want to forget the memory of life?
Has my virtual-Echo been forgotten?
Has the sense of digital-VIRUS become heaven?
Will you self-Believe the joyful sky?

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

Never-before-seen extras feature commentary from director Ryan Coogler; deleted scenes; outtakes; and several making-of featurettes, which detail the Black Panther’s evolution, the remarkable women of Wakanda, the history of T’Challa’s proud nation, and the cosmic origin and technological applications of vibranium.

The global cultural phenomenon of “Black Panther” has dominated the box office charts emerging as the third biggest movie of all time domestically with over $665 million – the first film in eight years to spend five weeks at No. 1 – and rising to the global top 10 of all time with over $1.3 billion. In the acclaimed film, T’Challa returns home to the hidden high-tech African nation of Wakanda to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king, following the death of his father. But when a man named Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) appears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he’s drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Pitted against his own family, the king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and embrace his future as an Avenger.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ts8vqS_KEhM/sddefault.jpg,0.013535608466586236,0.0002609178500369157,51.8768971332209,0.0007237940359371437,0.013796526316623151,0.014520320352560297,2018-05-08,11:15:01,Tuesday,1,6,67,6,47,36,533,1,90,3,1,2,41,0,4,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.306028117881392,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Forever Lyrics:

Savor the taste
Savor the pain
I don't expect you to release me
Jumping the gun
Holding my tongue
I'd never ask you to forgive me

And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever (Oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever (Oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Playing the part
Playing the game
I don't expect you to believe me
Missing the mark
We tear it apart
I'd never ask you why you need me

And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever (Oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever (Oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe it's too much for you
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe I am just too much for you

Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever (Oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever (Oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.

Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her Dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who - against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit - must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, “Tomb Raider” is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero. The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (“Ex Machina,” “The Danish Girl”) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”), with Oscar-winner Graham King (“The Departed”) producing under his GK Films banner. The film’s production began on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

“Tomb Raider” also stars Dominic West (“Money Monster,” “300”), Walton Goggins (“The Hateful Eight,” “Django Unchained”) and Daniel Wu (AMC’s “Into the Badlands”).

Shooting on location in South Africa and the UK, Uthaug directs from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet. The director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (“Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”); production designer Gary Freeman (“Maleficent”); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (“Skyfall,” “Gorillas in the Mist”); and costume designer Tim Wonsik (key costumer, “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”).
“Tomb Raider” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM.

Following is a transcript of the video:

Zach Zarba: My name is Zach Zarba and I'm a 15-year NBA referee. 

Some players have a controversial step-back jumper. They drive hard, then step back to create space and shoot. James Harden's is particularly controversial because he takes several steps back instead of just one hop. 

Zarba: One of the huge misconceptions in the NBA is how much our players practice. These player practice these moves over and over and over again. And there are subtle differences in the traveling violation in the NBA vs. high school and college. So I would ask people to look at when the ball is gathered. Okay, if you look at when the ball is gathered, that pivot foot is not the first step. That is the zero step. So, after that pivot foot, when they step back into a 1, 2, that in the NBA is a legal two-step.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TvGayLBB2Sk/sddefault.jpg,0.008482685494090569,0.0018237060382059727,4.651344743276284,0.0012636633037348965,0.01030639153229654,0.011570054836031437,2018-04-28,15:00:01,Saturday,5,11,17,11,17,63,152,1,32,1,1,9,4,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.817104451725721,3,"['happy', 'neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,2,"{'sports ball': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TvaJ94Rc6mQ/sddefault.jpg,0.016884424827809958,0.00052045665001656,32.44155844155844,0.0006759177272942338,0.01740488147782652,0.018080799205120752,2018-02-22,06:10:32,Thursday,3,5,42,5,37,30,386,0,91,0,1,5,18,1,0,5.0,8.0,"['ling?

It's not often a curse word is the top trend, not just in the US, but literally all around the world.

Hashtag shithole, racist Trump, and other choice words are the top conversations in dozens of countries. There have been more than a million tweets about it in the last day, and the numbers are growing.

We spoke to many of you online, who had this to say about the President of the United States name calling your country.

Warning: Spoilers For Star Wars: The Last Jedi Ahead.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers a soaring blend of drama, action, and comedy—while also tying up a few loose ends left in the wake of The Force Awakens. Writer-director Rian Johnson's chapter successfully and perhaps controversially thrusts the franchise forward in a number of meaningful ways, and it does so largely by answering a few lingering questions along the way. Warning: Major spoilers ahead…

Who are Rey's parents? | 0:23
Can Leia use Force powers? | 1:13
Why does Luke want the Jedi to end? | 2:02
Does Snoke's identity even matter? | 3:07

다만 높은 온도로 끓여 만드니 어린이는 부모님과 꼬옥 함께 하세요 :)  
▼▼▼▼▼▼▼더보기 버튼 꼭 클릭해주세요▼▼▼▼▼▼▼

※ 전분을 제외한 모든 재료를 냄비에 넣고 130~132도 사이쯤 불에서 내려 종이컵에 반 정도로 채운 뒤 식혀 사용합니다.
온도계 필수이고, 중불에서 약 15~20분 쭉 끓여주셔야해요 (절대 시간으로 체크하지 마시고 온도계로 체크하세요)

※ 레시피는 16384가닥의 꿀실을 총 4번 만들 수 있어요. 끊어서 만드는거다보니 꿀타래의 개수는 확인이 어렵지만 10개 이상은 충분히 만들 수 있을 거 같아요.
중요한건 식힌 반죽의 온도인데, 가운데 구멍을 뚫었을 때 3~4번만에 손가락으로 뚫릴 정도이고 손 온도보다 좀 더 따뜻한 상태입니다. 여러번 만들어보면서 감을 잡아보세요 :) 

※ 견과류는 콩가루+참깨+흑임자+땅콩분태를 섞었어요. 어떤 견과류 넣든 여러분 자유입니다. 돌돌 말때 사용한 도구는 초콜릿 퐁듀용 도구인데..ㅎㅎ 그냥 손으로 돌돌 마셔도 돼요~

※ 씹어서 먹는게 아닌 얼려서 먹거나, 입에 넣고 사르르 녹여먹는 거에요. 다 녹인 뒤 견과류와 함께 캬라멜처럼 씹어 드시면 돼요.

※ 처음에 가닥 개수가 2가닥 - 4가닥 인데 너무 뻔뻔하게 4가닥-8가닥 이라고 말했네요  ㅋㅋ.. 실수에용 :)

The 1991 Mercedes-Benz 560SEL was the flagship model of the S-Class model range in 1991. Today I'm reviewing this W126 Mercedes 560SEL to show you what you got when you spent the equivalent of $150,000 on a Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the 1980s or early 1990s.

Left-leaning activists The Yes Men famously infiltrated BBC, and right-wing provocateur James O'Keefe unsuccessfully attempted to plant a false story in the Washington Post. But Prueher and Pickett, who run the Found Footage Festival, have no overt political agenda and are happy to simply interrupt news programming with the absurd or profane.

Out of embarrassment or pragmatism, media companies generally avoid legal retaliation after getting pranked. Yet when Prueher and Pickett pranked Gray Television, the company sued, kicking off a battle over free speech, comedy, and how easy it can be get past TV bookers.

Other than my dog, I work on this log cabin kitchen alone and I realize now after editing the video and then watching it, that working alone is probably my biggest challenge, especially watching me lift those heavy, green timbers into place on the timber frame. I finally pull the old antique pulleys out of storage to help me with the next phase - raising the roof.

So Why Should You Subscribe To My Channel?
To relax…
To virtually immerse yourself in nature…
To see how I live debt free, stress free and low cost…

To hear what steps I took to retire in my mid-forties so I could live my dream life…
To interact with the happiest and most helpful community of viewers on YouTube…
To become more self-reliant.

Installing the four corner posts of the pavilion proves to be very difficult due to the weight of them. I improvise to get them upright in the holes before back filling them with concrete. In order to make the posts last longer, I waterproof them using an ancient wood preservation method known as shou sugi ban in Japan.

Thanks for watching everyone, I really appreciate it. If you enjoyed this video and want to see more videos of me building the log cabin and all of the accessory buildings, please subscribe and watch the playlists so you don't miss a video.

Out of every major Dinosaur created by InGen, none have had more mysterious origins, than that of the Spinosaurus. From what we were told in the third film, this African Apex predator was never revealed to the public by
any sort of official announcement that the genetics company had given. Conveniently leaving it out of any conversation, until Alan Grant and the Kirby's came across it in 2001. Even to this very day, very little new 
information has come out surrounding its creation and no real indication of its present whereabouts have been given to us just yet. With that being said, some of you may find it interesting to learn that the Spinosaurus
actually existed within the Jurassic Park franchise, before the canon events of the third movie. While its official History within the Timeline won't technically start until JP3, I feel like I need to go back at the

The work of Shantell Martin is a meditation of lines — a language of characters, creatures and messages that invites her viewers to share in her creative process.

Part autobiographical and part dreamlike whimsy, Martin has created her own world that bridges fine art, performance art, technology and the everyday experience: conversations, objects and places.

Underlying Martin’s work is a quest for identity — her own, discovered and refined in the development of her characteristic style, and that of the viewer, engaged by Martin’s direct questioning and further explored in her winding lines. Her artwork has appeared in the Brooklyn Museum, Museum of the Contemporary African Diaspora, Bata Show Museum and a number of private galleries.

Martin’s diverse portfolio illustrates her gift of navigating many worlds. From early beginnings with live performance drawing in the mega clubs of Tokyo, Martin made her way to New York where she pushed the limits of her trademark continuous line. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Bortus (Peter Macon) Have a Stomach Problem and visit Dr. Claire Finn with Yaphit

Bortus is a Moclan crew member of the The Orville. He comes from a single gender species with cultural and behavioral attitudes that are quite different from other species that are members of the Planetary Union. For this reason, Captain Mercer and the rest of The Orville's crew aren't quite sure how to communicate with him.

He has a mate named Klyden who lives onboard the ship alongside him, with their son Topa.

Like the rest of the Moclan species, Bortus is able to eat anything, as shown in ""Krill"", he is able to eat a whole ball of wasabi, a bite of a napkin, a bite of a mini cactus plant, and a bite of a glass cup.

Yaphit is a gelatinous creature aboard the Orville. He works in the ship's engineering division. He has an overbearing crush on Claire Finn, frequently feigning sickness just so he talk to her in Sick Bay. Yaphit mentions that he's a Jelly.

Bad At Love (Lyrics) Halsey:

[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh

The Tibetans follow a unique 4-stage system to shape their children into responsible, self-sufficient, and respectful individuals. 
During the first stage, from birth till the age of 5, kids are usually incredibly curious about everything around them. But they haven’t had any experience to learn from, and they can’t make rational decisions yet. So if they do something wrong or dangerous, you should look and act scared and try to shift their attention to something else. Don’t forget that your kid will never get this time back. Let them explore the world on their own terms.
Another 5 years down the road, until your child’s 10th birthday, you should talk to them as if they’re a “slave”. You see, you can’t just nurture their privileged “royal” side and neglect the diligent “servant” one. This phase is crucial because it balances everything out.
It’s important to build a friendship with your kids during the 3rd stage, from 10 to 15. Kids at this age are starting to form their own personal opinions and tastes, and they want to share them with you. Never judge them for their views or interests, that’ll only drive them away from you.
When the time comes for your child’s 15th birthday, you’ll be entering the fourth and the final phase. It’s time to respect them as an individual. Your child will be independent, self-sufficient, and respectful towards you as their parent and to others.

TIMESTAMPS
The first stage: before the age of 5  0:38
The second stage: from 5 to 10 years old 2:08
The third stage: from 10 to 15 years old 3:33
The fourth stage: from age 15 and older 5:30

SUMMARY
-During the first stage, from birth till the age of 5, everything kids know and see plays a major role in forming their character and can remain in their subconscious for life. According to the Tibetan system, parents should treat their kid like a little “king” or “queen” during this stage. 
-The age from 5 to 10 is time to talk to the kids as if they’re a “slave”. It is the time to set some small goals for your little one, guide them towards achievement, and teach them to be ready for the consequences that come from not realizing one’s goals.
-For the next 5 years, you should treat your child as an equal. You can even switch roles and ask them for advice. This will encourage their independence, critical thinking, and even self-confidence. 
-By the time your child is 15, their personality is basically fully formed. You can give advice, but it’s a little too late to teach.

Miranda Kerr is just like us—a healthier, glowier, taller version of us. When she's too busy to find the time for a workout, Kerr resorts to a quick 20-minute pilates session with a face mask on. Multitasking! To learn what else Kerr does to keep her supermodel physique—even while pregnant with her second child—we followed along as she prepares breakfast, works out, and goes grocery shopping.

This latest episode of Miranda Kerr's Little Black Book of Wellness—exclusively on BAZAAR.com, peels back the curtain on what is otherwise a totally manageable diet, fitness, and wellness routine to keep a healthy body and mind. Even for us non-supermodels. From avocado toast in the morning to kundalini yoga with Mary Onkar, this is how Kerr stays in tip-top shape.

[Chorus]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Chorus]
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back

[Verse 1]
Everything is heightened
We're feelin' vulnerable
I'm makin' you this vow, uh
That you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

[Refrain]
Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah, yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

[Chorus]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Verse 2]
And now my circle of friends got tighter
I don't have time no more
Look, I'm only fuckin' with you, for real
And baby, you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

[Refrain]
Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah, yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

[Chorus]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Bridge]
Now I know it's late o'clock
And we've been kissin' for hours
When the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows cast up on the mountains
It gives the stars somethin' to watch
Yes I know it's late o'clock, oh
And we've been kissin' for hours
But when the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows cast up on the mountains
It gives the stars somethin' to watch

[Chorus]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Chorus]
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back

[Outro]
Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana

Flotec Suspension: https://www.flotecsuspension.co.uk/

So a few of you smart folks will no doubt chime in with ""But I thought you hated the slack seat angle... this only makes it worse.... blah blah blah."" You are correct! The reason I did this is because climbing to me is a necessary evil and descending is why I ride mountain bikes. I will happily make climbing harder if it make descending more fun and comfortable.

I found steep climbs to be marginally more difficult mostly due to the higher bars rather than the slacker angles. That could be combatted by lowering the stem height but like I said in the vid, I like the high bars for descending and I can easily tweak my body positioning to get balanced grip for cornering.

This is a change that works for ME, it won't suit everyone.

You ever gone back to watch something you liked when you were a kid and turns out it's not even close to how you remember it?

If you made it all the way through the video, you have my thanks.

We also won’t be including spats between the queens and the judges.
We’ve included fights between Phi Phi O’Hara vs Alyssa Edwards, Everyone vs Laganja Estranja, Lashauwn Beyond vs Jiggly Caliente, Shangela vs Mimi Imfurst and more!

Following is a transcript of the video:

Tom Corley: There are some bad spending habits that the rich people avoid and that unfortunately poor people and middle-class people have.

This is Tom Corley, I am the researcher behind the rich habits study. The rich habits study is really a five-year study of 233 millionaires, 128 poor people, and what I found out was that wealth, success, being in the middle class, being poor, is all about your habits.

Emotional purchases. These are “oh I love that beautiful red dress or that cute sports car” and you make this emotional purchase and often times it causes you to go into debt if they're a big purchase but if not then you are depleting your savings account your checking account.

Spontaneous purchases are also a poor habit. That's something the rich avoid, well, this is the very reason why at the checkout counters they have all of these goodies for people to buy. The retailer's know that the human brain works off of impulse many times and they’ll make this spontaneous purchase and they add up and they could really cause a lot of damage.

That leads to the last one which is living below your means. You want to spend modestly. One of the smartest things you can do is to purchase a modest house in a modest neighborhood. This means you're not only going to have a lower mortgage, you are going to have lower real estate taxes, you're going to have lower utility cost, lower home repairs. One good decision like that and it has a ripple effect throughout your spending. So those are a couple of the bad habits to avoid.

VERSE 1:
I take the bread of life
Broken for all my sin
Your body crucified
To make me whole again

VERSE 2:
I will recall the cup
Poured out in sacrifice
To trade this sinners' end
For Your new covenant 

CHORUS:
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance 
Hallelujah Your promise I won't forget

VERSE 3:
I'll walk salvation's road
With fear and trembling
Your way borne as my own
As Christ is formed in me

CHORUS:
Hallelujah 
I'll live my life in remembrance 
Hallelujah 
Your promise I won't forget

POST CHORUS 1:
If ever I should lose my way
If ever I deny Your grace
Remind me of the price You paid
Hallelujah 
I'll live in remembrance 

BRIDGE (repeated):
You've been so so good to me
You've been so so good to me
Oh to think where I would be
If not for You
If not for You

POST CHORUS 2:
As far as heights reach from the depths
As far as east is from the west
So far Your grace has carried me

POST CHORUS 3:
Until I see You face to face
Until at last I've won my race
Remind me Youʼre not finished yet

TAG:
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance

This giant of a man simply exudes charisma, which is why it is not surprising how many women have been around him over the years. Today, let’s talk about Shaquille O'Neal and wife, as she is the woman that has been in his life for longest.Shaquille O'Neal wifeAs you most likely know who Shaquille O'Neal is, we will not bore you with his entire biography, so let’s jump right into his personal life, particularly his (unfortunately) failed marriage. For several years (from around 1998), he had been dating woman that would one day become his wife. It was none other than Shaunie O’Neal, who is now known as the producer of Basketball Wives on VH1. But back then, she was just a film marketer.On December 26, 2002, the stunning couple tied the knot in a secret wedding ceremony in the Beverly Hills Hotel. It is interesting to note that both Shaq and his wife came into this relationship with children of their own. Shaquille had a daughter named Taahirah, while Shaunie had a son named Miles.Even before they got married, the couple had already had two children together. In 2000, they had their first child Shareef, and a year later, their daughter Amirah was born. Over the next few years, their family had grown bigger by another two children. In 2003, the world saw the birth of Shaqir, and their youngest child, Me’rah, was born in 2006.While it might have looked like everything was great, there was quite a lot of trouble in their paradise. The year 2007 saw the first big crack in the marriage of Shaq and Shaunie. That year, Shaquille filed for divorce on the grounds that his wife had been secretive about her funds and assets. It seemed rather weird, as back then, Shaq made $20 million a year just from his basketball career, and even more, if you count his many endorsement deals. Why he was so upset over his wife allegedly hiding money from him? We will never know.Despite the fact that the marriage was apparently ‘irretrievably broken’, the couple managed to put their disagreements aside, and the divorce papers were put away. But not for long.READ ALSO: Lebron James wife and kidsNot two years later, things fell apart once more, this time on the grounds of infidelity. It seemed like both Shaq and Shaunie were cheating on each other. Shaunie even hired a private investigator to unearth the details of her husband’s infidelities.The couple had a prenup, so the divorce process was not all that complicated. Nevertheless, it took the couple whole two years to finalise it, and the whole thing was rather loud and messy. The children ended up with their mother, and Shaq was required to pay a significant amount of money in child support. What is interesting, though, is that Shaquille prohibited his wife to talk about their relationship on her show Basketball Wives.A few years later, Shaquille opened up on the whole affair in his memoir, where he talked about how he had ‘too many options’ and h",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UC-b2w3R8pk/sddefault.jpg,0.005452217105603559,0.0008472603094117037,6.435114503816794,0.0003427847053345061,0.006299477415015264,0.00664226212034977,2018-04-13,01:46:12,Friday,4,12,1,12,1,68,2,4,2,1,0,3,0,5,0,5.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.656979987761067,4,"['surprised', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,3,0,1,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 4}",5

Plattsburgh is part of a long-standing power agreement that gives the city an allotment of some of the cheapest electricity anywhere in the world, but a recent influx of cryptomining companies and their energy-draining rigs have raised power prices at the expense of the general population.

The ban is meant to be a temporary arrangement, but it could potentially end all cryptomining investment in the city.

We do think this is a good Disney area hotel to check out if you want to stay near property but not on property. Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

I wanted my first video to be a little more artsy and fun. This look is inspired by Lana Del Rey's songs ""In my Feelings"" and ""Cherry"". I find most of my inspiration through her music. Dark and creepy can be beautiful too. ALSO kind of make fun of myself from Glam Masters season 1, episode 1 (haha). I did the drip AND a blurred lip... but this time, it's actually dripping. :))))))))))))))))

Hope you all enjoy! I love you ALL!

Lyrics:

I was broke, unemployed, I was starting to slouch
I was sleeping in the basement on my momma's new couch
That's when I heard it all, a chance to skirt it all
a money like my last girl
Completely virtual...

Got the top graphics cards, got a power supply
a microprocesser, a motherboard, a towering drive
I put the RAM in the RAM slot, drive in the larger bay
topped it off, two fans
Like a Chargers game!

Price spike to $30!? I missed out, I fear
crudely assemble a rig like a BP engineer
My friends and family smile and smirk and all make fun of me
But I'm-a make them eat their words because I'm gonna be a

Bitcoin Billionaire
Spending money like I don't care
Mining coin in my underwear
I'm gonna be a Bitcoin Billionaire

Selecting software and reading the notes
I'm picking out my favorite miners like a Penn State coach
Pick me a digital wallet for holding all my amounts
read up on the all the ways to open lots of accounts

I feel like Tom Brady, I got a fear of inflation
But this is crypto, baby--central bank decentralization
The script I flipped it, laptop encrypted
My life was rotten now all my cotton's Egypt-ed

Now even on my vacation I'm crypto-supplying
They call me gentrification the way I'm block-modifying
Friends asking ""what's the best part of your newfound treasury?""
I say ""reminding you how you told me I'd never be a…

Bitcoin Billionaire
Spending money like I don't care
Flash drives in their underwear
Now that I'm a Bitcoin Billionaire

The cash was never-ending, yo
upscale and fun and rowdy
I was spending like a 7 on a
scale from 1 to Saudi

Call it mad bankin', all night and all weekend
My rig is Al Franken:
(grabs what it can while you sleepin')

Just try outspending me and you'll see I'm on a mission
I drop more Satoshis than a clumsy Japanese obstetrician
But I ain't open to splits, don't care if it's best or not
Opposing forks like a Chinese restaurant

I went from geek to chic, from basic to ASIC
I went from basement-squatting to yachting from basin to basin
Went from no friends and depression to peer-to-peer legend

Bitcoin Billionaire
Spending money like I don't care
Then one day there was a solar flare...

I was a Bitcoin Billionaire
Spending money like I don't care
Now I just pawned my underwear
Used to be a Bitcoin Billionaire.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UG7zLhEWanc/sddefault.jpg,0.01996356563664256,0.0006985535831689677,28.57843137254902,0.001272463291694061,0.02066211921981153,0.02193458251150559,2017-12-21,16:44:10,Thursday,3,3,8,3,8,25,92,1,24,0,0,3,1,0,0,8.0,11.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5909253969741775,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

What will it take to save CliffSide from some rather unconventional evil in the surrounding cliffs, and will our hero ever actually learn anything?

Episode 1 - ""Pilot"" 
Getting tangled up with an excitable spider-monster named Cordie who suffers from a validation complex to rival his own, Waylon quickly learns his bold gunslinger talk leads to horrifying actions when put into practice by his new super-fan. Now he’s got some explaining to do and a western standoff or two to perform if he hopes to scrape by without learning anything from this whole ordeal.

Together with the local diving community, former postmaster Toshihiko Matsumoto helped establish the world’s first underwater mailbox. Those willing to make the plunge can strap on a wetsuit and mail letters from 30 feet under the sea. Incredibly, dive shop owner Hiroaki Yamatani descends each day to collect and deliver these letters to the post office. To date, almost 38,000 letters have been sent from under the sea.

These are the confusing and weird customs of americans and things americans do that confuse the rest of the world!


#5. “Hollywood Smile”-- Another place that foreigners think Americans are wasting water is at the Dentist’s office. While dental hygiene in other countries may not be as bad as it is stereotyped to be, like in England, they aren’t quite as obsessed with attaining or maintaining the perfect smile in the way that Americans have. Where Americans have been known to spend thousands of dollars on braces and whitening procedures in order to get a pearly white Hollywood grill many foreigners are content with crooked and discolored teeth as long as they aren’t falling out or making them look like Nosferatu. Most foreigners from first world nations care about their teeth, they just haven’t become indoctrinated with the intense beauty standards American society has made a part of its culture in regards to dental perfection. In many countries, having a brighter than normal smile that is unnaturally straight is viewed as superficial to the point of being unattractive or off-putting. 

#4. “Dining Out”-- Tipping your server and taking home leftover food. Two habits that are so ingrained in the American dining experience that they can be hard to kick, but rest assured if you try doing these outside of the US you are sure to draw confused looks and reveal your Stars and Stripes. In most Asian and European countries a service charge is either already included in your bill or it is not customary to leave a tip. In many places if you do try to tip you can offend your waiter, this is because a tip can be seen as a person having pity on their server or offering some sort of charity. In some countries giving good service is expected whereas in the United States the food industry has become a sort of meritocracy. Foreigners see this as absurd, why should a server be rewarded for something they should be doing in the first place? However, In places where tipping is insulting waitstaff aren’t ridiculously underpaid like they are in the U.S.  The other habit that can draw the scoffs of onlookers at a restaurant outside the United States is asking for a ‘doggy bag’ or ‘to-go box’. In many countries, especially European ones the idea of saving a hot meal at a restaurant in order to reheat it and eat it at home is a disgusting prospect. Many dining cultures believe that the food is meant to be eaten exactly how it is prepared by the chef or cook at that moment, not to be consumed after the various sauces and meat juices congeal or have their perfect grilling or baking sullied by your microwave. A lot of the reason that Americans have developed this custom of bringing scraps home with them is due to portion sizes being generally much larger in the States than elsewhere. This may be a result of capitalist consumers becoming obsessed with getting their money’s worth causing restaurants to have slowly battled to stuff people’s gullets.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UIVrbOuqO28/sddefault.jpg,0.006348886382977647,0.004182231383698776,1.5180619627416874,0.00555901828631095,0.010531117766676422,0.016090136052987373,2018-06-09,12:15:01,Saturday,5,11,65,10,35,58,535,1,73,0,0,10,0,5,9,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.652061745946423,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'dining table': 1, 'bowl': 1, 'spoon': 1}",3

After the Parkland shooting in Florida which left 17 dead, there has been renewed scrutiny over gun laws in the United States, with many pushing for stricter control.

""These gun regulations are bogus,"" said one N.R.A member. “The problem is it's a cultural problem. How does that get solved? Values have to be reinstilled.""

“I'm saying that there's certain guns that we shouldn't have,” another panelist said, adding that mental evaluations were essential.

Almost all panelists agreed on expanding background checks, while one maintained that those are no guarantee against a possible future attack. “You don’t know if somebody is mentally unstable until they do something,” he said.

Remote, safe, smooth operation of robot enabled through new, advanced Torque Servo Module and Master Maneuvering System

Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) today revealed T-HR3, the company's third generation humanoid robot. Toyota's latest robotics platform, designed and developed by Toyota's Partner Robot Division, will explore new technologies for safely managing physical interactions between robots and their surroundings, as well as a new remote maneuvering system that mirrors user movements to the robot.

T-HR3 reflects Toyota's broad-based exploration of how advanced technologies can help to meet people's unique mobility needs. T-HR3 represents an evolution from previous generation instrument-playing humanoid robots, which were created to test the precise positioning of joints and pre-programmed movements, to a platform with capabilities that can safely assist humans in a variety of settings, such as the home, medical facilities, construction sites, disaster-stricken areas and even outer space.

""The Partner Robot team members are committed to using the technology in T-HR3 to develop friendly and helpful robots that coexist with humans and assist them in their daily lives. Looking ahead, the core technologies developed for this platform will help inform and advance future development of robots to provide ever-better mobility for all,"" said Akifumi Tamaoki, General Manager, Partner Robot Division.

T-HR3 is controlled from a Master Maneuvering System that allows the entire body of the robot to be operated instinctively with wearable controls that map hand, arm and foot movements to the robot, and a head-mounted display that allows the user to see from the robot's perspective. The system's master arms give the operator full range of motion of the robot's corresponding joints and the master foot allows the operator to walk in place in the chair to move the robot forward or laterally. The Self-interference Prevention Technology embedded in T-HR3 operates automatically to ensure the robot and user do not disrupt each other's movements.

Onboard T-HR3 and the Master Maneuvering System, motors, reduction gears and torque sensors (collectively called Torque Servo Modules) are connected to each joint. These modules communicate the operator's movements directly to T-HR3's 29 body parts and the Master Maneuvering System's 16 master control systems for a smooth, synchronized user experience. The Torque Servo Module has been developed in collaboration with Tamagawa Seiki Co., Ltd. and NIDEC COPAL ELECTRONICS CORP. This technology advances Toyota's research into safe robotics by measuring the force exerted by and on T-HR3 as it interacts with its environment and then conveying that information to the operator using force feedback.

The Torque Servo Module enables T-HR3's core capabilities: Flexible Joint Control, to control the force of contact the robot makes with any individuals or objects in its surrounding environment; Whole-body Coordination and Balance Control, to maintain the robot's balance if it collides with objects in its environment; and Real Remote Maneuvering, to give users seamless and intuitive control over the robot. These functions have broad implications for future robotics research and development, especially for robots that operate in environments where they must safely and precisely interact with their surroundings.

Since the 1980s, Toyota has been developing industrial robots to enhance its manufacturing processes. Partner Robot has utilized the insights from that experience and built on Toyota's expertise in automotive technologies to develop new mobility solutions that support doctors, caregivers and patients, the elderly, and people with disabilities.

T-HR3 will be featured at the upcoming International Robot Exhibition 2017 at Tokyo Big Sight from November 29 through December 2.

Several times, I have run into the same homeless person while traveling. It's always great to see a familiar face but also at the same time so very heartbreaking knowing that they have been homeless for that amount of time. It's also very concerning that homeless services has not been able to get that person off the streets.

Today, Invisible People reached a milestone that I wished never would have ever happened. Twice before I have interviewed Arien while she was homeless on the streets of Hollywood. I can't believe Arien is still sleeping outside, but then again, Jossayln has been on the streets of Los Angeles for 16 years [https://youtu.be/ItBBLiXUuWU].

This is the video from the first time Arien and I met.
https://youtu.be/4cgoJl9Rn-w She talked candidly about the harassment woman go through on the streets. Today she talked about being raped on her third day of homelessness.

Last October I happened to run into Adrien again. Her video interview here https://youtu.be/eF9xBAHs2KA where she mentioned attempts to kill herself prompted the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) outreach team to go visit her. They helped her with clothes and hygiene products and placed Arien on a housing list, but there are tens of thousands of homeless people in Los Angeles and not even close to enough housing.

In this interview, Arien talks about being handcuffed by police for
putting her tent up too soon. Homeless people cannot pitch their tents until after 9pm but because it was cold, Arien started to set her tent up at 5pm and almost got arrested.

Arien is not homeless by choice. No one chooses the streets as a
lifestyle. She occasionally gets work as a security guard but when her employer finds out she is homeless they let her go.

According to the last point in time count homelessness in Los Angeles grew 23%. Arien is just one of tens of thousands of homeless people that are in need of help. Last year, Los Angeles voters said yes to raising taxes to help end homelessness but now the battle is to gain public support. If you live in Los Angeles, please email or share this video on social to every stakeholder and politician you know. If you live outside of Los Angeles,  you know people that live here. Share Arien's video with them. We must all work together to end homelessness in Los Angeles.

Here is Arien's GoFundMe page:  https://www.gofundme.com/HumblyHomelessArien

About Invisible People: 

Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they’re on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can’t ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation’s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UJSfQaY1Cyw/sddefault.jpg,0.016011011413462492,0.0005124154317454762,31.246153846153845,0.0072069259646417565,0.01652342684520797,0.02373035280984973,2018-02-27,02:37:51,Tuesday,1,16,63,16,40,100,532,3,85,0,0,12,0,3,4,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.383848969862141,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Wild Love Lyrics:
Don’t know what to say to you now
Standing right in front of you
Don’t know how to fade in and out
Don’t know how to play it cool
Lose a little guard, let it down
We don’t have to think it through
We’ve got to let go

I want to give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I want to take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I want to go where the lights burn low and you’re only mine
I want to give you wild love

Tried to call you to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let’s leave the atmosphere, disappear
There’s always something left to lose

But I want to give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I want to take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I want to go where the lights burn low and you’re only mine
I want to give you wild love
(Wild, wild, wild...)

Let’s be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we’re breathless
Let’s be hopeful, don’t be broken
Let’s stay caught up in the moment 

I want to give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I want to take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I want to go where the lights burn low and you’re only mine
I want to give you wild love
Oh I said I want to give you wild love

Give you wild love, wild love, wild love, wild love

FAQs:

Q. Why isn’t ‘Off to the Vet’ available in full on YouTube?
A. ‘Off to the Vet’ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon’s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign please contact us at igg@simonscat.com

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.

Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?
A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: http://www.simonscat.com/Shop",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UL9LnPa-3A4/sddefault.jpg,0.012219474236108616,0.00033827911934342043,36.122460824143936,0.00032296526484035216,0.012557753355452035,0.012880718620292388,2018-01-29,17:37:29,Monday,0,8,66,8,54,40,548,4,134,1,0,3,10,0,3,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.2581860959840823,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

""Exactly 70 years ago today the United States under Harry Truman became the first nation to recognise the state of Israel,"" he said. ""Today we open the US embassy in Jerusalem. It's been a long time coming.""

He added: ""Today Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's government, and the home of the Israeli legislature and supreme court and its prime minister and president.

""Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other to determine its own capital. But for many years we failed to acknowledge the obvious.""

Mr Trump said he had accomplished the relocation ""many many years ahead of schedule"", and the US would ""always be a great friend to Israel and a partner in the cause of freedom and peace"".

The ceremony in Jerusalem began with the US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, officially declaring the new embassy open.

""Today, we open the United States embassy in Jerusalem, Israel,"" he said. ""Again the US leads the way as the first nation to do so.""

He credited Mr Trump's ""courage and moral clarity"" for the embassy move, adding: ""We owe an enormous and eternal debt of gratitude.""

You know what to say on my way out
Hit me with the ""Hey, been a while,""
Now I'm going straight through the fire, fire
(I don't even know why though)

Get me on a wave then you fade out
Hit me with the ‘life got me tired’
I should get away from you, I know, I know
(I don't even know why though)

High hopes, I fall for the cycle
High low, I'm on on a spiral
Love me, wide open then leave me idle
(I don't even know why though)

I just want to put my weight on ya
Switch it, smoke it, Imma sway on ya
Know I shouldn't, Imma wait on ya
(I don't even know why though)

I just want to put my weight on ya
Switch it, smoke it, Imma sway on ya
Know I shouldn't, Imma wait on ya
(I don't even know why though)

Maybe it's the love that you show me
Make my body feel like it's holy
Feel too good to stay hurt too much to leave
You're just what I need
(I don't even know why though)

High hopes, I fall for the cycle
High low, I'm on on a spiral
Love me, wide open then leave me idle
(I don’t even know why though)

I just want to put my weight on ya
Switch it, smoke it, Imma sway on ya
Know I shouldn't, Imma wait on ya

Harper’s Bazaar recently got Cara to interview Kendall to get the supermodel and reality star to reveal the naked truth about her life, and it’s giving us a more intimate insight to Kendall’s life than ever before. 

When it comes to defending supermodels such as herself today, Kendall told Cara QUOTE, “We don’t work any less hard than the ’90s models did when they were young” adding QUOTE, “I’ve actually talked about it with a couple of women, like Cindy Crawford, who have been doing this for a long time. A lot of people are like, ‘Oh, it’s so much easier now because you have Instagram. You don’t even need an agency anymore.’ But that’s just not true”. Kendall went on to explain that just like those 90s supermodels, she had to go on plenty of castings and meet with tons of photographers when she was getting started in the industry, in addition to having to work 12 to even 24 hour days to keep her career going strong.

On the topic of social media, Kendall admitted that she’s been hanging back when it comes to checking her feeds. She explained to Cara QUOTE, “Lately I’ve just tried to stay off it [social media], and I definitely don’t look at comments...I think Instagram is still a fun place for the most part. I like going on and seeing what people are up to, but I mostly follow stupid accounts with pictures of puppies and little baby animals and people saving animals. Forget about Twitter, which is so not fun these days. It just makes me sad.” 

One topic that came up was the idea of motherhood. While Cara didn’t pry Kendall about Khloe’s, Kim’s, or even Kylie’s current pregnancies, she did ask the 22-year-old about what kind of mother she’d want to be, asking Kendall if she’d let her kids get into the modeling world, and if she’d let them use social media. Kendall told Cara QUOTE, “I think I’ll definitely put an age limit on it and try to keep them away from it as much as possible. I always loved being able to play in my yard with my animals, and my dog, and my friends. It’s going to be interesting to see what the world is like when I do have kids. But I definitely don’t plan on having them anytime soon.”

Both ladies agreed that now is a very scary time to be bringing kids into the world, but then Cara suggested they have kids at the same time so that they can look after one another, which is just the cutest thing we’ve heard in a very long time. 

Cara rounded out the interview by asking Kendall where she hopes to be in 22 years, to which Kendall gave the lovely reply QUOTE, “I hope to have a family, and I hope to be in love. I just want light and happiness and love.” I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that her answer wasn’t “I hope to be on season 45 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians”.

Alright guys, now I wanna know what you think of Kendall’s interview with Cara? Which of her answers surprised you the most, and who would you wanna see interview her next?

With all of time and space to hide them in, it's no wonder the ""Doctor Who"" writers often leave us an Easter Egg or two. For this list, we're counting down the coolest and cleverest hidden gags, trivia tidbits and out of this world Easter eggs - including some that you may have missed - from the fan favourite BBC sci-fi series, ""Doctor Who"". From Queens of England to the Doctor's parents, with some ""Star Wars"" references to contend with too, there's plenty to go around. Geronimo!

Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in The Post, a thrilling drama about the unlikely partnership between The Washington Post's Katharine Graham (Streep), the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), as they race to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spanned three decades and four U.S. Presidents. The two must overcome their differences as they risk their careers - and their very freedom - to help bring long-buried truths to light. The Post marks the first time Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated on a project. In addition to directing, Spielberg produces along with Amy Pascal and Kristie Macosko Krieger. The script was written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the film features an acclaimed ensemble cast including Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods.

Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who may end up in charge, is every bit as nasty as his ex-boss, and the economic turmoil that the country is in will not be easily fixed.

President Robert Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980. At first he was lionised as the man who ended white minority rule. Then he sent his special forces to slaughter the Ndebele, an ethnic group that didn’t support him.  

His 37-year reign has been marred by economic free fall, land seizures and violence against anyone who spoke up against the regime.

But the military has staged a coup and forced him from power. These were the scenes in Harare the day the tanks rolled in. Zimbabweans hope that with the tyrant gone, their lives will improve. But will they?
 
The coup comes after months of political unrest, sparked by speculation that Mr Mugabe was planning to hand the presidency to his young wife, Grace, like a family heirloom.

Grace Mugabe, who once allegedly spent £1 million in Harrods in a single visit, earning her nickname Gucci Grace, has maneuvered to succeed her husband in recent years.

At her behest, the 93-year-old president sacked Emmerson Mnangagwa, his vice-president and presumed successor. Mr Mnangagwa fled the country, but now he’s back, with the army behind him.

Known as ‘the crocodile’, because he bides his time before biting, he was Mr Mugabe’s henchman when Grace was still a child, and is every bit as ruthless. He has helped to rig elections to keep Mr Mugabe in power. He also encouraged the violent takeovers of white-owned farms, destroying the country’s largest industry. This caused economic chaos. The government printed money to pay its bills, leading to hyperinflation. 

Silvanos Mudzvova is an activist whose one-man plays depict the corruption that has blighted the country. 

Mr Mudzova managed to escape the country, but that night is the last time he saw his wife and children. He is now in exile in Britain and paints a bleak picture of what living in Zimbabwe is like.

The Mugabes have been sidelined. But the ruling party, Zanu PF, who are just as much to blame for Zimbabwe’s plight, remain firmly in charge. 

Zimbabwe could thrive if it were well-governed. Its best hope is for donors to insist on free and fair elections. Unfortunately, the opposition are disorganised. And the ruling party has never played fair. The danger is that the coup will just replace one tyrant with another. 

The country is stuck in a deep ditch, into which Robert Mugabe drove it. Getting out will not be easy.

LYRICS:
How, how could we forget about you
the summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood
Of all the iterations yeah your the sickest dude
Fighting cow, how could we forget about you 

Say you don’t hate me for nothing 
Hate me for falling out of reach
Hate me for something 
Never knew that you could be so lonely, lonely
Running out of feelings so pretend you can be lonely, lonely
Stuck in your mind

Can’t let it go
What hurts you the most 
Is I wasn’t there to beg you 
“Baby don’t go” 
Put on show 

Light it up
Light it up 

No, it’s not a phase 
It’s the way that she combs my hair
Never wake 
Never wake from this coma

Light it up for us 
Show me the way growing 
Your catharsis is beautiful 
I wish i could be you 

Show up at the ball wit yo doo doo faced babe 
The robot with human hair is dead but gets laid 
That’s why he’s got all these kids on the way 
His son’s a girl named baby swirl that loves to swang his blade

Brighter 
How I wish I could touch you feel you breathe you be just like you",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UOvBPG0RCfA/sddefault.jpg,0.010218814120957754,0.0003086885045836654,33.103967168262656,0.0008002253299398713,0.010527502625541418,0.01132772795548129,2018-05-04,03:57:16,Friday,4,7,15,6,14,32,102,1,25,0,0,6,0,1,1,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.421678030415434,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end.

Fire ants are so unpreditcable! A major catastrophe happened within the Selva de Fuego, our South American biotope paludarium, home to our massive colony of fire ants and aquatic creatures. A decision and action by the Fire Nation Ant necessitated me to make a major installment to their home. Watch as I build an incredible waterfall and whirlpool to solve our issues! Ant love forever!

Letra:

Te Voy a Amar
 
Esta mañana dijo mi ventana que te vio pasar 
Siempre supiste que algo te faltaba y hoy vuelvo a soñar
Ya no me importa si una vez peleamos
Si algún día te fuiste, si te vi llorar
Yo te juré que si algún día regresabas no te iba a soltar.
 
Cómo olvidar que contigo aprendí 
Cómo soñar mi vida junto a ti
Te veo llegar para quedarte aquí
Y puedo jurar que yo ya lo entendí 
 
Coro: 
Te voy a amar, hoy tengo lo que me faltaba
Te voy a dar el tiempo que nunca te daba
Vas a volar porque contigo tengo todo 
Y sin tu amor no tengo nada 
Te voy a amar 
Te voy a amar 
 
Recuerda el día, recuerda tus sueños
Cuando éramos uno, cuando no importabas
Éramos pequeños, tú me dabas besos yo, canciones 
No importa que llores, voy a cantarte toda mi vida 
Hasta que tú me perdones 
Si fue mi culpa no te digo que no, pero se quiere lo que se pierde y
Perderte eso hizo crecer el amor 
Te amo y entre tus ojos puedo ver que tú me amas 
Yo contigo tengo todo y sin tu amor no tengo nada
 
Cómo olvidar que contigo aprendí 
Cómo soñar mi vida junto a ti
Te veo llegar para quedarte aquí
Y puedo jurar que yo ya lo entendí 
 
Coro: 
Te voy a amar, hoy tengo lo que me faltaba
Te voy a dar el tiempo que nunca te daba
Vas a volar porque contigo tengo todo 
Y sin tu amor no tengo nada 
Te voy a amar 
 
Porque por tonto me quedé esperando una llamada
Y sin tu amor yo no soy nada.
Siempre busqué mil cosas y eras tú la que faltaba
Hoy sobran las razones, vente a vivir a mis canciones
Te voy a amar
 
Coro: 
Te voy a amar, hoy tengo lo que me faltaba
Te voy a dar el tiempo que nunca te daba
Vas a volar porque contigo tengo todo 
Y sin tu amor no tengo nada 
Te voy a amar 
Te voy a amar

The Inner Space Center is the official live streaming partner of the Okeanos Explorer. Using cutting-edge equipment, the ISC transcodes and distributes all three simultaneous live streams to the Internet and participating scientists.

Note: During Okeanos Explorer live dives, you may also hear communications between those on the bridge (where the captain is driving the ship) and navigators helping direct ROV pilots. Scientists will be on the left channel of audio and ROV/navigation will be on the right channel.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Practice Notes 35

I had the great pleasure of inviting a very special guest onto this Practice Notes video. I wanted to find someone that could improvise (in the jazz idiom) on the Chopin Nocturne in E-Flat Major.  His name is Mario Romano and he is one of my close friends and mentors, and a very accomplished musician.  I think his musical mind is quite genius and although it took some convincing for him to play in front of the camera, we finally did it.

*Please note that some of the labeling/analysis bits with text is not so accurate... they just represent how I was trying to understanding it while editing the footage.  Also, the full track was over half an hour long and Mr. Mario requested that I do not post all of it publicly.  Show him some love in the comments and I will try to bring him back for another one :)

Hope you enjoy!

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Travis -  Read an article that said they had a test screening of Aquaman and the people who saw couldn’t outright say what they thought but a third party said it was an overall positive reaction. Why is Warner Bros sitting on the movie for almost another year.  I understand they don’t want to release it near IW, but wouldn’t they want to release it sooner than December, especially if they’re close to being done with the movie?

Emily DeWitt - I’m really excited for Jurassic World 2 since I loved the first one. Not as much as the original but I still had a great time. They’re saying they just set a release date for Jurassic World 3 on June 11, 2021. That’s great, but why announce a release date now? Shouldn’t they wait to see how Fallen Kingdom does first? Bring on the filthy!

Josh Johnson - Josh J: hey John thanks for doing all you do! I work at a Cinemark theaters and on the 22nd we are enforcing our big bags not allowed  policy to guests entering our theaters, how do you feel about this? Do you feel this was always bound to occur?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USSfSVpuck4/hqdefault.jpg,0.029770588857173062,0.0017337984987842267,17.170731707317074,0.008986150755893858,0.031504387355957286,0.040490538111851146,2018-02-22,16:45:08,Thursday,3,12,17,12,17,74,147,2,34,0,0,10,13,1,0,5.0,8.0,"['THE JOHN Pee', '', 'URL', 'ae', '', 'FIRST REACTIONS -']","['THE', 'JOHN', 'Pee', 'URL', 'ae', 'FIRST', 'REACTIONS', '-']",True,"['the', 'john', 'pee', 'url', 'ae', 'first', 'reaction', '-']",8,8,29,1,0,0,1,6.074174736600576,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

i'm currently back home in texas for spring break ! hanging out with my dearest friends. my life has changed so much since when i moved about about a half year ago. los angeles feel much more like home, texas feels like a good warm memory. i love being in texas though, everyone is so sweet. i sneezed and the entire cafe i was sitting in blessed me. i almost started crying it made me feel so comforted, la just ain't like that! but i love la too. haha.

working a lot lately on music. uploading once a week instead of twice in order to really get the work done on the ep. also been working on lots of mnew merch stuff for y'all, i wanna make sure i do it right and well. i hate half-assing stuff. either do it well or don't do it at all! that's a   m o t t o !

anywho, i'll see you in a week!

much love,

What's better, a supercharger or a turbocharger? Well, while they both do a wonderful job of increasing and engine's horsepower, they go about it in quite different ways. The turbocharger relies on exhaust gas pressure to spool up a turbine to deliver more air to the engine. A supercharger on the other hand is driven by an engine belt, which rotates a compressor feeding the engine fresh air. 

While ultimately both will result in more power, there are advantages to each, such as throttle characteristics, efficiency, torque curve characteristics, engine reliability, and packaging. In this video we'll discuss the pros and cons of running a supercharger or a turbocharger on your car.

Lyrics

I be myself I aint frontin na na nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself I aint frontin na na nah

I don't have to smile for you
I don't have to move or you
I don't have to dance monkey dance monkey dance for you
See I wont help you understand
I don't need no helping hand

These aren't tears this is the ocean
These aren't fears this is devotion

I owe you nothing
I be myself I aint frontin na na nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself I aint frontin na na nah

I don't have to walk for you
I don't have to talk to you
See I’m not on display, never was, never will ever be for you

I wont help you understand
I don't need no helping hand

These aren't tears this is the ocean
These aren't fears this is devotion

Why you always have to try me?
Thinking I'm gon follow blindly saying oh let me down easy, baby let me drown easy

Surprisingly, Ak gave Drake a complete L against Pusha. Later, Akademiks and Wayno share their thoughts on the Chief Keef and Tekashi 69 beef and give some advice so the situation doesn't turn to violence going forward. The show wraps with Wayno, Nadeska, and Akademiks getting some jokes off about Lil Uzi Vert pulling up on Rich the Kid in Philly over the weekend.

The 2018 Land Rover Defender Works V8 pays homage to the early high-powered engines in both the Series III Stage 1 V8 from 1979 and subsequent Defenders including the 50th Anniversary Edition, which are highly sought after by enthusiasts and collectors today.

Defender Works V8 is the most powerful and fastest version that Land Rover has ever created. The 5.0-litre naturally-aspirated petrol V8 powertrain produces 405 horsepower and 515 Nm of torque (the standard Defender delivered 122 HP and 360 Nm). The Defender Works V8 will accelerate from 0-60mph (0-96 kph) in 5.6sec, while top speed is increased to 106mph (170 kph).

The V8 powertrain will be fitted to 150 specially-selected and re-engineered Defenders for the 70th Edition, complemented by an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission with sport mode, uprated brakes and handling kit (springs, dampers and anti-roll bars), plus exclusive 18-inch diamond-turned Sawtooth alloy wheels and 265/65 R18 all-terrain tyres.

Both 90 and 110 wheelbase Defender Works V8 derivatives will be available to purchase direct from Land Rover Classic, with prices starting from £150,000 for a 90 in the UK.

IN THE PAPERS - Monday, May 28: For once, the sports pages are kind, urging the public to go easy on Loris Karius, the unfortunate Liverpool goalkeeper who cost his side the Champions League final. Also, we look at elections in Colombia and post-election chaos in Italy. The German press rejoices after an anti-Merkel march led by the far-right AfD party is dwarfed by a counter-protest. Finally, an undocumented Malian man becomes a French hero after scaling a building to save a child.

Lyrics
VERSE 1
I am walking down that road
Where did all the flowers go?
They say we’re supposed to grow
Learning from the highs and lows
 
All eyes lying on me oh,
Begging me to play the role
‘Cause I’m gonna get it right
I’m gonna get it right
 
CHORUS
They can try to hold me down but I am
I’m gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I’m gonna get it right
 
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down but I am
I’m gonna get it right
 
VERSE 2
Switchin lanes, four doors feelin like Jeezy 
Undercover sweater, Balmain, boots Yeezy
Summer feelin winter feelin rappin like I’m Weezy Lord forgive me ain’t no prayin when it the hit fan Jesus
Cancun chillin by the pool I can feel it
Almost hit my goal but I still hit loose women
Dueces up, ain’t nobody reaching yoouu baby
Ain’t nobody stoppin you baby
 
CHORUS
They can try to hold me down but I am
I’m gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I’m gonna get it right
 
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down but I am
I’m gonna get it right
 
OUTRO
I’m gonna get it right
I’m gonna get it right

This episode of Space Time Journal Club looks at the paper:

A density cusp of quiescent X-ray binaries in the central parsec of the Galaxy
by Hailey, Mori, Bauer, Berkowitz, Hong & Hord (2018)
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25029

The core of our galaxy is a wild place. The stars are so densely packed that the night sky would be 500 times brighter. A supermassive black hole, 4 million times the mass of our Sun lurks in the center. It flings nearby stars into extreme slingshot orbits. It consumes anything that gets too close is consumed, burping a blast of X-rays.  We know these things because we see them from our comfortable vantage point 28,000 light years out in the galactic disk. But  there’s one particularly terrible feature of the core of our galaxy that, until now, has only been has only be hypothesized: The central few light years of the Milky Way is thought to contain a vast swarm of smaller black holes that have rained in from the surrounding galaxy.

Travis Scott, 25, has certainly hushed all of those claims that he won’t be a present father. Not only was he extremely supportive throughout Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy, but we’ve just learned that he’s also helping out around the kitchen! Yes, you read that correctly. “Travis is enamored with being a new dad, and it’s reflecting in his everyday actions — not only in recent days, but he’s become a lot more focused on being a provider in the home to Kylie and Stormi [Webster]. Travis has been stealing little cooking tips from Kylie’s chef that he can take and utilize whenever Kylie is hungry, and he can whip up something delicious for her,” a source close to Travis tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY!  After only being a dad for a little over a week, Travis is certainly up for Father of The Year Award.

Die neue DJI Mavic Air im Praxistest. Im Unboxing zeigen wir euch, was bei der neuen Superdrohne alles mit dabei ist und was der Quadrocopter kann. 
Wir zeigen euch in diesem ersten Video die ersten Luftaufnahmen, Bilder und Videos, die wir mit der 4K-Kameradrohne aufgenommen haben. Natürlich in deutsch!
In weiteren Videos zeigen wir euch dann noch den direkten Vergleich zur DJI Phantom 4 Pro und DJI Mavic Pro / Platinum sowie der DJI Spark.
In späteren Video gibt es dann auch noch Details zu den einzelnen Funktionen und Flugmodi wie TapFly 2.0, Active Track, Gesture Capture und vieles mehr.

Especially Teslas.

In this episode we discuss the perils of acquiring a salvaged Tesla, more specifically flooded ones. How will you get the money? How will you get the car? How are you going to bid? The flooded S40 in the video keeps getting bounced around between $23,000 and $25,000.

Next week I will contradict myself by telling you why you SHOULD buy a salvaged Tesla! Stay tuned!

If you do get a salvaged Tesla and need parts, checkout the Tesla Parts Buy Sell Trade group on facebook!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UZEU5czmucI/sddefault.jpg,0.00994356409369195,0.0005347275163606459,18.595572117492328,-1.1721339683486321e-07,0.010478291610052596,0.010478174396655762,2017-11-23,07:25:26,Thursday,3,4,38,3,33,21,334,0,79,0,1,4,14,0,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.98957487337088,3,"['happy', 'neutral', 'sad']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.
