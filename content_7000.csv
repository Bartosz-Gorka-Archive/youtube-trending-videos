Products Used:
Nair Face Cream | Mine is from Target and it was $3.99

-- The redness usually goes away in about 10 minutes.
-- I've never had any reactions to it in the 6 months I've been using it.
-- I Nair my face usually once a week
-- After I remove the product from my face I wash my face with cold water only and pat dry...which I did immediately after I finished filming this. 

The End.

Olivia, Lucas and a group of their college friends travel to Mexico for one last getaway before graduation. While there, a stranger convinces one of the students to play a seemingly harmless game of truth or dare with the others. Once the game starts, it awakens something evil -- a demon which forces the friends to share dark secrets and confront their deepest fears. The rules are simple but wicked -- tell the truth or die, do the dare or die, and if you stop playing, you die.

MAIN TOPICS

PATREON Supporter Mr. Moody - I am hearing reports that Alicia Vikander is out as Lara Croft? Is there any truth do it? I thought she did a great job with a above average film! What are your thoughts sir and bring on the filthy.

Jason Middlemen - Hey John, I’m facing a crisis! On April 13th 2 movies I’m really excited to see open up. Borg vs McEnroe and Rampage. Which one should I be seeing on opening day first? Love your show and bring on the filthy!

Dan Sokolov - There have been rumours that Meryl Streep could possibly replace CF as Leia in E9. This got me thinking - though I think recasting is fine, is it a good idea to get someone this famous for such an iconic role? Will Streep's fame distract us from Leia character?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/89iF2LmfD-4/hqdefault.jpg,0.03077287653610481,0.004265547242628389,7.2142857142857135,0.011781035241545076,0.0350384237787332,0.046819459020278266,2018-03-30,16:23:02,Friday,4,19,22,18,22,94,182,3,40,0,0,18,22,6,0,4.0,7.0,"['=', 'o', 'ies', 'nA', '<=', 'wi', 'ou', '=', '=<', 'oo', '=', '=', 'ao', '=', 'bu', '=', '', 'ale', 'site Le en', 'ati fat aa']","['=', 'o', 'ies', 'nA', '<=', 'wi', 'ou', '=', '=<', 'oo', '=', '=', 'ao', '=', 'bu', '=', 'ale', 'site', 'Le', 'en', 'ati', 'fat', 'aa']",True,"['=', 'o', 'i', 'nA', '<', '=', 'wi', 'ou', '=', '=', '<', 'oo', '=', '=', 'ao', '=', 'bu', '=', 'ale', 'site', 'Le', 'en', 'ati', 'fat', 'aa']",25,17,43,10,0,1,2,6.284460820403591,3,"['happy', 'angry', 'happy']",1,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

  Here is the latter half of the Disney World trip I took, now over a month ago. Thank you for watching, and reading this, I appreciate everything endlessly. Being able to tell stories or share my memories with you is a blessing, and so many things wouldn’t be if not for this. I hope you can take a piece of happiness that I am sending to you.
My spring term so far has been great, I can’t wait to catch up in terms of present-day school vlogs, or just updates in general. After the break, returning back to a new term in school was really like picking it back up running with no time to pause. (thank goodness for the weekend). I am learning so much, and despite the long hours of laborious work I know how lucky I am to have this education.
Wherever you may be, I hope you are well, and that you continue to take care of yourself. We have those we love so much, but it is above all important to remember to nurture our own bodies and spirits so that we can live presently, the best we can, alongside those we love most.

I will see you soon,
Annabelle

For the past couple of years, the company has turned away from what made it great to embrace ideas that aren't popular with mainstream audiences. With the failure that was Marvel Legacy, Alex Alonso was removed as Editor-in-Chief and replaced by C.B. Cebulski.

In this video, I talk about why this changing of the guard has me excited. The end of the Alonso era signals a fresh start for the once-proud comic book publisher. I believe that starting later this year, we'll see Marvel Comics become the dominant force it once was.

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y.

Warner Bros and DC are in the early stages of another Batman Universe spinoff movie, this one telling the origin story of the signature villain The Joker. The studio has set The Hangover‘s Todd Phillips to co-write a script with 8 Mile scribe Scott Silver. Phillips will direct the movie, and Martin Scorsese will produce it with Phillips. This will be the first film under a new banner that has yet to be named in which WB can expand the canon of DC properties and create unique storylines with different actors playing the iconic characters.

I’m told that the intention is to make an origin story that isn’t part of any other iteration. The Joker has memorably been part of two Batman movies in the form of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, and was most recently played by Jared Leto in the first Suicide Squad film. He will reprise in the Suicide Squad sequel and the Harley Quinn spinoff, but this new film will launch the character with a different actor, possibly younger.

An intriguing part is the setting. The intention is to make a gritty and grounded hard-boiled crime film set in early-’80s Gotham City that isn’t meant to feel like a DC movie as much as one of Scorsese’s films from that era, like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or The King Of Comedy. I’m told that Phillips and Silver are writing already, but there is nothing firm on where this will fit into the DC schedule.

Joaquin Phoenix may soon have to don a green wig and white face-paint to play Batman's greatest adversary. The American actor is reportedly in talks to star in a new film about the Joker, produced by Oscar-winner Martin Scorsese.

Although the 42-year-old's casting has not yet been confirmed, Variety reports that Phoenix has been approached, and has agreed to play the role.

Last year, it was reported that producers hoped for the as-yet-untitled film to be ""a gritty and grounded hard-boiled crime film set in early-Eighties Gotham City"", with a similar tone to Scorsese's most acclaimed Eighties movies, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.

Further details about Todd Phillips and Martin Scorsese’s upcoming origin movie about The Joker have emerged, with the film set to reportedly depict the villain as a failed stand-up comic.

Phillips will direct the new DC and Warner Bros.-made film, with Scorsese acting as an executive producer. Joaquin Phoenix is the current favourite to play the titular villain, although Leonardo DiCaprio has also been linked to the famous role, as well as Willem Dafoe, many fans have suggested him as a possible actor to one day step into the iconic purple suit of The Joker.

A new report from The Wrap has apparently shed light on some more details surrounding the forthcoming film, with Phillips set to depict Batman’s enemy as a failed 1980s stand-up comic “who becomes the clown prince of crime after bombing with audiences”.

This take on The Joker has origins in the 1988 DC graphic novel The Killing Joke, which was written by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland.

As residents of the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Puerto Ricans have US passports, can travel freely throughout the country and can serve in the military. But that doesn’t mean the US citizens who live in Puerto Rico get the same rights and benefits as US citizens stateside.

Watch the video above to understand how Puerto Rico became a US commonwealth, the tangled relationship that developed, and how it all affects prosperity and development on the island today.

Lyrics

I've been working on myself and on my patience
But sometimes that shit don't come easy
And I see you've been tryin your best to give me explanations
But words don't really cut it lately

Remember when our love was precious
We thought what we had was the best , yeah
Now every answer's a question
Like every night is one of us is getting agressive
The other one's acting possessive
Guess it's the way that we do shit now

You and me we never say we're sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together
We don't do no, we don't do no conversations
We don't talk the way we used to
You act like we're all good sometimes, you know I hate it
'Cause it's so obvious it ain't true

Remember when our love was precious
We thought what we had was the best yet
Now every answer's a question
Like every night is one of us is getting agressive
The other one's acting possessive
Guess it's the way that we do shit now

You and me we never say we sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good, good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe we're crazy
No one loves me better
Than you, you, you, you

You and me we never say we sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good, good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8EWwm93ek_4/sddefault.jpg,0.01498199555515996,0.00015751267907164454,95.11612426035505,8.94746579341886e-05,0.015139508234231606,0.015228982892165796,2018-01-17,15:16:44,Wednesday,2,7,67,7,63,43,555,3,125,1,2,5,10,0,3,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.7130202626730915,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

I enjoyed Justice League for what it was.  I mean, it didn't blow me away or anything,  but I don't think it was AS BAD as a lot of people were saying.

But, at the same time, it wasn't that good either.  

These are my opinions as to why that is.

He answered that these films should NOT be considered for Oscars. He stated, “I don’t believe that films that are just given token qualifications, in a couple of theaters for less than a week, should qualify for the Academy Award nominations….in fact, once you commit to a television format, you’re a TV movie.” He went on to say that Netflix movies “deserve an Emmy, but not an Oscar.” Very strong words from one of the filmmakers who has always been on the forefront of technology and innovative filmmaking techniques. Is he wrong? Is he out of step with the times? Or is he holding firm to a tradition that is essential for making sure that a certain quality of film is in consideration for Academy Awards?

John Rocha and Dorian Parks sit down to talk about Spielberg’s comments and if they ring true for them or if they disagree with the decorated filmmaker. It’s certainly a divisive issue and one that merits much discussion and Rocha and Dorian offer some background and examples to defend their positions.

Lyrics

Wandering the streets all through the night,
Searching for the one to make me right.
Wondering if she's the shade of you,
And If so, should I try to see it through.

Darling, I got my trust issues.
Warning, you stay away.
If we meet at the rendezvous,
take me away, Sunray

Time and toys,
May fill my heart with joy,
I'll know peace when I'm your lover boy.

I'll be your new school soul.
Silver and gold.
New desire.
Friends on fire.
Call me 'lover boy'",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HnLRrQ3RS4/sddefault.jpg,0.01444212875560439,0.00029215317453498485,49.43341375150784,0.0002959768921992846,0.014734281930139375,0.01503025882233866,2018-03-15,13:00:46,Thursday,3,7,7,7,7,42,73,3,19,0,0,6,0,0,0,5.0,10.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.71018757898494,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Lyrics:
Today is the day I’ll learn that I believe in miracles
I can feel the world opening up, I think I broke the curse
No, I won’t grab you by the arm when you call
No one can give me what I want
Yeah, I know

Let’s get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time’s on our side
While our hearts stay young
Let’s think about it tomorrow

Daddy said he needed money
So he put her on the street “street”
She had just turned thirteen
Got a family to feed “feed”
Yeah we grew up in a hurry “that’s when she met me”
Daddy got a little worried “American dream”

C’mon, let’s go
We’ll think about it tomorrow
C’mon, let’s go
We’ll think about it tomorrow

Let’s get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time’s on our side
While our hearts stay young
Let’s think about it tomorrow
Let’s get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time’s on our side
While our hearts stay young
Let’s think about it tomorrow

Las horas se me hacen siglos aquí
Dame un beso que me dure una eternidad “c’mon let’s go”
Porque nunca voy a regresar, nunca “c’mon let’s go”
Te invito si quieres, y como un cometa en el cielo
Nos quemaremos juntos
Nos quemaremos juntos

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

Hamada will focus on Warners’ slate of upcoming films  based on superheroes and villains, as well as titles based on other characters and stories also licensed from DC. He will work closely with Geoff Johns, the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment who worked side-by-side with Berg, while also drawing resources from both Warners and New Line.

John Rocha sits down with Jay Washington to discuss this latest shakeup in the studio halls of DC and Warner Bros. They explore if this decision is too little too late to save the DCEU franchise. And discuss if his massive successes in the horror movie genre will excite the DC fanbase or promote skepticism that he’s right the man to right the ship.

It’s no secret that famous siblings Willow and Jaden Smith march to the beat of their own drums. The children of parents Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith have some interesting parenting philosophies that not everyone agrees with. From their views on punishments, to encouraging their kids to be themselves, we’ll let you know some of the strict rules their kids are expected to follow. Although some may disagree with their unorthodox methods, Will and Jada desperately want the best for their kids, and believe that is achieved by encouraging them to be themselves. Do you agree with their unusual parenting strategies, or do you think that they’ve gone too far despite their good intentions?

Voice shows a characters control of a scene. Depending on how they talk and when they talk, you can see the power dynamics between characters. Who's in control, and who's being dominated.

De skal nemlig åbne Christmas Crackers (eller jule-knallerter) - noget hverken Zac eller Zendaya har prøvet før!

THE GREATEST SHOWMAN er en original og nyskabende musical, som er inspireret af P.T. Barnums ekstraordinære liv, med Hugh Jackman i hovedrollen. Barnum voksede op under trange kår, men han var en meget kreativ og visionær mand. Kronen på værket i hans karriere var ”The Greatest Show on Earth”, der var en imponerende forestilling og en fejring af hans enestående fantasi og opfindsomhed, som endte med at begejstre publikum verden over.

The Greatest Showman er i biograferne den 25. december!

Legendary rapper R.A. The Rugged Man recently surprised his fans by delivering some awe-inspiring rhymes over an unexpected instrumental: Taylor Swift's chart-topping single, ""Look What You Made Me Do.""  As a true emcee, R.A. can rap to anything, and he proved it by torching Swift's pop anthem with the uncensored, ferocious lyricism that has made him an underground hip hop icon.

“Donald Glover premiered two new songs on Saturday Night Live this weekend, and while he was on stage, he also dropped a music video for one of the singles — ""This Is America.""

The video, choreographed by Sherrie Silver and directed by Hiro Murai, has a lot jammed into it for a four-minute video. It's an expertly packaged analysis of what's really happening in the United States. Here's what you might have missed:

Some Twitter users initially believed the man playing guitar at the beginning of the video was Tracy Martin — father of Trayvon Martin, the young boy who was killed by George Zimmerman in 2012. Turns out it's actually Calvin II, a musician based in Los Angeles. You can listen to more of his work @CalvinTheII.”

This time around we explore a genre of anime that I have a severe under-appreciation for: COMEDY & ROMANCE! Dominic comes by again to help challenge my knowledge of funny and romantic anime, deciding which ones actually exist and which ones are complete phonies that YOU wrote into us! But THIS time, the stakes are raised with a pie going into my face each time I'm stumped! All of you made this challenge incredibly tough AND enlightening!! Hope you enjoy!!

Thank you to Dominic for helping out with this video!! Your anime skills, accuracy of pie throwing, and lack of judgment on my drawings was very much appreciated!!!

The Wowmino is a fresh, multi-level adaptation of the traditional Domino structure. It provides an exciting new experience which is convenient and streamlined, enabling anyone and everyone to pick up the pieces and enjoy the game quickly while also offering more challenging design opportunities for pro-players who want to take the game to the next level.
Wowmino is the first 3D Domino system that allows users to design structures that move in every direction, turn corners, travel up and down ramps via columns that make multiple levels possible, and utilize turn stiles, launcher chutes, and balls for extra flare

This is just a prototype kit and a final product is not available to purchase yet.

I had the Wowminos for one weekend and I hope you like the projects that I made 😉

“Around the time Donald Trump took off from the Philippines aboard Air Force One at the end of his 12-day Asia tour, Stephen K. Bannon touched down at Tokyo International Airport. It was the evening of November 14, and the president’s former chief strategist flew to Japan to deliver a hard-edged anti-China speech at a conference for human-rights activists. “I’m not really a human-rights guy,” he told me as we boarded the plane in New York. “But this is a chance to talk to them about populism.”

A polite airline representative whisked Bannon and his entourage through the terminal. Tej Gill, a goateed ex-Navy SEAL security guard with tattoo-sleeved arms, stuck close by Bannon’s side. “I’ve had a couple assassination plots,” Bannon told me, “I got it from an intelligence source.” They were trailed by a short, barrel-chested ex-SEAL in a knit beanie cap, by a videographer named Dan Fleuette who co-wrote Bannon’s documentary Clinton Cash, and a redheaded body man, Bannon’s 26-year-old nephew, Sean. In moments we were escorted through a V.I.P. immigration lane and into an elevator that descends to an underground garage, where a motorcade awaited. Bannon climbed into the back seat of a black BMW 7 Series and sped off towards the Peninsula hotel to catch a few hours of sleep. The rest of the staff followed in a pair of minivans.

The next morning, Bannon was pacing in front of a packed auditorium in a squat building on the grounds of the Olympic Village built for the ‘64 Tokyo Summer Games. “I feel like I’m at a Trump rally!” he said, pointing out a young woman sporting a Make America Great Again hat. For the next hour, Bannon held court, microphone in hand. “The elites in our country have been under a very false premise that as China became more prosperous and economically developed that there would be an underlying increase in democracy,” he said. “What we found out over the last decade is the exact opposite has happened.” He speculated that dark unseen forces are at work. “The question has to be asked: Are the elites in the United States that stupid? Did people actually sit there year after year after year and not understand what was going on? Or was something else going on? Were these elites either bought off or did they just look the other way? That question is going to have to be answered.”

Are you guys excited to see Tom Hardy as Venom!!

""Venom"" is a 2018 movie made by Marvel Studios as a spinoff of the 2017 film Spider-Man: Homecoming. It is the first movie of MCU Phase 4. It serves as a prequel to Homecoming revealing Venom's origins. It adapts an episode from the 1994 Spider-Man animated series.

Tom Hardy, who was nominated for an Oscar for his work in The Revenant, is in final negotiations to star in Venom as Eddie Brock, while Ruben Fleischer, best known for directing Zombieland, is final negotiations to helm the movie project centering on one of Spider-Man’s signature villains. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. The project is one of Sony’s top priorities and the studio is not wasting time as the movie is set to open Oct. 5, 2018. Venom is to usher in a host of movies from Sony's Marvel and Spider-Man-based universe of characters (we could even see a Carnage movie, Tom Holland as the black symbiote Spider-Man or in the Iron Spider Suit we seen in Spider-Man Homecoming). 

Sony is rebooting its Marvel-based slate with this summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming and Venom is a key title in its slate. The studio is also developing a Silver Sable/Black Cat project among other characters from the Spider-Man stable.

Whether Marvel's vision will incorporate Sony's previously proposed spin-offs or try something new is unclear, but it's hard to deny that Spider-Man’s future with the studio is looking very bright indeed. Tom Holland in Spider-Man Homecoming was ""Spectacular"" and will hopefully make the studios secure future Spidey movies! We would love to see Marvel & Sony bring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back somehow as alternate Spider-Men in a huge Spider-Verse Movie crossover, perhaps even with Miles Morales (Donald Glover?) along side them.

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. 

While her song ""Devil Devil"" hit success, it wasn't until her anthem ""Quiet"" made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. 

With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8PId8tK5Dws/sddefault.jpg,0.022196143495943184,0.0007891062865467495,28.128205128205128,0.0005867713412783523,0.02298524978248993,0.023572021123768286,2018-01-19,05:03:43,Friday,4,9,34,9,30,44,245,3,46,1,0,7,0,4,7,4.0,6.0,['w'],['w'],True,['w'],1,1,1,0,0,0,0,4.465689320600424,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'cat': 1},1

Another was Brenda Spencer, a teen who shot several schoolchildren and killed two adults in 1979.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Q0aKPlhwa4/sddefault.jpg,0.013625178833246944,0.000578259870651813,23.56238003838771,0.001978958444092482,0.01420343870389876,0.016182397147991242,2018-04-04,20:25:45,Wednesday,2,9,31,9,30,61,271,0,58,0,0,8,0,2,1,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.501804142064523,5,"['sad', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,1,0,2,{'person': 5},5

I made these boxes out of reclaimed douglas fir with cherry wood splines.

I milled all the lumber from some larger pieces so I could be very selective of the grain in the wood that I would be using.  The boxes are a simple design, but by book matching the panels and using some really high-quality hardware, I was able to bring these to the next level.   I used a laser printer to print a reverse image onto standard paper and then used an iron to transfer to the pre-finished wood.  You can use a solvent to transfer the logo too, but this method gives a much crisper line.

I think everything I used is linked below but if not just leave a comment asking nicely and I will provide it.  A time stamp will help me know what you're talking about if you don't know the name of the tool

I firstly apologize that this is the first video of the new year you had to see from me, but I had too many things to say about this matter. Although Logan has taken the video down at the time of me writing this, I believe it's not an excuse to forgive what he did. He didn't take the video down because he ""learned his lesson"", he took it down as damage control for the amount of backlash he was receiving.
Again, this video is not just towards Logan, but to anybody who plans to visit any country/culture they are unfamiliar with. It's not difficult to educate yourself to better understand what you are about to set your foot into. And if you're someone with a lot of influence, it's especially important that you understand this. Don't spread the disrespect of another person, another culture and another country. Keep learning, stay respectful and be a good role model.
Suicide is never the answer, and is a topic that should be handled with extreme care. Please seek help if you ever have such thoughts.
I honestly don't care if you continue to support Logan after this controversy. But just know that I will never support anyone who has the guts to show such disrespect to any person or culture with an uneducated mindset.
Regular content will be back very soon. Thanks again everyone.

Love, Joey

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8SCLQIgLS3I/sddefault.jpg,0.013930351082305134,0.00045403466554671434,30.68125,0.0009131772210808297,0.014384385747851848,0.015297562968932678,2018-03-09,06:40:36,Friday,4,6,39,6,34,32,345,0,79,0,1,6,18,1,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.353146212687423,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'dining table': 1, 'chair': 1, 'wine glass': 1, 'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",6

It’s official! Disney announced that “Descendants 3” is happening! The teaser is out and it has the internet buzzing. OMG! We are going to find out who Mal’s dad is! Seriously, who is the smoky, glowing orb guy?  

If you’re like us, you watched the teaser like 100 times to try to find hidden clues and messages about “Descendants 3.” We noticed some pretty interesting details that you might have missed. You’re not going to believe what we discovered. It looks like Kenny Ortega is back to direct the film and choreograph the numbers. We are dying to know what Evie (Sofia Carson) will be wearing. Will Mal (Dove Cameron) and Ben (Mitchell Hope) stay together? And what’s happening with Carlos (Cameron Boyce) and Jay (Booboo Stewart)? And Maleficent! Is she still a lizard? Will all the villain kids find out who their absent parents are? So many questions! For now, we’ll just obsess over the teaser.

I absolutely LOVE Camila Cabello, I don't why it took me so long to listen to her stuff! Her new debut album is AMAZING!

I am also a fan of Fifth Harmony and a few of their songs BUT I thought their 2017 VMA performance was a bit unnecessary...what did you think?

Spread Happiness friends!!

The lightsaber is the Force made visible, sensible, concrete -- the mental transformed into the physical. What really makes the lightsaber special is that it’s the bridge between the Force that’s felt inwardly, and the Force that’s manifested in the outer world. The lightsaber is not just elegant and civilized  -- it’s inspirational, telling us that what we feel and believe can have a direct, visible mark on the world… if we understand how to access and control the Force.

15 Daredevils on Sky Walker Video That Will Scare You To Death
15 skywalker clips 
1. Climb to the stars of Moscow’s heights
In 2012 Russian adrenalin junkie Artyom Pirniyazov hauled his way to the pinnacle of the Kotelnicheskaya Building at 176 meters, completely ignoring any safety equipment . The crowning star of the skyscraper is one of seven similar buildings around Moscow known as 'Stalin’s Seven Sisters'.
2. 'Crazy Russians' on a Dubai skyscraper
Nineteen-year-old Alexander Remnev, known for scaling a number of Dubai's towering buildings, climbed several city skyscrapers, including the Princess Tower - the world's tallest residential building at 414 m. Along with his friends Remnev took vertigo-inducing snapshots of themselves and the city landscape and posted on his blog in March.
“We climbed all the high rise buildings in Dubai without safety equiptment” they said.
And of course, there is a heart-stopping video of the process.
3. Shanghai high ‘skywalkers’ use the force to scale world’s 2nd-tallest tower
Another mind-boggling climb, which a team of young men from Russia and Ukraine recently undertook, was in China. Self-styled ‘skywalkers’ Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov climbed the 121 stories of steel girders of the Shanghai Tower, filming the vertiginous ordeal.
4. Gut-wrenching video of British stunts sky-high
James Kingston posted breathtaking footage from first person views from a 76-meter Southhampton crane on his webpage in 2013. Not only did he climb the steel constructs, he also performed some jaw-dropping stunts.
“I didn't go up there to die. I went up there to live,” he wrote on his YouTube page.
He filmed his climb in a shocking video called 'Reach for the Star'.
5. Blonde Russian roof girl films herself in a head-spinning video
Russian girls also have a craze for this extreme urban sport. Student Maria Bezrukova filmed herself in 2012 walking along a narrow concrete beam of one of Moscow’s high-rise apartment blocks, devoid of safety equipment.
“When a person overcomes his fear he crosses the line that seemed to be impossible to cross he learns something new about himself,” she told RT.
6. Giddy selfie atop Brazil's 124ft-high Christ the Redeemer
Lee Thompson, 31, co-founder of a UK travel firm, climbed the iconic Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro taking head-spinning selfies and posting them on his blog in June this year.
“Looking at this selfie still makes my heart race and knees buckle!” he writes.
Equipped with two steeplejacks he and his colleague Oliver Harvey made the 25-minute climb filming it with Go Pro cameras.
7. Edinburgh daredevil scales antenna tower
Fly in the Sky YouTube user is asking the public to share his climbing experience of the antenna tower on Blackford Hill, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
8. Staying fit: pull-ups 150m off the ground
Here's a video of a Ukrainian kid doing pull-ups on a top of a 150 meter construction crane in Kiev. He leaps off the side, on to a crossbar, and does several pull-ups as those watching bite their nails. Mustang Wanted has laid out a vivid display of his daredevil skills throughout the world, in his media library.
9. Climbing Europe's tallest building in winter conditions
Another study by ‘Raskalov and Co’ in 2012, witnessed five skyscraper-scaling Russians challenge themselves to climb to the highest point of Moscow’s Mercury City Tower without a safety net while it was still under construction.
The aim was to touch the end of a rooftop construction crane that hovered at 370 meters above the cold ground.
At 339 meters, Mercury City Tower in Moscow recently stole the title of Europe's tallest building from London's Shard.
10. Nordic spirit takes on a crane challenge
Crane climbing in Norway also seems to be popular with YouTube user Slavik Mus displaying his skills laughing in the face of danger.
11. World's largest cable-stayed bridge is no obstacle for thrill seekers
Russian daredevils continue to reach new heights in all parts of the country. Two years ago, two Russian guys climbed a 350m high bridge crane in Vladivostok. The bridge to the Russky Island is the world's largest cable-stayed bridge, with a 1104-meter-long central span. The views of course are spectacular.
12.Spectacular views of LA
A POV crane climb in Los Angeles with James Kingston is yet another video that gained popularity in social media.
13.Can you hear the music 110m above terra firma?
Climbing on top of the 110-meter Elbe Philharmonic Hall in

After months and months of questions about our religion and Christian beliefs, we felt it time to properly answer them for you! We have nothing to hide and are so happy to share! This video is in NO WAY trying to convince anyone to become Mormon, and is in no way comparing our religion to any other. We are simply answering your questions, just like we do about other topics! It's fun, and I hope you watch to the end (it gets a bit emotional, ha!). We take our beliefs very seriously, they are incredibly special and sacred to us. We apologize in advance, but have decided to turn off the comments for this video. We want to protect ourselves and anyone one else who is watching, and we want to keep the vibe as loving and accepting as possible. So we ask that this video be introspective for anyone who watches, rather than leaving a comment. Thank you for understanding!

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

""Living It Up"" Lyrics:
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now ain’t life crazy?
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now don’t be lazy

Trench Town have a grandson 
Growing up to be somebody 
Gong to the Zilly
Yo mi flow phenomenally
I am the kind of thing that doesn’t happen normally 
I’m a one in a zillion
Yo Doggy if you want some
Good life finally
Perhaps change your night time hobby 
Come out of the old crime lobby
And benefit from your wisdom
Mi a gwan live it up life is better than great
Every other day mi voice a dozen dub plate
Put in our hustle we nuh sit down and wait
Tuff up unnu muscle now is never too late
Fi gwan celebrate inna rich people place
The little Rasta Man from Trench Town fly the gate 
With food inna plate and drinks inna crate
We sing till the neighbor dem wake

My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now ain’t life crazy?
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now don’t be lazy

Uptown Jamaica born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days 
Burning Babylon and dem dirty ways
While watching all the rich kids gone a stay
Uptown Jamaica born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days 
Big city life Kingston and Mo-Bay
And if you think mi sell out tell dem ain’t no way 
So... Live it up Trench Town to Rema
Riverton, South Side to Jungle
Sherlock, Garden, to Spangler’s,
Payne Land, Three Mile to Back-to,
Portmore, Seaview, Spanish Town,
Nine Mile, Browns Town to Flankers,
Falmouth, West Side, Orange Hill

My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now ain’t life crazy?
My daddy made it out!
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams, believe you me 
Don’t let go
We’re living it up!
We’re having a good time baby
I was born uptown
I’m the ghetto dream
Now don’t be lazy

Lyrics:

They lit the fires under our feet
Chased us into the hills ......oh
They let the wolves off of the leash
Should a finished the kill

We've got ashes on our shoes
And an outcast attitude
We're all immune 'cos we know the truth is viral

We might be the Outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now
Yeah we might be the Outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now
No bones no drama
We live how we wanna
We might be the Outsiders
Be the Outsiders the Outsiders

We set our tents up on the fringe
With our backs to their cool now
And in our heads we fit right in
Cos they gave us the fuel

We've got ashes on our shoes
And an outcast attitude
We're all immune 'cos you know the truth is viral

We don't need good reputations
We don't need no thought control
We don't need good reputations
(Our smiles are real we don’t fake em)
We don't need no thought control",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8YXmRaM9IH0/sddefault.jpg,0.027419407603053062,0.0002952859280328792,92.85714285714286,0.0009164194472040813,0.027714693531085945,0.028631112978290036,2017-11-21,00:01:00,Tuesday,1,5,23,5,19,34,190,4,44,0,1,4,5,0,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.1740838598421135,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

1) Which types of news/movies headlines (or others) are you tired to hear or read about the most?

2) With JJ coming back for Episode 9 do you think he will retcon any of what Rian Johnson has done?

3) Why do we still use the word “Actress”? Where did it start?

4) Do you think that Wind River’s writer/director, Taylor Sheridan, would make a perfect screenwriter for Matt Reeves’ Batman film?

5) What if we as a society have just moved on from movies? Videogames are now by far the most popular form of entertainment and is still continuing to grow. Is it just possible that cultural zeitgeist of entertainment is no longer movies?

Lyrics 
Deck The Halls 

Deck the halls with boughs of holly, Fa la la la la la la la!

'Tis the season to be jolly, Fa la la la la la la la!
Don we now our gay apparel, Fa la la la la la la la!
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol, Fa la la la la la la la!

See the blazing yule before us, Fa la la la la la la la!
Strike the harp and join the chorus, Fa la la la la la la la!

Follow me in merry measure, Fa la la la la la la la!
While I tell of Yuletide treasure, Fa la la la la la la la!

Fast away the old year passes, Fa la la la la la la la!
Hail the new, ye lads and lasses, Fa la la la la la la la!
Sing we joyous all together! Fa la la la la la la la!
Heedless of the wind and weather, Fa la la la la la la la!

It wasn't clear until 2016, but my biggest concern is that we're still only at the beginning of this. It turns out that affecting human perspective is not all that complicated.

Right now, we're at the point where computers have gotten good at teaching themselves to keep our attention with content that humans are creating. I'm deeply worried about what happens when the computers get good at not just serving up, but creating the content. Advertisers are already working on that exact technology, and if it helps them sell detergent fine. 

But if it gets good at selling ideas, we'll be in a new era of human history. I don't know if Congress will be savvy enough to regulate that, and I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg will be good enough or even powerful enough to control it.

Thanks to John and Taha Khan (https://www.youtube.com/user/KhanStopMe) for advising me on this and helping me get things right. 

Thanks to Grant from Three Blue One Brown for the neural network image. His series on how neural network AI works is REALLY GOOD! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk

""You're crazy,"" the American ski racer replied. ""OK, he has, what, 23 medals?""
Actually, Phelps' haul is 23 golds - and 28 medals in all.
Shiffrin's only medal so far is a gold in slalom at age 18 in 2014 at Sochi.
She comes to the Pyeongchang Games with a chance to become the first skier to win that race twice in a row at the Olympics.
She will also be among the favourites in Monday's giant slalom, and might also enter the downhill and super-G.
For now, though, she'll only commit to entering the slalom and giant slalom.
""I would like to compete in everything,"" she said. ""I'm not sure if I'm actually going to have the energy to do that.""

LETRA:

Espera aí
Preciso tanto conversar
Então vem aqui
Pra gente se entender, sei lá
O seu olhar se desencontrou do meu
Meu coração tá tão longe do seu

Eu tô querendo novamente ver
Pra hoje em dia eu falar pra você
Que a indecisão apertou no coração
Aquele aperto se é sim ou não

Só de pensar um dia te perder
Fiz essa canção pra você não me esquecer
Olha pra mim, deixa eu olhar pra você
Vem mais perto que hoje eu vou te dizer
Me abraça e seu corpo ao meu
O seu peito nunca me esqueceu

Na vida podem existir milhares
Mas nenhuma vai ser como você
Que comigo o amor foi de verdade
Que fez a minha vida acontecer
Eu troco a estrela por um beijo seu
Eu troco aquela lua pelo seu olhar
Eu deixo de viver no paraíso
Minha verdade é você meu lar

Na vida podem existir milhares
Mas nenhum vai ser como você
Que comigo o amor foi de verdade
Que fez a minha vida acontecer
Eu troco a estrela por um beijo seu
Eu troco aquela lua pelo seu olhar
Eu deixo de viver no paraíso
Minha verdade é você meu lar

New Line Cinema’s comedy “Life of the Party” stars Melissa McCarthy under the direction of Ben Falcone.  

When her husband suddenly dumps her, longtime dedicated housewife Deanna (McCarthy) turns regret into re-set by going back to college…landing in the same class and school as her daughter, who’s not entirely sold on the idea.  Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.

The film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”).
McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day.  Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.

Slated for release beginning May 11, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

The cost of this bi-partisan budget deal will be expanding the US' deficit and $20 trillion debt, an astonishing number for a Congress controlled by Republicans, once known for fiscal conservatism.

FAQ: http://bit.ly/2u9uJxX

The list itself is completely objective based on placings and players beaten. However, to create the X-factor a survey was conducted among a panel of community leaders, tournament organizers, and top players from around the world. The X-factor is the difference between their #PGRv4 placing and how they were rated by the panel.

Lyrics:

Living's like a jigsaw
And the farther in you go
If you're missing pieces
Never really know
When you're ticking like a timepiece
On which you can rely
Wonder why you wind it
When you're running out of time

Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

Living's supposed to kill you
But it shouldn't feel like dying
Loving's supposed to fill you
But it spills you like your wine
And all the paper people
Wandering about
Wondering who made them
And who's gonna cut them out

Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

And even in the morning
When the sun's behind the clouds
In the state you're born in
In the state that you're in now
Even if the roof is leaking
It's still above your head
Just remember two words that the two birds never said

Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

Following is a transcript of the video.

Cities pay billions of dollars to host the Olympics. But is it worth it?

Rio estimated the 2016 Olympics would cost $3 billion. Instead, the final cost was closer to $13 billion. The city had to cut healthcare and police spending to afford it. This is what the venues look like just 1 year later.

Host cities hope the increased tourism will be worth it and that the new venues will be used long after the games. However, the costs frequently go over estimates.

Russia estimated the Sochi games would cost $12 billion. Instead, the final cost was around $50 billion. Many oligarchs contributed money to cover the buildout. Russia wound up making just $53 million on the endeavor.

China spent over $40 billion on the 2008 Olympics. While they made a $146 million profit, this is what the stadiums look like today.

To help pay for the 2006 Turin Olympics, the Italian government launched a scratch-off lottery game. Ultimately, the city lost $3.2 million hosting the Olympics. Today, its Olympic Village is used to house refugees.

The 2004 Olympics cost Greece around $11 billion. Many of the stadiums are in disrepair today.

With runaway budgets and stadiums that may never be used again, the Olympics continue to be a big risk for any city to host.

1. Paramount Studios needs your help. What would you pitch as their next big franchise? Or would you move away from the blockbuster movie to something else?

2. Have you ever watched a movie and, at first viewing, disliked it but then watched it again and actually really enjoyed it? 

3. Someone miraculously comes back from the end of 2018 and tells you the following three things:
”    Avengers: Infinity War breaks the Box Office Opening Weekend Record set by The Force Awakens.
”    Han Solo: A Star Wars Story has a 40% Critics Score on Rotten Tomatoes.
”    Dunkirk wins Best Picture at the Oscars.

Which of these statements would you believe the most and which one the least?

4. Do you think DC is limiting themselves by casting another actor, like Jake Gyllenhaal, in their late 30's to play Batman in Matt Reeves’ trilogy? Is it a smart idea to basically re-boot a character notorious for his peak physical condition with an actor who is 37?

5. When you all were children, what did you dream your profession would be when you grew up?

We were even able to get a couple of rides in while we were there! We rode Test Track and Soarin' Around the World, both are great. Then we saw some live dance acts and some live musical acts! That's the best part about EPCOT, there's something fun around almost every corner! With EPCOT being in festival mode for most of the year now, do you have a favorite festival? Let us know in the comments below! I think mine would be Holiday's Around the World. Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

[앵커]
UN군 사령부가 북한군 귀순 당시 JSA에서 촬영된 CCTV 영상의 일부를 공개하기로 했습니다. 총상을 입고 여전히 의식불명 상태인 이 북한 병사가 어떤 경로로 탈주를 했고 또 당시 상황이 어땠는지를 파악할 수 있는 핵심 물증이 될 것 같습니다.

그런데 지금 이 병사 상황이 좋지 않은 것 같습니다. 2차 수술이 끝났는데 이 과정에서 북한군의 건강상태를 알 수 있는 충격적인 소견이 공개되기도 했습니다.

지금부터 김주환 정치안보 전문기자, 안찬일 세계북한연구센터 소장과 함께 자세한 내용 짚어보도록 하겠습니다. 안녕하십니까?


일단 원래 10시 반쯤에 공개를 하겠다 했는데 지금 늦어지고 있는 것 같아요. 왜 그런 겁니까?

[기자]
지금 UN사에서, 사실 UN사령부는 한국군 공보장교가 실제 할 수 있는 데가 별로 없었는데 조금 전에 전해 온 것을 보면 당초 분량이 26초 정도만 공개하겠다라고 했었다라고 합니다.

그런데 이것이 굉장히 오해 살 소지도 있고 그래서 아마 내부 격론을 거쳐서 아마 이 공개 여부는 브룩스 사령관이 결정하게 돼 있는데 좀 더 많은 분량을 공개하는데 시간이 늦어져서.

지금까지 알려진 것은 확정된 것은 아닙니다마는 오후로 넘어간 것 같아요.

[앵커]
그러니까 논란이 있고 당시에 상황이 어땠는지를 워낙 관심들이 많으니까 공개를 하기로 했는데 그렇게 많은 양은 아니었군요?

[기자]
사실 JSA라는 곳이 24시간 CCTV 녹화를 하는 곳입니다. 그런데 상황 발생이 13일 오후 3시 16분부터 구출할 때까지 3시 56분. 그 정도만 해도 30여 분 이상 분량이거든요.

이런 부분만 공개를 해도 오해의 소지가 없을 수가 있는데 아마 UN사령부 내부에서 어떤 보안 문제라든가 이런 게 추론이 가능한데 이런 이유 등을 검토를 했는지 어쨌든 당초 26초 했다가 분량을 늘리는.

지금 국방부 기자실에 저도 오전에 있다가 왔는데 외신기자들까지 해서 이게 굉장히 초미의 관심이기 때문에 굉장히 많은 기자들이 몰려 있는 상황입니다.

[앵커]
박사님, 만약에 공개를 하게 되면 우리가 알 수 있는 정보가 어떤 것들이 있을까요? 어떤 것들을 파악할 수 있을까요?

[인터뷰]
CCTV가 공개되면 많은 정보를 알 수 있습니다. 우선 차량이 간부용 승용차 지프차인지 아니면 보급형 나형차 지프차... (중략)

Lightweight Edson Barboza enjoys time with his family at home in New Jersey, as opponent Khabib Nurmagomedov, already in Las Vegas, trains at the UFC Performance Institute and Cobrinha BJJ. Welterweight Carlos Condit embraces the familiar feel of fighting in Vegas, while his teammate Holm enjoys the novelty of competing closer to home. Women’s featherweight champion Cris Cyborg travels with UFC Hall of Famer Tito Ortiz and her security feline. Cyborg has lunch at a friend’s restaurant, and her fellow headliner eats at UFC headquarters, making a stop to give editing notes.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Gary - I saw a preview for the upcoming season of, ""Marvel: Agents Of Shield"" and it appears the majority of it will take place in space. Immediately when I saw this I thought, ""Oh no..."" because this could sooo go south and downhill quickly. But I wanna know your thoughts/opinions.

Shareef Snuggs - Since you seen Coco, do you think Coco will have the highest opening at the box office for a Thanksgiving release date? Currently, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is #1 at the box office with $109M. Can Coco take that title?

Nancy Brownlee - There were stories going around today that Joss Whedon was off of the Batgirl film and another that said he was still on it. Is Batgirl still going to happen and is Joss still going to direct it?

Jackson Dunn - I read a report that said Jude Law was going to be in the new Captain Marvel film for the MCU. Is this true, and if so, would he instantly become one of the hottest actors in Hollywood considering it would be 2 major franchises he’s in with Potter and the MCU?

Nazeer M - People are saying that Justice League is actually going to lose money. I bunch of people online are saying they’ll lose like $100 million dollars. But when I checked it said Justice League has already made almost $300 million. Didn’t the movie cost $300 million? So how are they saying it’s going to lose money?

3. Unnecessary System Services (3:48)
4. iPhone Analytics (5:51)
5. Close Out Your Apps (6:23)
6. Notifications (7:19)
7. Widgets (8:36)

9. Background App Refresh (9:58)

12. Reduce Motion (11:59)
13. DFU Restore Your iPhone (12:59)

Getting Over It revolves around a silent man by the name of Diogenes sitting in a cauldron and wielding a Yosemite hammer, which he can use to grip objects and move himself with. Using the mouse or trackpad (controllers are supported but make the game harder because of the lack of precision in the joysticks), the player tries to move the man's upper body and sledge hammer in order to climb a steep mountain.[4]



jack :
McLoughlin started to work on his YouTube channel in 2012, under the name ""jacksepticeye"", in which he posted gameplay videos. In 2013, McLoughlin was mentioned in a PewDiePie video, causing him to gain mass popularity. Although his first video was made on 12 November 2012, he joined YouTube on 24 February 2007.

During the month of July 2014, McLoughlin's channel gained over 57 million views. At the time, his channel had only 800,000 subscribers.[2]

He co-starred as the antagonist of the second season of the TV show Scare PewDiePie. However, the series' second season was cancelled before its release, which would have taken place on 9 March 2017.[3]

Since April 2017, McLoughlin has exclaimed his love for voice acting and that he hopes to be part of more voice acting projects in the future.

pewdipie :
Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg born 24 October 1989), known online as PewDiePie , is a Swedish web-based comedian and video producer. He is known for his Let's Play commentaries and vlogs, as well as his following on YouTube.

Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, PewDiePie originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, he dropped out of Chalmers after becoming disinterested with his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Thanks to the hype around the upcoming Fantastic Beasts film, The Crimes of Grindelwald, the Harry Potter universe is very active these days. So we decided to take a look back at the original stories and investigate some of the theories that surround many of the characters and plot points in Wizarding World. Some of them will honestly break you, like the possible reveal on how Tom Riddle, A.K.A. Voldemort finalized his creation of the Horcruxes to why Neville was never able to perform magic as well as his peers in school. There’s one soul crushing theory about Harry and mental illness as well that would be the biggest fear for any diehard Potter fan. There’s a possible revelation that Professor Snape is in fact alive and well after the events of the Deathly Hallows and that Dumbledore’s death was predicted way back in the third book! Speaking of Dumbledore, we have a lot of theories about him, including that he’s in fact Ron Weasley and that thanks to the story of the three brothers, Dumbledore is actually a representation of Death-or at least the master of it. Then there’s more wacky theories that seem to make a whole bunch of weird sense. For instance, Harry Potter is in fact King Arthur and the reason why Dumbledore hired someone like Lockhart to teach at Hogwarts. There’s a chilling theory about the small class sizes at Hogwarts and a hilarious mashup theory about George Weasley and Willy WOnka!

Her cooking has set a standard for Chinese food in America, and has influenced everyone from Alice Waters to James Beard.

유엔군 사령부가 잠시 뒤, 판문점 귀순 과정에 대한 조사 결과를 발표합니다.

논란의 중심이 됐던 CCTV와 열감시 장비 TOD 영상도 함께 공개될 예정이어서 북한군의 군사분계선 침범 의혹 등이 해소될지 관심입니다.

취재기자 연결합니다. 강정규 기자!

그동안 판문점 귀순 과정을 놓고 여러 가지 의혹이 많았는데, 영상이 공개되면 어느 정도 해소가 되겠군요?

[기자]
유엔군 사령부는 잠시 뒤 10시 반에 국방부 브리핑 룸에서 지난 13일에 발생한 판문점 귀순 사건에 대한 조사 결과를 발표합니다.

귀순자의 탈주 과정과 추격조의 총격 장면 등이 담긴 판문점 CCTV 영상도 공개될 예정인데요.

그동안 북한군 추격조가 군사 분계선을 넘는 장면이 CCTV에 포착이 됐느냐를 두고 논란이 많았고,

영상 공개까지 한차례 미뤄지면서 의혹은 더 커진 상탭니다.

유엔군 사령부는 CCTV에 더해, 열감시장비 TOD 영상의 일부도 추가로 공개하기로 했습니다.

우리 측 JSA 경비대대장의 영웅담에 대해 의문을 제기한 YTN 보도로 해당 대대장이 귀순자 구조에 얼마나 적극적으로 나섰는지 논란이 촉발됐기 때문인데요.

북한 귀순자가 총격을 입고 쓰러져 있던 곳은 판문점 CCTV의 사각지대여서 구조 순간은 TOD 영상에 포착돼 있는 것으로 알려졌습니다.

유엔사 관계자는 판문점 영상을 직접 보면 따로 추가 질문이 필요 없을 만큼 모든 의혹이 풀릴 것이라고 말했습니다.

유엔사 브리핑이 끝난 뒤, 11시에는 아주대 병원에서 북한 귀순자의 건강 상태에 대한 브리핑이 이어집니다.

북한 귀순자는 지난 19일 의식을 회복한 뒤 지금은 약간의 대화와 거동도 가능한 상태인 것으로 전해졌습니다.

이에 따라 아주대에 나가 있는 각 정보 기관 요원들이 접근해 귀순자의 나이와 이름 등이 밖으로 유출되기도 했습니다.

의료진은 귀순자가 중환자실에서 격리 치료를 받고 있는 만큼 2차 감염 등이 우려된다며 정보 요원들의 접촉을 차단해 달라고 요청한 것으로 알려졌습니다.

지금까지 국방부에서 YTN 강정규[live@ytn.co.kr]입니다.

Five seasons have been confirmed for the show with possible spinoff series as well which is the reason for the increase in price. Amazon is also required to start production within two years. Further complicating the deal are the negotiations that will have to occur for any usage of any of the films in the series from New Line and parent company Warner Bros. Also, there is no confirmation that Peter Jackson will be involved as his attorney stated that he was not a part of the 2017 rights. Don’t forget thet the Weinsteins have a piece of this pie as well, and disgraced or not, they may want to come for a piece of this in the end if it shows years of profits.

Mark Reilly and Dorian Parks sit down to try to untangle this mess and offer their thoughts on if this is starting to look like a losing proposition for the streaming Amazon service. They also explore what having or NOT having Peter Jackson involved will do for the prestige of the show.

He changed the sport, not just through these three rule changes, but also by instituting offseason training as well as the idea of studying video to plan for opponents. Who’d have guessed that’d help?

Rules include…
1. You can’t put anyone in goal for a penalty shot, it must be the goaltender and they must stay in goal
2. The goalie cannot leave equipment, such as his stick or even a mound of ice, in front of the goal after he has been pulled
3. If you intentionally sub too many men onto the ice it results in a penalty shot

Waiting at the traffic lights this Mustang passed us and drifted into the oncoming lane causing a crash with the couple sitting in the Maserati. The Mustang driver was under the influence of something.

After checking on him I went to the couple in the Maserati to check on them. At first the Mustang driver stayed at the accident, but after 2 minutes he decided to run. The other guys chased him down. When he heard the sirenes coming he ran away for the second time, my friends chase him down again and luckily the police arrived and arrested the Mustang driver.

Gary Vaynerchuk is CEO of the $150  million digital agency servicing Fortune 500 companies. He is a venture capitalist, 4-time New York Times bestselling author, and an early investor in companies such as Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo and Uber.  Gary is currently the subject of DailyVee, an online documentary series highlighting what it’s like to be a CEO and public figure in today’s digital world. He is also the host of #AskGaryVee, a business and advice Q&A show online.

I was featured in Gary's #AskGaryVee show 2 years ago after making a viral YouTube video. There, I met my now good friend India and she joined us for the show! :)

1) 'X-Men' Shake-Up: 'Deadpool 2,' 'Gambit,' 'New Mutants' Get New Dates; Gambit loses director Gore Verbinski

2) DGA Nominees announced

3) ‘Tully’ Trailer Has Charlize Theron Experiencing the Agony of Motherhood in 2018

4) Natalie Portman in Talks to Replace Reese Witherspoon in Sci-Fi ‘Pale Blue Dot’

5) ‘Beirut’ Trailer Finds Jon Hamm Negotiating with Terrorists

6) James Franco: Will allegations hurt his Oscar chances? 

7) Live Twitter Questions 

Yesterday, Deadline revealed that the Gambit movie spin-off in the X-Men universe encountered even more trouble when Gore Verbinski, the third director in as many years, left the project citing scheduling conflicts. On the heels of the announcement, THR reports that Fox has shifted their release schedule for their upcoming X-Men movies.

The Directors Guild of America announced their nominations for the feature film category. The DGA is a pretty heavy precursor for the Oscar nominations, so the films and filmmakers recognized here will certainly get a boost in Oscar voting. And the nominees are: Guillermo del Toro – The Shape of Water / Greta Gerwig – Lady Bird / Jordan Peele – Get Out / Martin McDonagh – Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri / Christopher Nolan – Dunkirk. 

AGREE/DISAGREE

Focus Features has released the first trailer for Tully starring Charlize Theron. Directed by Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody, the story focuses on an overworked mother who is gifted a night nanny, Tully, played by Mackenzie Davis. 

While Fargo and Legion creator Noah Hawley’s feature debut Pale Blue Dot suffered a setback last year when Reese Witherspoon vacated the lead role, a switcheroo is underway to keep things on track. Variety reports that Oscar-winner Natalie Portman is now in talks to take over the part.

Ahead of the film’s debut at the Sundance Film Festival, Bleecker Street has released the first trailer for the upcoming thriller Beirut. Written by Bourne Trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy and directed by The Machinist helmer Brad Anderson, the film takes place in 1982 and stars Jon Hamm as a U.S. diplomat and expert negotiator who is tasked by the CIA to negotiate for the life of a friend he left behind. 

James Franco: Will allegations hurt his Oscar chances? Ellis will lead the panel in a discussion about whether these new allegations against James Franco will hurt his Oscar chances for The Disaster Artist.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Luke Harding: My name is Luke Harding. I'm a journalist and a writer, and my new book is called ""Collusion,"" and it's about Donald Trump and Russia.

Putin and money, they're a taboo topic inside Russia. I wrote stories about this in 2007 based on sources inside his presidential administration who were saying, quietly, that he was worth about $40 billion. That was a decade ago.

The thing is Russia's a kleptocracy. It's also the world's biggest oil producer and the people at the top of the Russian state are all kind of multibillionaires. And Putin is at the head of this pyramid although officially his salary's $100 thousand a year.

Putin allegedly controls 37% of Russian oil company Surgutneftegaz

4.5% of natural gas company Gazprom.

He also has holdings in commodities trader Gunvor.

In 2012, estimates of his wealth were upped to $70 billion.

Luke Harding: Now, everyone in the Russian elite knows he's the richest guy in town by a long way, but the beauty of the system is that formally nothing belongs to him and everything is held by proxies, some of whom are now under US sanctions.

It's a kind of clever system, but of course, he's enormously rich and for Putin, the thing about money is it's kind of liquid power, and power ultimately is what interests him.

But I'm not sure that it's perfect.

I think there are a couple of big issues near the end of the film that can all be mitigated by introducing one new line of dialogue much earlier. Here is what I mean.

Check out this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos

Quantum supremacy’s that moment when a quantum computer beats the best supercomputers at solving some kind of problem, and it’s a very exciting time right now in quantum computing because, as of recording this video we’re on the brink of having quantum supremacy. In this video I quickly describe how quantum computing works, what quantum computers exist in the world today and what you need to do to prove quantum supremacy.

When I posted this video quantum supremacy hadn’t been reached, but people are predicting that it will happen soon.
Also the qubit numbers I posted for the different quantum computing efforts will go out of date quite quickly, so they won’t be valid if you are watching this in the future. Hello from April 2018!
And full disclosure - I used to work at D-Wave but I don’t have any favourites, I’m excited by progress on all fronts and believe they all deserve the same critical analysis.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Daniel Marcuson - Hey John! Love the show. There are some conflicting bits of information out there about just how much of the Han Solo movie was reshot and how much left. So just how much did Ron Howard do on this and will it still hit the May release date?

Rebecca Stein - Have you seen that new picture of Jason Statham in Meg with the shark? The thing look creepy and I love it. What do you think the chances are that this movie ends up being any good?

Bobby Russell - What do you think of Tarantino hiring Mark Smith to write the script for his Star Trek movie? With the hire, does this now officially mean the movie is actually happening? Is Tarantino actually directing?

Daem Choudhury - Hey John how are you? I know this is kind of movie related, but recently Marc Guggenheim said that deathstroke is now off limits on arrow because of his role in the DCEU. As a fan of arrow, im disappointed because Manu Bennett is F'ing awesome as Slade. What are your thoughts on WB not allowing CW use characters because of the DCEU? Its like my tiny brain cant differentiate between tv and movies.

Ryan Hersch - Ok it’s the end of the year and my favorite movie of 2017 is still Logan. I’m not going to be one of those guys that will yell snub if it doesn’t get a best picture nomination but I was wondering what your thoughts were on its chances. No comic-book superhero movie has ever been nominated. Is there any chance it could happen now?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91H09ziLdzQ/hqdefault.jpg,0.037961372638367984,0.0018928108240737493,20.055555555555557,0.0057134845245189105,0.039854183462441725,0.04556766798696064,2017-12-22,19:14:43,Friday,4,14,17,14,17,92,133,2,34,0,0,13,16,2,0,6.0,7.0,"['RESHOT MORE OF', 'AUN']","['RESHOT', 'MORE', 'OF', 'AUN']",True,"['reshot', 'more', 'OF', 'aun']",4,4,15,0,1,0,2,6.218453238742933,3,"['happy', 'happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/94Z6spbUkD0/sddefault.jpg,0.01951437908671956,0.0003646044176114657,53.522058823529406,0.0012653918022986165,0.019878983504331017,0.021144375306629642,2018-03-20,08:35:01,Tuesday,1,7,36,7,31,46,323,2,76,0,1,6,14,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.443775310417881,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

My name is Ted Forbes and I make videos about photography. I’ve been making photographs most of my life and I have a tremendously deep passion for photography that I want to share with you on YouTube. 

The Art of Photography is my channel and I produce photography videos to provide a 360 degree look into the world of making images. We all want to get better so lets do this together!

I make videos covering famous photographers, photography techniques, composition, the history of photography, philosophy and much more.

I also have a strong community of photographers who watch the show and we frequently do social media challenges for photographers to submit their own work. I feature the best and most interesting on the show when we do these so come check it out and get involved!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/968NtXHx8_4/sddefault.jpg,0.017531014846451087,0.0011958511287370349,14.659863945578227,0.0017653040471832418,0.018726865975188123,0.02049217002237137,2017-12-20,16:01:26,Wednesday,2,11,43,11,31,65,375,3,56,5,2,1,12,3,1,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.818611404291942,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'bottle': 1, 'person': 3}",4

Wanted to see your face
end up calling me names 

I slept, I slept in too late 
Burnt my tongue, missed the train 
All because of that look you gave me

My sister says I should give up 
My friends say you're not good enough
Now im seeing right through you
Im seeing what they never saw in you 

Tell me are you even in it? 
Cause Im done tryin in a minute 
And Just like that
Just like that
There's nothing left of…..
You can come get all your t shirts
Cause I dont like the way I look in them
And just like that 
Just like that
Theres nothing left of you 

I think you love when we fight
So you feel something inside 
What a depressing sight  

Maybe youd love me if I 
had more money to buy 
All the shit that you think you’d like  

your sister says I should give up 
your friends say you're not good enough

Lyrics:
I want it all
But i can’t have it
images fly by
i cannot say much
But i want it all
And i want it all

When she closes her eyes
Looks inside
Never knowing

Shooting for the stars
It’s gone too far
And you know it

I can’t keep you there
You’re everywhere
Forever glowing

It’s a trick of the eye
It passes me by
Keeps on going

You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
You don’t give a fuck
Swimming pools
You break all the rules
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
Backseat give a fuck

i want it all
but I can’t have it
images fly by
i cannot say much
but i want it all
And i want it all

You’re my trick of the eye
that passes me by
u keep on going

I can’t keep you there
You’re everywhere
Forever glowing

You’re my trick of the eye
that passes me by
u keep on going",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9800fOlCmLg/sddefault.jpg,0.011261112505448926,0.00015851419362508751,71.04166666666667,0.0011954612102558686,0.011419626699074013,0.01261508790932988,2018-05-11,13:43:08,Friday,4,4,1,4,1,20,2,4,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,2.0,"['2?', '4', 'Pa', '', 'Pie', 'Ot Ea', '', 'ONVOaaAL', 'PEALE']","['2?', '4', 'Pa', 'Pie', 'Ot', 'Ea', 'ONVOaaAL', 'PEALE']",True,"['2', '?', '4', 'Pa', 'pie', 'Ot', 'Ea', 'onvoaaal', 'peal']",9,9,24,1,0,3,0,3.0039608445545607,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

There are three major forms of lead-acid batteries used in cars which will be discussed in this video: Flooded Lead Acid, Spiral Cell Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM), and Flat Plate AGM. 

Flooded lead acid batteries are the most common lead-acid battery found in OEM applications. They offer a cost-effective solution, however they can require more maintenance, and must be mounted upright to avoid spills. 

Spiral Cell & Flat Plate Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) batteries offer unique advantages over traditional flooded lead acid style batteries. They are maintenance free, and because they use 99.99% pure lead, they offer better cold cranking amps and deep cycling characteristics. They are also more flexible for mounting, as the absorbed glass mat medium prevents acid from spilling.

You may not have remembered little ol' Baltimore, surrounded by a bunch of other major East Coast cities, but it's got some really great, nicely connected neighborhoods worth checking out! Unfortunately, it's also got some profoundly stupid things that have killed off many of its historically black neighborhoods. In this video, I yell at those profoundly stupid things.

Here is what you'll need!

Pool Noodle Candy Canes

MATERIALS
Pool noodle
Duct tape
Fishing line
Hair dryer (optional) 

STEPS
Take the pool noodle and wrap the duct tape around it in a spiral to create a candy cane appearance. 
Bend the pool noodle around ¾ of the way to the top to create the candy cane bend, if the noodle is too stiff, warm it up using a pool noodle to create a better bend. 
Use fishing line to hold the shape in place. 

Popsicle Stick Snowflake

MATERIALS
Popsicle sticks
Hot glue
Spray paint
Gloves

STEPS
Create your favorite snowflake shape using the popsicle sticks, glue the pieces together at the ends using hot glue. Let the glue dry completely. 
Put gloves on, and paint the snowflake using spray paint. Let dry completely before use. 
We used fishing line to hang our snowflakes. 

Giant Ornaments

MATERIALS
Large inflatable bouncing ball
Disposable pie tin
Wire
Wire cutters
Pliers
Industrial glue
Duct tape

STEPS
Take a pie tin that that is proportional to your ball, and will look like an ornament cap when placed on it. 
Next, cut your wire large enough to look like the ornament hanger, bend it so that it forms a semicircle. 
Bend the two ends of the wire about 1 inch to form a 90 degree angle at each end. The ends should point towards each other. 
Flip the pie tin so the opening faces downwards. Take the two ends of the wire and poke them through opposite ends of the pie tin near the top (opposite the opening). 
Tape the wire down with duct tape on the inside of the pie tin. 
Trace the rim of the pie tin opening with industrial glue, and glue it to your ball.
Decorate as you wish. Display with the “ornament cap” sitting at the top of the ball. 

“Snow” Balls 

MATERIALS
Epsom salt
Glitter
Styrofoam ball
Decoupage glue 
Paint brush
gloves

STEPS
In a bowl, mix together 2 cups of epsom salt and glitter. The amount of glitter used is up to one’s own discretion. This will be the snow mixture. 
Put gloves on. Take a styrofoam ball and coat it in the glue. 
Place the styrofoam ball into the snow mixture and cover it completely. 
To add more dimension and create different snowball shapes, go back and forth between the glue and the snow mixture to add more layers. 
Let the snowballs dry completely before use.

Jar Snow Globe

MATERIALS
Jar
Water
Dish soap
Glycerin
Hot Glue
Glitter
Small Christmas figurines

STEPS
Clean your jar. To remove any stickers, place the jar in a bowl of warm water and dish soap for 15 minutes. Wipe away the sticker and rinse the jar clean. For really tough stickers, leave in the mixture for longer. 
Using hot glue, plant your figurines to the inside of the jar lid. Let this dry completely. 
In the jar, mix together the water and glycerin. For our jar we used 2.5 cups of water to 1.5 tablespoons of glycerin. It is a ratio of 5 parts water to 3 parts glycerin. 
Next add the glitter, the amount used it optional. The glycerin will make the glitter fall slowly. 
Screw the lid back on, and hot glue around the rim to ensure that no water comes out. 
Shake away.

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Bobpool - The new Deadpool 2 teaser

Ricardo Ramirez - Hey John love your show  ,big fan of yours, keep up the amazing work. My question for you is: Why don't  big movie studios  release their big box office movies in January and February, if they know that's there no real competition in those two months.

Max Tromp - Hey John Love the show. Have you watched this week’s episode of Lucifer? I started watching the show after your recommendation and I binged it. I thought this week's episode had a really great ending. What are your thoughts on the episode and the current season in general?

Gabriela - Hello, John! I am a huge fan of your show. My question is: Do you think the Academy would ever switch to gender-neutral categories? For example, instead of Best Actress and Actor, it's just Best Actor/Performer of that year in film, in the way that Best Director isn't divided into gender categories. Just a thought that popped into my head. Thanks! 

Jordan Stephan - What are your thoughts on Get Out being placed in the Comedy/Musical category for Golden Globes award consideration? Certainly it will get some love in that less crowded category now, but this seems like another ridiculous entry like The Martian. It frustrates me when they do this because it prevents actual comedies (like Girls Trip, The Big Sick, or The Emoji Movie jk) from getting recognition.

Daniel Yamasaki - Hey John! I was wondering have you seen Justice League yet? If so what are your overall thoughts on the film?

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I see the smoke rising high from our ashes
I feel the fire lose its warmth once again
Swimming in the rain with our last book of matches
I can't find the flame, I can't feel a thing
You got that faking look in your pretty blue eyes

[Chorus]
I need a break
I need a break in the worst way
I need a break for a second or an hour of the day
I need a heartbreak
I need a heartbreak

[Verse 2]
Give me a night where the stars make a blanket
Give me a day drinking naked on the kitchen floor
I want the kind of love that hurts when you take it away from me
I think that now you see
You got that faking look in your pretty blue eyes

[Chorus]
I need a break
I need a break in the worst way
I need a break for a second or an hour of the day
I need a heartbreak
I need a heartbreak

[Bridge]
Oh, these fights don't feel like they used to
I need more
Oh, these fights don't feel like they used to
I need more
Oh, these fights don't feel like they used to
I need more

[Chorus]
I need a break
I need a break in the worst way
I need a break for a second or an hour of the day
I need a heartbreak
I need a heartbreak

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches.

Les autorités ont déclaré l’état d’urgence et commencé à évacuer la zone : 770 bâtiments sont concernés et 1 700 personnes sont sous le coup d’évacuations obligatoires, mais 10 000 personnes vivent dans la zone en question.    Deux centres d’accueil ont pour l’instant été ouverts pour accueillir les évacués. Le gouverneur a appelé l’armée de réserve (National Guard) pour aider aux opérations de secours, a-t-il expliqué sur Twitter.    Plus tôt, à 10 h 30, un tremblement de terre de magnitude 5, suivi de nombreuses répliques, au sud de la bouche éruptive de Puu Oo, a provoqué des chutes de pierres et une potentielle rupture dans le cratère du volcan, selon l’Institut américain d’études géologiques.

PAQ go head-to-head to see who can get the sickest grime-inspired fit.

Freshly back on home soil after their whirlwind trip in New York, the boys decide to celebrate a homegrown culture having worldwide impact on the fashion world. Yep, Grime. From TNs to tracksuits, Ed Hardy to Avirex, they leave no stone unturned in order to find the perfect grime fits.

The guys' final fits are judged by none other than Julie Adenuga, radio presenter for Apple Beats 1 UK and sister of Grime icons JME and Skepta.

Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9H6LlTpVoLI/sddefault.jpg,0.010897866058247215,0.0002684203462622467,40.6,0.0005905247617769428,0.011166286404509463,0.011756811166286405,2018-01-11,09:35:00,Thursday,3,8,38,8,33,44,334,1,79,0,1,7,14,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.684162866990406,4,"['happy', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,2,{'person': 3},3

Not only that, he has done so many disrespectful acts in Japan. How do Japanese people feel about that? Did his actions make a bad image about foreigners? Let’s find it out!

They claim to have been behind the low audience score for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Their plan is to “strike back” against what they perceive to be the unfair treatment of DC’s films by critics and audiences. They also seem to be planning on spreading spoilers to segments of Marvel fans about Black Panther in an effort to ruin their movie going experience. Will they be successful in this venture? And does this kind of movement signal a new kind of “online terrorism” against superhero/fantasy/sci-fi blockbuster films from rival studios in the future? 

John Rocha and Mark Reilly are here to give you their reactions to this news and answer these questions. They also break down if they think this group will be successful in affecting the box office for Black Panther. And they also look at what this could mean for other Disney and Marvel films in the future. Let us know what your thoughts are about this news in the Comments section below.

Kelly’s time may finally be up. His assistant, publicist, and lawyer recently quit, and they’re all female.

Tom Joyner vowed to stop playing his music. A group of powerful women of color, including Shonda Rhimes, Eva Longoria, Ava Duvernay, Kerry Washington, and Viola Davis announced a campaign to help “#MuteRKelly.”

Wendy tells us about her meeting with R. Kelly a few weeks ago and asks the audience if she should invite him to the purple couch. 

Then, Kanye West wants to use the mugshot of the doctor who operated on his mother before she died as the cover of his new album.

Plus, “Jersey Shore”’s Ronnie Magro-Ortiz and his girlfriend broke up after a very public, nasty fight and yesterday they got into a physical fight, which played out on Instagram live.

Leonard Doyle from the International Organization for Migration joins Counting the Cost to discuss Libya's modern-day slavery.

The UN-backed government in Libya said it's looking into allegations that African migrants are being sold at 'slave markets' in Libya.

According to reports, the trade works by preying on the tens of thousands of vulnerable people who risk everything on what's been described as the deadliest route on earth.

They use smartphones to connect with people smugglers to get them to the coast in the hope that they can cross the Mediterranean into Europe.

There is no proper registration process for the tens of thousands of refugees arriving in Libya.

According to reports, the business of detention centres is unsupervised in some parts of the country and stories of torture, rape and forced labour have emerged.

When the centres get too crowded, people are then allegedly sold off like goods in an open market.

The International Organization for Migration says trade in humans has become so normalised that people are being bought and sold in public for as little as $400.

""As shocking as it seems, it's indeed true. And the reason it [slave trade] can happen is because there is really no rule of law across much of Libya.

Libya is a country as big as France, with a lot of space there. Migrants are coming there.... they see the promise of a new life when they go to their Facebook feed and they think something wonderful is waiting for them in Europe, because a smuggler has abused the system and has sold them that lie,"" says Doyle.

""They get off the bus when they arrive in Libya and they are quickly put into a kind of murder machine, an extortion machine. They are robbed of their possessions, their families are called.

They are forced, they are tortured, they give them money. And then they are sold. Unbelievable, but they are sold in open, public auctions: $400 for a labouring man, maybe a bit more for a women who can be put in the sex trade. And this is what's happening across the country.""

My Mom's Secret Family: https://youtu.be/cwOCcViDAQ0

Kim worked as a child maid and helper to a family with an American GI husband in Saigon in her early teenage years. Her mother lived in poverty and needed Kim and her sister's salary in order to raise her other children, so the two sisters were put to work. Kim had a chance to go to America where the family didn't allow her to go to school or go outside. She was basically a prisoner. Eventually, she escaped by faking a pregnancy and she had to move away to another state. When she came back, the family who brought her over disappeared along with Kim's background. Only the American GI's wife knew of Kim's origins but she was cruel and evil. She didn't even mail all of Kim's letters back to her mother. Her mother was never told of her whereabouts or condition. Years passed. No clue, no names, no known locations, everything was a faint memory to Kim until the family who brought her over's son was found by Jon after endless days and weeks of searching. He provided an important clue to the whole mystery with the form of an address and that's where I came into the picture.

Lyrics:
You slide out on sunset
Head west on bedrest
On your own

Get dressed to undress
Depressed to impress
All night long

Turn on the TV
They all wanna see me
Come undone

Pick all the petals
Off all the daisies
One by one

The feelings here
The pattern caught
In a falling tear
And in the waves
One goes and
The other one knows

(one high)
The feelings here
(she rolls)
The pattern caught In a falling tear
(too soon)
And in the waves
(she goes)
One goes and
The other one knows

Kim & John Iadarola break it down. Give us your thoughts in the comments below!

""When Paramount released the Amy Adams–starring Arrival in November 2016, it was one of the biggest hits of the year for the studio. It grossed $203 million worldwide, was critically acclaimed, and netted eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Denis Villeneuve. On paper, the upcoming sci-fi drama Annihilation looks like a similar project for the studio. It’s from an acclaimed filmmaker (Alex Garland, who made Ex Machina), has a big female star (Natalie Portman), and is aimed at the kind of grown-up audience Paramount has targeted in recent years with movies like Fences, Allied, and The Big Short. Only this time, the studio doesn’t seem eager to be associated with the project.""

I would of filmed it but as I said they were new friends and I didn't want to freak them out by asking if I could film them and their kids eating.  haha How to Cook That is my youtube channel it is  filled with crazy sweet creations made just for you.   Join me for creative cakes, chocolate & desserts,  new video every Friday.
