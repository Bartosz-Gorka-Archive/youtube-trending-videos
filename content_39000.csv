Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

One of her standout tracks on her 2018 debut ‚ÄòAurora‚Äô is the body-positive anthem ‚ÄúS.L.U.T.,‚Äù which stands for ‚ÄúSweet Little Unforgettable Thing.‚Äù The song is produced by Ido Zmishlany, who has also worked with Shawn Mendes, Demi Lovato, and Sabrina Carpenter.

‚ÄúS.L.U.T.‚Äù is all about embracing self-love and empowering women. Miller tells Genius that when she was on her way to the studio to write the song, she came across a hateful and slut-shaming comment on her Instagram post that criticized her outfit. Miller decided to flip the negativity into a positive sentiment, giving new meaning to the derogatory word.

The man‚Äôs a genius, and most recently won the Best Actor - Drama gong at The Golden Globes 2018 for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. What an accolade.
 
In our latest episode of LADs On Film, he recounts the hilarious anarchic antics of Harrison Ford on the set of 1997 thriller Air Force One.
 
With the film‚Äôs aircraft set riddled with three signs reading no smoking/eating/drinking, Gary saw Harrison disobeying the rules - and it‚Äôs clear zero f*cks were given:
 
‚ÄúOne day when I looked around, he [Harrison] was standing in the doorway beneath the signs. He was drinking a coffee, eating a burrito and smoking a cigar.‚Äù
 
Harrison - you were one rule break away from an ASBO, sir.
 
According to Gary, that was his favourite moment on a film set. That would probably be topping our list too if we‚Äôd seen it.
 
Darkest Hour, starring Gary Oldman, hits UK cinemas on January 12.

From the Arcade Editor Manual:
https://far-cry.ubisoft.com/game/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-319428-16&ct=tcm:154-76770-32

Welcome to the Far Cry Arcade Editor! With this tool, you are able to make solo maps, 2-player co-op maps and multiplayer maps for up to 12 players. There are six game modes in total: Assault, Outpost, Journey, Bounty Hunt, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. What‚Äôs more, there are over 10,000 objects you can use from Far Cry 5, Far Cry 4, Far Cry Primal, Watch Dogs, Assassin‚Äôs Creed Black Flag and Assassin‚Äôs Creed Unity to create any kind of map you like.

This guide will take you through the basic process of making your first map in each of these game modes, but in each case, you should take the time to explore all the options and settings the editor has to offer.  You can add objects, enemies, animals, and health, weapon and ammo pickups. You can change the terrain, add water, underground areas, and change the weather, time of day, and other environment settings.  And you can even fully customise up to four weapon and ammo loadouts to encourage different playstyles.  Infinite maps, infinite fun ‚Äì it all starts here!

INITIAL MAP SETUP

After launching the Far Cry Arcade Editor choose the ‚ÄúNew Map‚Äù option. The next window that appears will ask for the game mode. Each game mode requires specific game mode objects to be included to make sure the map can be played correctly. These are things like spawn points, objectives and extraction points. You can also choose the terrain type for your map.

Once the map has been generated, you will find the game mode objects you need by first clicking on the Objects icon at the top of the screen, then selecting Game mode objects in the browser that opens on the right side of the screen. The Game mode objects panel appears at the bottom of this browser. Each game mode will have a different list of objects.

It is the eleventh installment and the fifth main title in the Far Cry series. It was released on March 27, 2018.

Similar to its predecessors, Far Cry 5 is an action-adventure first-person shooter set in an open world environment which the player can explore freely on foot or via various vehicles. Unlike previous titles in the series where the player takes on the role of a set character, the game will feature a new character creator, which the player can use to customize their character's appearance. The player will have a variety of ranged and explosive weapons to fight against enemies, while the game will place a renewed emphasis on close-quarters combat compared to previous Far Cry titles by introducing a wider range of melee weapons.

Creative director Dan Hay described the design of the open world as being modelled on the outposts from previous titles in the Far Cry series. These outposts represented a small section of the map occupied by enemy forces and the player was tasked with liberating them by killing or neutralising the enemy presence. The outposts were designed with multiple approaches for the player to take and it was this element that the development team tried to recreate in the wider game world of Far Cry 5. The player is dropped into the game world with little context, direction or objective markers and is instead required to navigate the world on their own. Hay expressed a desire to create what he termed the ""anecdote factory"", a game where two players could venture out from the same point in opposite directions and have completely different experiences that they would then share with one another anecdotally.[citation needed] The game world will also respond to the player's actions; for example, civilians will move back into an area once the player has eliminated cult influence and may provide additional support or make other civilians more sympathetic to the player character's cause.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nLDKjBP6jA8/sddefault.jpg,0.012820351204507923,0.0018530891121560128,6.918367346938775,0.0029498153213912033,0.014673440316663938,0.017623255638055137,2018-04-02,23:39:31,Monday,0,13,86,12,25,64,505,1,55,0,0,9,0,2,3,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.816306313816725,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

I'm not familiar with the game, but i think it's an 'Elvens Dagger'. Correct me if i'm wrong  :)

For the brass i use empty bullet shells/casings which i melt in my metal foundry.

The bullet shells were bought at a local shooting range here in Belgium.

The giveaway will last a week, and the winners will win 25 euro which will be transfered by paypall or bank transfer.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nN6j69adlW0/sddefault.jpg,0.012473616986584295,0.0003261076336361907,38.25,0.00076544708450717,0.012799724620220485,0.013565171704727656,2018-06-13,08:35:00,Wednesday,2,11,40,11,35,57,351,3,79,0,1,8,19,2,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.689233950873287,2,"['neutral', 'scared']",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

A seasoned voiceover artist is just trying to do his job as he reads his script out loud in his distinguished voice and accent.

But a trio of demanding corporate clients listening in on the recording session have other ideas, offering criticism at nearly every line.

When one of them offers a ludicrous ""suggestion"" meant to improve his work, it pushes the artist to the brink. And what he does next is both surprising, hilarious and deeply satisfying.

This award-winning short comedy is self-contained and its premise is simple. But Sam H. Buchanan's skillful directing works within its constraints, and the film never loses pace with its excellent rhythm and editing.

With its tight, economical writing, intelligent wit and well-calibrated performances, ""The Lion"" is a flawlessly executed satire about work, art and corporations -- with a punchline that anyone who's ever had a frustrating day at work should relate to.

And it‚Äôs for that reason that, for the last several years, the they have kept quiet about their involvement in JUST Water, a bottled water brand that comes in 82 percent recyclable packaging. As Will tells it, they didn‚Äôt want to distract consumers from the brand‚Äôs message about environmental sustainability and make them think it was just another vanity project from a celebrity family in Hollywood.

But now the Smiths are preparing to take a more public role to support the brand they helped build both financially as investors and conceptually as co-founders. Will and Jaden sat down with BevNET at Natural Products Expo West 2018 in Anaheim, Calif. to discuss the brand‚Äôs recent move into flavored SKUs, how they have helped develop both the commercial and mission-based sides of the company, how they‚Äôre using their media platform to build a disruptive brand, and a new initiative to donate bottled water to Flint, Mich., which is still without clean drinking water two years on from its lead contamination crisis.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNFT1isFgUY/sddefault.jpg,0.014137595101131937,0.0004320142883651883,32.7248322147651,0.0011815155873074784,0.014569609389497125,0.0157511249768046,2018-03-16,16:30:14,Friday,4,12,30,12,28,65,251,1,46,1,1,9,18,4,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.758873144443438,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'bottle': 2, 'person': 2}",4

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Disney/Fox deal is now complete. Iger confirms X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool to all join the MCU

Jake Brownlee - As one of the few guys on YouTube constantly being positive about the upcoming Sony Venom movie, what did you make of the casting of Woody Harrelson in the movie? I think he‚Äôs a great actor. You always say it‚Äôs never a bad idea to add talent right? Also, what do you think the chances are that he could be playing Carnage as some have speculated?

PATREON Supporter Dale Lansley - Hi John, I have 2 related questions about that annoying Variety TLJ review firstly could Variety face any backlash from Disney for that review? I‚Äôm guessing they didn‚Äôt really break any rules. Also I don‚Äôt want to risk reading variety's articles about SW have they addressed the reviews issues yet? Keep up the great work.
 
Cameron Casaus - Hey John, Love the show, and congrats again on the subs. With WB being in the entertainment news stream lately, what's going on with this WB Lawsuit over the conjuring. Thanks John!

David Rainey - Hi John. Loving the content and thrilled to make it a part of my day. The marvel portion of the Disney/Fox deal excites me. But I'm really excited they will walk away with 60% of Hulu. I believe they will use Hulu instead of launching their own streamer. It would allow them to use Fox's library without attaching the Disney name and it's already a player in the market. Besides why compete with yourself?

Tom Anderson - Hey John!  Been watching for years, first time submitting a question.  I noticed Lady Bird dropped down to 99% on Rotten Tomatoes due to a single rotten review, but upon checking that review, the reviewer gave it a B-.  Why's that considered ""rotten""?   I'm not a fan of RT, and this is a pretty good example of why.

The main tremors occurred between 9 and 10pm last night, with three moderate tremors of magnitude 5 or above. Taiwanese folk lore attributes quakes to the rumblings of an ox deep in the earth; seismologists however, are divided over whether another major quake could be coming soon. The island of Taiwan experienced seven tremors centred on Hualien last night, starting at 12 minutes past nine in the evening. The tremors lasted an hour, with the first of magnitude 5.1, and the third, magnitude 5.8, believed to be the strongest of the series.Chen Kuo-changCBW Seismological Center HeadThis quake occurred when tectonic plates exerted pressure on each other. The Philippine Sea Plate was squeezing the Eurasian Plate. A moderate earthquake is one of magnitude five or above; it is fairly unusual to see so many of these occur at once.The Seismological Center detected three tremors of magnitude five or above within one hour, the most in such a short period since 1972. From last night to four thirty this afternoon, a total of 66 tremors shook Taiwan. Scholars say this may be the start of the once-in-a-century major earthquake season.Prof. Lee Chyi-TyiNCU Applied Geology InstituteWhen subduction occurs - our tectonic plate moves against another and sinks into the mantle - it can cause a quake of magnitude eight or above. This generally only happens about once every 100 years. The active earthquake season has started now.Prof. Wu Yih-minNTU Geosciences Dept.This quake occurred in a different place to the great 1920 quake, which was slightly deeper, in the subduction zone; in that case the plate was bumping against the crust by its front edge.Expert opinion is split on the likelihood of a major quake in the near future. But nonetheless scholars advise the public to have evacuation plans in place.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNqojgE8j0o/sddefault.jpg,0.004582111436950147,0.0003665689149560117,12.5,0.0005498533724340174,0.004948680351906157,0.005498533724340175,2018-02-06,09:05:34,Tuesday,1,9,7,9,7,51,54,0,16,0,0,2,4,2,0,5.0,7.0,['ELLE Ho'],"['ELLE', 'Ho']",True,"['ell', 'Ho']",2,2,5,0,0,1,0,6.724796765937293,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOdJXehTrDc/sddefault.jpg,0.03415505031616569,0.0003174180910173703,107.60272108843536,0.0004262471507947544,0.034472468407183064,0.03489871555797782,2018-04-12,05:20:07,Thursday,3,9,37,7,32,44,328,5,76,2,1,8,16,1,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.064465724648105,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

hi! sooooo I applied to 15 colleges (Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Yale, Duke, UPenn, UCLA, Berkeley, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Rice, & the University of Minnesota) and here are my reactions to ~most~ of them. I almost religiously watched college reaction/college admission journey videos so I really just felt the need to make this (sorry I kinda seem emotionless but its that time of year ya know). If you would like to know more about my college application process let me know because talking about college and shiz is fun. STAY TUNED FOR MORE COLLEGE VIDS (stats, extracurriculars, and that stuff)!

special thanks to the all the people that helped me with my college application process!!

They make a variety of noises which all have some level of feeling behind them, but they leave you to wonder what it is they are trying to
communicate. That‚Äôs why this AnimalWised video brings you the different types of a cat‚Äôs meow and the meanings behind them. Many of these are normal sounds which represent their day-to-day goings on. Others are meows which intimate there may be trouble or even if they have something frustrating on their mind, as they do when they are in heat.

-------

In this video, we take an in depth look at the new first class cabins offered by Emirates aboard a very relaxing and pleasant flight from Dubai to Brussels on the Emirates Boeing 777 aeroplane. The first class suites offered by Emirates are so versatile, with the functions of a lounge, hotel, restaurant, cinema and even disco all facilitated within each individual cabin, so come with me as we eat, drink, sleep and even dance our way from the United Arab Emirates to Belgium!

We were very lucky to have the entire first class shuttle bus to ourselves as we made our way to Dubai International Airport on board the COBUS 3000. Emirates provide this special bus exclusively for first class travellers with comfortable and wide leather seats and a pleasing, bright interior.

We were in for a real treat once we boarded the plane ‚Äì our first class cabin is a completely enclosed, floor to ceiling suite ensuring total privacy whenever you need it. Within the cabin, a massive 32 inch high definition (HD) television and a smaller display closer to the seat are able to display live footage of the surroundings of the plane, received directly from the aeroplane‚Äôs exterior cameras, allowing you to watch the take off and touch down of the Emirates flight and everything that happens in between. We examine and discuss the aeroplane‚Äôs exterior cameras further with the aeroplane‚Äôs pilots in our visit to the cockpit of this fabulous Emirates Boeing 777 plane.

We weren‚Äôt just the only passenger on the first class shuttle bus, but also the only passenger in first class on the flight! This gave us the perfect opportunity to test what is a world first on board service ‚Äì facilities for requesting room service and cabin service via video call, which can be activated and used without even leaving your seat! Come with us and watch as we make full use of this brand new service to keep thirst at bay with great mimosas and even vintage Dom Perignon 2009!

As you would expect, Emirates go all out for their first class customers to ensure that every little detail is taken care of. From soft and comfy slippers to hydra active pyjamas which keep your skin moisturised as you sleep to powerful binoculars that let you survey all that can be seen from the windows, there are little surprises and treats in every little corner of these new Emirates first class cabins. We are even able to make use of the bespoke lighting control system within each cabin which means that we can set the lights to whatever intensity and colour best fits our mood.
The food served in Emirates first class is particularly amazing ‚Äì see the mouth watering dishes laid before us including canapes and caviar and Arabic mezze for starters, delicious stir fried pawns for the main and cheese and crackers, pear and chocolate crumble and ice cream for dessert.

Once we‚Äôre all fed, it‚Äôs the perfect time for a nap to digest all of these gastronomic delights and the curtains and blinds which can be brought down and over on the windows give a real cosy and comfortable bedroom in the sky feeling which makes us feel right and home and relaxed and able to drift off.

You won‚Äôt want to miss this Emirates first class cabin documentary and all of its delights. What did you like best?

The King of the 
Dinosaurs has also been one of the most recognizable and favorited Prehistoric Creatures ever since it was first discovered by Barnum Brown back in 1902. Because of this, the 
massive carnivorous titan became a clear target for John Hammond to recreate in his ambitious tourist attraction that would be named, Jurassic Park. Hammond's theme park was built 
with this star attraction in mind and its likeness was placed on every possible area that it could be on the island. Even the logo for InGen's project would proudly feature a Tyrannosaur
with the park's title, symbolizing how grand the Jurassic Experience would trully be.

Now with Every T Rex in Jurassic Park being listed here we have to include the Jurassic World Tyrannosaurus Rexy because its the same Jurassic Park Rexy from the first movie. Now T-rexes can get mixed up sometimes but Rexy is different from the JP3 T-rex and the Infant Tyrannosaurus from The Lost World San Diego in JP History. Maybe someday we will see Baby Rexy in a film and it will give new meaning to the Jurassic Park Breakout in the first movie. Either way good tags like The Lost World Infant Tyrannosaurus as well as the incredible Bull T-rex need to be utilized to rank. In my opinion, The Lost World T-rex scene is really cool but the Jurassic Park Tyrannosaurus scenes are cool too even if they spell its name Tyranosaurus on the Embryo chamber but whatever the Jurassic Park Breakout is still cool and Jurassic World Rexy is too! Sometimes The Lost World Baby T-rex gets typed into a fragmented sentence within a YouTube Description...interesting. That Infant Tyrannosaurus is just as cool as the Thrasher Tyrannosaurus and it has a great Jurassic Park Ending as well. :D",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nUJ4HC4vK6g/sddefault.jpg,0.016334370744991247,0.00048020813071386885,34.01518987341772,0.002433865006808014,0.016814578875705116,0.019248443882513133,2018-01-11,04:25:30,Thursday,3,8,70,8,36,44,531,1,74,0,3,6,57,2,2,5.0,7.0,"['ial', '', 'Sparen']","['ial', 'Sparen']",True,"['ial', 'sparen']",2,2,9,0,0,0,0,4.9759794722284685,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

He‚Äôs sold more than 172 million albums, topped charts all around the globe and ranked 83rd of Rolling Stones Greatest artists of all time! It wasn‚Äôt an easy road to fame for him, as you‚Äôll discover in some of our incredible facts today!

Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr

19 - Name Change‚Ä¶ 
The Marshall Mathers LP was Eminem‚Äôs 3rd studio album, and it was meant to be called Amsterdam. The reason being that he wrote most of the album there, and he said Dutch journalists inspired some of the lyrics in the album.  

18 - Battle It Out‚Ä¶
If you‚Äôd like to be signed to Shady Records, which is his own record label, be prepared to do a rap battle with him! Good luck! 

17 - Good decision‚Ä¶ 
As mentioned already, the track Lose Myself, off the movie 8 Mile, won an Oscar ‚Äì but Universal and Interscope were keen to have ‚ÄòCleanin Out My Closet‚Äô as the main song from the movie. Eminem disagreed, and it was definitely the best decision. 

 
16 - Believe in yourself‚Ä¶ 
Just goes to show, you don‚Äôt have to be an excellent scholar to be a success in life. Just do your best! Marshall failed 9th grade 3 times, and he turned out more than ok! 

 
15 - Pay it forward‚Ä¶
Eminem believes in giving back, and despite his own personal issue ‚Äì he‚Äôs managed to establish charitable foundations and he supports various charities. He has started a few of his own charities, but doesn‚Äôt like to get credit for the work he does there. 

14 - Love at first sight‚Ä¶ 
The first time he met Kim, she was just 13 and he was 15. He was standing on a table, shirt off and rapping away to the song ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad‚Äù by LL Cool J. 


13 - Under Investigation‚Ä¶
The CIA and US Secret Service have both investigated Eminem, and saw him as a threat to national security. A lot of it had to do with the single Mosh, which referenced George Bush. 

 
12 - Money lost‚Ä¶ 
Mid November of 2017, Eminem took a bit of a knock in the financial market. He owned a beautiful mansion in Detroit, which he purchased for $4.75 million in 2003. He‚Äôs just sold it for $1.9 million, taking a huge loss on the home. This mansion came in at number 10 on the Top 10 Rappers Mansions back in 2016. It‚Äôs said that he was hardly ever at the home, and it was best to just let it go. 

11 - Term of endearment‚Ä¶ 
We may not always like our nicknames, but they‚Äôre usually coming from a place of love. Eminem used to be called Mickey, as his ears were so big! 


10 - A little spoil‚Ä¶ 
When he‚Äôs career had just started, Eminem and Royce da 5'9"" bought themselves new Avirex leather jackets. They hid the jackets under their hotel bed, as they didn‚Äôt want their manager to think they were being irresponsible with their money. 


9 - A star is born‚Ä¶ 
Eminem could have been a star on the big screen even before the release of 8 Mile. Training day was a film released in 2001, and initially the director wanted to cast Eminem in the role of Officer Jake Hoyt, but the role ended up going to Ethan Hawke. 


8 - Will the real slim shady please stand up‚Ä¶
According to Eminem, his different names represent a different side of him. Slim Shady for his temper, Eminem when he‚Äôs a rapper and Marshal Mathers, for the guy at the end of the day.  

7 - Who do you believe?
I‚Äôm leaning towards Eminem here! Eminem once mentioned that he and Mariah Carey had a brief relationship in 2001, which she of course denies‚Ä¶ but I have a hunch that he‚Äôs telling the truth. 

6 - Not to be repeated‚Ä¶ 
He is quite the catch, but Eminem has said he‚Äôs got no plans to marry or have any more children ever again. 


5 - Thank the kids‚Ä¶ 
When Dr Dre‚Äôs kids started singing along to The Real Slim Shady, that‚Äôs when Dre just knew that the song would be a hit! 

4 - A little persuasion‚Ä¶
Walk on Water is the latest offering by Eminem and it was released on the 10th of November 2017. It features Beyonce singing the chorus. Within 4-days the song had received 20-million views on YouTube. Apparently, Jay-Z was the one who encouraged Beyonce to be on the track with Eminem, and he performed it at the 2017 MTV Video Music awards with Skylar Gray. 

3 - Not going to happen‚Ä¶ 
To this day, he doesn‚Äôt know how to use a computer and isn‚Äôt going to learn. In his words, ""If I learn how to work a computer, I'm going to be on that b** all day looking at comments about me, and it's going to drive me crazy."" Wise decision, wouldn‚Äôt you agree? 

2 - Sing for the moment‚Ä¶
A study was done where 93 artists across 25 genres of music were researched to see who had the widest vocabulary. Eminem topped the list with 8,818 unique words. Jay-Z had 6,899 and Bob Dylan 4,883. 

1 - False Alarm‚Ä¶
Celebs always seem to die a few times before they actually do. It‚Äôs been falsely reported that Eminem has died in a car accident 4-times, and once from an overdose. Happy to say, he is still with us!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nVThCKvIUF4/hqdefault.jpg,0.007805270079392139,0.0007214699722371048,10.818565400843882,0.0009315181920023381,0.008526740051629244,0.009458258243631579,2017-11-20,21:00:04,Monday,0,6,66,6,60,35,528,1,127,1,0,4,1,3,7,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.786423849187588,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,{'person': 2},2

I knew as soon as I saw the BuzzFeed video Flip and I had to try this. I would encourage everyone to at least try this once. It is really important to be a leader to your dog but listening and being in the moment is just as important and this is a great exercise to really draw those to attributes out. Let me know below if you are going to try this on your next dog walk. Inspired by that one Buzzfeed video. Today I will let my dog walk me! Wherever he pleases to go, I will follow him! The only rule is if he decides to cross the street and cars come, I will step in and make sure he does not get hit by a car! I hope you enjoy!

Everyone out there thinks the Eagles won the Superbowl but the real winner is this kid who randomly broke the internet with his JT halftime moment. 

Selfie kid as he‚Äôll forever be remembered straight-up owned the internet side of the Superbowl, was all of us when he used his moment with icon Justin Timberlake to take a selfie‚Ä¶even though JT was like in the middle of the biggest performance of his entire career. 

For those of you guys and gals that missed this stellar moment, let me back this train up and paint y‚Äôall a picture. JT is literally winding down what, again, was probably the biggest/most important performance of his career, doing the halftime show at the 2018 Superbowl. At the end of his freaking show-stopping performance, he headed into the crowd to hang with the fans while he belted out his last song. This is when enters selfie kid ‚Äì his name is actually Ryan McKenna by the way. Anyways, selfie kid did what all of us would die to do, because priorities, and he snapped multiple selfies with JT, WHO FYI is the gem of the century because he literally posed for pics with the kid. Ryan told Good Morning America that it was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and that he QUOTE ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt really know‚Äù this whole thing was going to happen. Ryan did know he was sitting in a special section, but he didn‚Äôt know Justin was about to be all up in his face. 

So what about moment in the show when Ryan was literally sitting there on his phone and looked he was totally hilariously ignoring Timberlake? Welp, he said: ""I had a video going on and my phone shut off. That's why I was on my phone, And I love him because he's like my favorite singer, and I just had to get a selfie with him."" He added that ""It was definitely a great opportunity. This is insane, Like, this is crazy. I got to meet him and get a picture with him because he's awesome.""

But guys, like I mentioned, this kid still owned the internet and everyone knew when this happened that he was about to become THE super bowl meme. Here are a few faves: 
Jamie MCCarty posted this one where it looks like Ryan is searching ‚Äúwho is Justin Timberlake.‚Äù Another user posted this one where Ryan was searching the lyrics to ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Stop the Feelin‚Äô‚Äù Another fave was this one posted by the show This Is US, where it looks like he‚Äôs spending the JT performance not watching but searching ‚Äúwhat happens to Jack Pearson.‚Äù

Honestly, I love everything about this ‚Äì so funny and why the internet can be amazing. Congrats to Selfie Kid and major props to Justin Timberlake on a killer show and more importantly props to him for being so generous and making this kid‚Äôs life. What did you guys think of this funny sitch? Hit the comments to join the convo and then click here to get the breakdown of our top Justin Timberlake Superbowl performance moments. I‚Äôm your girl Joslyn Davis, thanks for hanging and we‚Äôll catch you later!

Numerous outlets have listed these two films in their lists for best films of the year. But will they be getting any awards consideration come Oscar time? And if you had to choose one over the other, which of these two films do you think deserves consideration for nominations during this awards season?

John Rocha and Emma Fyffe sit down to answer these questions with Rocha advocating for Logan and Fyffe advocating for Wonder Woman. They discuss, defend and debate their points and give you their honest analysis of why their movie should get consideration over the other for awards. It‚Äôs certainly a difficult choice to make which is what makes the discussion and debate a fun one. Let us know in the Comments section below which of these two films you think deserves consideration for awards and if you agree or disagree with what Rocha and Fyffe had to say.

In this Space Time Journal Club we look into the origins of 'Oumuamua, an asteroid visiting us from beyond our solar system! We'll focus on the results of:

""The origin of interstellar asteroidal objects like 1I/2017 U1""
Portegies Zwart, Pelupessy, Bedorf, Cai & Torres 2017
https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03558

On October 19th this year astronomers spotted an object moving rapidly away from the sun. The discovery was made by Pan-STARRS - the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System: a group of telescopes that constantly monitor the sky for moving or variable objects like asteroids or comets, It was initially thought to be a new comet, but after 34 days of follow up observations and a bit of orbital mechanics, it became abundantly clear that we were looking at the first object ever observed that came from outside our solar system. The mysterious object has been dubbed 1I: the first object in a brand new International Astronomical Union class, with ‚ÄúI‚Äù standing for ‚Äúinterstellar‚Äù. 1I also scored a more poetic name: 'Oumuamua, from the Hawaiian meaning ‚Äúa messenger from afar arriving fast‚Äù.

We know it sounds crazy, but they actually figured out a way through natural breeding to grow a tearless onion. No more crying in the kitchen! And after watching this video, a few delicious onion recipes with no tears involved.

In this video you'll see all kinds of wild things staring the onion; caramelized onion jam, beer battered donut onion rings, onion focaccia, a dank French onion soup, onion jerky, Thai onion salad, artichoke onion dip, braised onions, pickled Thai style onions.

1) Steven Spielberg Eyeing ‚ÄòIndiana Jones 5‚Ä≤, ‚ÄòWest Side Story‚Äô for His Next Movies

2) PGA Award / SAG Award winners recap

3) Box Office Report 

4) Disney's 'Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake Finds Director

5) Logan Lerman in Talks to Play a Young Dan Rather in 'Newsflash'

6) New extended trailer released for Rampage 

7) Live Twitter Questions

Deadline reports that Steven Spielberg has a number of possible projects but the filmmaker is first eyeing Disney‚Äôs untitled Indiana Jones 5 with a plan to either precede or follow with another movie soon after. That other movie might just be Spielberg‚Äôs long-time passion project, a new adaptation of West Side Story. The next Indy film has been in the works since 2015, when Lucasfilm‚Äôs Kathleen Kennedy confirmed plans were in motion for another sequel ‚Äì which is currently dated for July 10, 2020. The question now, will Spielberg move forward first on Indy 5 or West Side Story?  

PGA AWARD / SAG AWARD RESULTS

BOX OFFICE REPORT 

AGREE / DISAGREE 

THR reports that 28 Weeks Later helmer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is in negotiations to helm The Sword in the Stone, Disney's live-action reimagining of the studio's 1963 animated fantasy. Bryan Cogman, a writer-producer on Game of Thrones, wrote the script for the project, which is being produced by The Jungle Book‚Äôs Brigham Taylor. 

THR reports that Logan Lerman is in talks to play newscaster Dan Rather in the real-life drama entitled Newsflash; which will see Lerman star alongside Seth Rogen as Walter Cronkite. Stronger‚Äôs David Gordon Green will direct the movie, in a film that will recount the events of Nov. 22, 1963, as television news stations raced to report the facts of President John F. Kennedy's assassination in Texas. 

New Line Cinema debuted a new Rampage spot during its Championship Sunday football game between the Vikings and the Eagles. The film is based on the 1986 video game, and stars Dwayne Johnson as Primatologist Davis Okoye, a man who shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.

-First Solo: A Star Wars Story Reactions Hit Online

-Peter Jackson Reportedly Deciding Between a Return to Middle-Earth or a DC Superhero Movie

-Bradley Cooper Sets His Own Leonard Bernstein Movie to Duel the Gyllenhaal/Fukunaga Movie

-TriStar, Michael Sugar Team for Racial Horror Thriller 'Infidel'

The first Solo A Star Wars Story reactions have landed online after the world premiere of the movie happened last night in Hollywood, CA.

According to a report from The One Ring, Peter Jackson is deciding between a return to Middle-earth or a DC superhero flick. That means Jackson could direct or oversee a number of episodes of the Lord of the Rings series on Amazon, or he can choose to direct a DC Movie, one that is unknown at this time as far as the property is concerned.

Deadline reports that Bradley Cooper will co-write, direct, and star in a Leonard Bernstein biopic co-financed by Paramount and Amblin Entertainment, with Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg onboard as producers. That means Spielberg has opted not to direct a Bernstein movie after all, and will instead produce.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, TriStar Pictures will team up with the Oscar winning producer of Spotlight to produce the racial horror thriller entitled Infidel. The movie will be based on the horror comic from former DC/Vertigo editor Pornsak Pichetshote and artist Aaron Campbell, that is described as a haunted-house story for the 21st century.

The first trailer has been released for Searching; an upcoming thriller starring John Cho that tells the story of Cho‚Äôs missing daughter using only phone and computer screens in the narrative.  The movie also stars Debra Messing, Joseph Lee, Michelle La, and Sara Sohn, and will premiere in theaters August 3rd.

Meet Fiona. People come from all around to see this cute bundle of joy at the Cincinnati Zoo. She is named after Princess Fiona from the movie Shrek. Fiona was born prematurely and was unable to nurse on her own. She even had trouble breathing. Her lungs weren‚Äôt fully developed so the staff had to attach her to oxygen. The zookeepers had to stay with her at all hours of the day just to keep her alive. Eventually they began to introduce Fiona to the water. She loved it. As her lungs developed, she began to swim underwater. She has truly won over the hearts of many. But even though Fiona is adorable, hippos are amongst the most aggressive wild animals on the planet. It is not advised to engage with any hippos that you encounter.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndKIrjK_E4E/sddefault.jpg,0.0123959000640615,0.00012812299807815503,96.75,0.0003523382447149264,0.012524023062139652,0.01287636130685458,2018-03-22,08:35:01,Thursday,3,10,37,10,32,54,331,0,76,0,1,8,16,3,0,4.0,8.0,"['a ret', 'yN AY A', 'bee']","['a', 'ret', 'yN', 'AY', 'A', 'bee']",True,"['a', 'ret', 'yN', 'AY', 'A', 'bee']",6,6,12,0,2,1,2,6.3121623104006686,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

In this video:

‚ÄúTwin films‚Äù is the term used to describe a peculiar Hollywood phenomenon that just about every year sees different major studios releasing movies with almost identical plots and themes to their competitors current offerings. Popular examples of twin films include Deep Impact and Armageddon, two films released within weeks of one another that centred around saving the world from a giant meteor. Other popular examples include A Bug‚Äôs Life and Antz ‚Äì animated films about ants rebelling against their hive. Then there‚Äôs Dante‚Äôs Inferno and Volcano ‚Äì both of which are disaster films about volcanic eruptions. (As an idea of how common this is in Hollywood, all of these films were released between 1997 and 1998.)

In this video:

Walter Hunt is a man who is simultaneously considered to have possessed one of the finest inventive minds in all of American history while also being an individual almost no one has ever heard. This is despite the fact that it‚Äôs almost guaranteed that one of his inventions is currently lying somewhere in your home, the safety pin. This was something he sold the patent for for a few hundred dollars, reportedly as he needed the money to pay off a $15 debt. This was a theme throughout his life- inventing various items that otherwise should have made him extremely wealthy and famous, but which never did because of his proclivity to sell his patents immediately and move on to his next great invention.

It's the magical rags-to-riches tale as old as time: man mentions a sweet and humble jelly brand as a joke in a YouTube video, viewers thoroughly embrace joke, jelly brand turns out to be super cool with the whole thing, man ends up partnering with jelly brand to create his own flavor of jelly. That's right, we've officially partnered with Crofter's and Logan and Roman couldn't be happier! Hope you enjoy!!

Special thanks to Crofter's for making all of this possible!! Still can't believe it's real!! You can get your own jar of Logan's Berry jelly here!

This movie adaptation was pretty loyal to the book, but there are some differences! For this list, we‚Äôre looking at all the ways in which the film adaptation differs from its source material, ‚ÄúSimon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda‚Äù. The book‚Äôs author has said that it‚Äôs faithful to her original story, but we‚Äôll be itemizing both major and minor differences. Because we‚Äôll be delving deep into the story, there will definitely be spoilers!

Here's a list of signs that actually indicate a super bright mind. They are all scientifically proved, so if you feel like a few of them are true for you, you have every reason to call yourself a genius!

You can perfectly control yourself 3:50
Your eyes are blue 4:53

SUMMARY
- Justin Kruger and David Dunning worked with a group of Cornell University undergrads and published the results of their research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1999. They asked students to predict their scores after being tested in Humor, Logical reasoning and English Grammar. Those who were 100% sure they did outstandingly well ended up with worse results than those who were more critical of themselves. 
- Psychologist Oliver Burkeman has done some serious research on the lifestyle of the brightest minds in the world. He concluded that smart people tend to save up their mental abilities for more important things. Unless those smart people are fashion designers or Lady Gaga, of course. 
- Empathy is a sign of exceptional mental intelligence. If you are emotionally intelligent, you love meeting new people and learning new things. According to psychologist and author of Focus: The Hidden Drivers of Excellence Daniel Goleman, people who care a lot about others and can feel them well, generally, succeed in life. 
- The ability to control instincts is what we know distinguishes humans from animals. Genius people went even further: they manage to overcome and control any impulses they have. If you can plan and achieve goals without being distracted by emotions you are more intelligent than you might imagine. 
- Professor emeritus of the University of Louisville Joanne Rowe has concluded light-eyed humans, and even animals are way better at activities requiring self-pacing than the dark-eyed creatures. The fact that you are better at self-paced activities means that you like paying attention to every detail. 
- M.D. Franz H. Messerli, who is most likely a chocolate lover himself, published the results of his study in The New England Journal of Medicine. He tried to link genius (Noble prize winner kind of genius) per ten million people with the amount of chocolate consumed in certain countries. And he found it. 
- Genius people don‚Äôt stick to the past. And, they don‚Äôt blame everyone and everything around for their sadness. Psychologist Daniel Goleman explains a real genius does not only address problems but also recognizes emotions when he feels them, and not ignores them. 
- Psychologists¬†Daniel Swigley¬†and¬†Gary Lupyan¬†conducted a whole study on it. The good self-talk, according to them, helps us sort the important thoughts from useless stuff going through our minds. 
- A study conducted at the Northwestern University has stated that a genius hates any kind of background noise because it prevents him from concentrating on important issues. 
- Next time someone criticizes your handwriting, simply nod, say ‚ÄúI am sorry you don‚Äôt get it‚Äù and triumph on the inside. Messy writing is one of the signs of a genius! 

Did you recognize any of these signs in yourself, or maybe you are now positive your best friend is a genius? Feel free to share it in the comments section.

The story of three girls‚Äô rise to fame, STAR‚Äôs second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O‚ÄôGrady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE‚Äôs (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed ‚Äì with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone‚Äôs fates are finally answered.

The squid have a fascinating life history, but their story doesn't end when they die. They become food for hungry scavengers and might change the rhythm of life in the deep sea.

Egg sheets were up to 2.5 m (over 8 feet) long.

The Gulf of California lies between mainland Mexico and Baja. MBARI researchers conducted expeditions there in 2003, 2012 and 2015.

Hi there and thank you so much for stopping by! I'm Audrey, a Charleston based minimalist, antique collector and stripe lover. Through my videos and site (AudreyALaMode.com), I share my love of simplicity and my journey toward doing more with less.

From tips on how to build a classic, minimal, year-round wardrobe, to home decor and DIY's from my very own home in Charleston, my hope is that each post and video I upload will inspire you to live life to the fullest - and in style.

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

Group AOA came back with an exciting and cheerful performance. Title track ‚ÄòBingle Bangle‚Äô is a retro song influenced by modern funky pop, revealing AOA‚Äôs original healthy and bright energy. The whispering and cool guitar sounds on the strong beats are the killer parts of the song from the beginning in harmony with the addictive catchy sounds all over the song.

Hey Guys! Time for some more new music! I'm very proud to present my new single ""Lonely"" with the amazing MAX... In all the stories I wanted to share in my ""One In A Million"" album there are vibes that are uplifting and inspirational but also real. I get my energy touring all the time from the amazing fans I meet and this album is for you guys, but I also have low points like anyone else, from the industry politics, fake people or whatever that is bad and negative energy and the lyrics in the song ""Lonely"" is for them. I also think when people hear this song they will in some way connect to a story in there own meaning because every life has ups and downs, but it's always important to take the negativity and make it to something positive. I've done that with ""Lonely""!!!  - Tom

Ea urcƒÉ spre aerul rece tot mai sus, tot mai sus, tot mai sus, mai sus de nori.
Ca sƒÉ cadƒÉ-ncet apoi, sƒÉ se transforme iar √Æn mii de culori.
Ea nu poate fi ispititƒÉ de iubirea cuiva, ci doar se poate mula dacƒÉ simte.
√éncerc√¢nd s-o prind, risc s-o pierd √Æntr-un joc, √Æntr-un joc de cuvinte.

Cu mine tu e»ôti tu c√¢nd e»ôti cuminte.
E»ôti alta cu altcineva c√¢nd faci isterii.
De vinƒÉ o fi vinul cƒÉ te vƒÉd fƒÉrƒÉ ve»ôminte,
SƒÉ vinƒÉ cel ce divinƒÉ te vede. Tu-l »ôtii.

Tu e»ôti frica mea, puternicƒÉ, ad√¢ncƒÉ.
E»ôti puterea »ôi blestemul meu. Frica mea
Eu nu mƒÉ tem de tine √ÆncƒÉ
Frica mea, puternicƒÉ, ad√¢ncƒÉ.
E»ôti puterea »ôi blestemul meu. Frica mea
Eu nu mƒÉ tem de tine √ÆncƒÉ.

Deci e»ôti sigurƒÉ c-o sƒÉ te caut, dar ai dubii c-o sƒÉ te gasesc √Æn lumini de ora»ô,
Chiar dacƒÉ jocul tƒÉu ne-a fƒÉcut knockout, pƒÉcat. Eram la c√¢»õiva pa»ôi
De prƒÉpastia √Æn care-a»ô fi sƒÉrit. Eu nu eram eroic, eram doar hotƒÉr√¢t
SƒÉ accept o cƒÉdere linƒÉ »ôi-un sf√¢r»ôit. Tu vrei sƒÉ-»õi mul»õumesc cƒÉ m-ai oprit? Nu, pentru cƒÉ

Cu mine tu e»ôti tu c√¢nd e»ôti cuminte.
E»ôti alta cu altcineva c√¢nd faci isterii.
De vinƒÉ o fi vinul cƒÉ te vƒÉd fƒÉrƒÉ ve»ôminte,
SƒÉ vinƒÉ cel ce divinƒÉ te vede. Tu-l »ôtii.
Tu e»ôti frica mea, puternicƒÉ, ad√¢ncƒÉ.
E»ôti puterea »ôi blestemul meu. Frica mea
Eu nu mƒÉ tem de tine √ÆncƒÉ
Frica mea, puternicƒÉ, ad√¢ncƒÉ.
E»ôti puterea »ôi blestemul meu. Frica mea
Eu nu mƒÉ tem de tine √ÆncƒÉ.

Se zice cƒÉ nu po»õi fugi de soartƒÉ, dar eu nu cred √Æn soartƒÉ!
Eu cred cƒÉ tu √Æmi vei rupe inima, fato.
Cred cƒÉ am gre»ôit distan»õa, cred cƒÉ mi-e fricƒÉ »ôi basta.
»òi cred cƒÉ dacƒÉ trec peste asta o sƒÉ-mi rup »õeasta.
Copy paste √Æn listƒÉ alƒÉturi de fosta...

Tu e»ôti frica mea, puternicƒÉ, ad√¢ncƒÉ.
E»ôti puterea »ôi blestemul meu. Frica mea
Eu nu mƒÉ tem de tine √ÆncƒÉ
Frica mea, puternicƒÉ, ad√¢ncƒÉ.

But they don't realize they are completely wrong about universal basic income.  UBI is only designed to elevate people out of poverty, but with the current political and economic system, and artificial intelligence on the rise, we can only expect a dystopian future. 

Bitcoin: 
1C7UkndgpQqjTrUkk8pY1rRpmddwHaEEuf

This isn't a case against universal basic income per se. The problem is that universal basic income is probably going to be used by economic and political elites as a distraction from a much more sever social restructuring. With the power of the artificial intelligence within the hands of the few biggest corporations they will control and manipulate everything. It's not a conspiracy theory. They are doing it right now.

In this video, I build up on the arguments and premises laid out by AI developers and researches like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Ray Kurzweil, and Sam Harris. While Elon Musk thins universal basic income is inevitable, we still share the stance on the dangers of artificial intelligence. Where I differ is that we can't rely on the system where we can no longer earn our own income, but have to rely on the corporations and governments to sustain our living.

Justice League is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name, consisting of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, the film is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Zack Snyder with a screenplay by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, from a story by Terrio and Snyder. It features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen and J. K. Simmons. In Justice League, the superhero team forms to honor Superman following his death and to save the planet from the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons.

The film was announced in October 2014 with Snyder on board to direct and Terrio attached to write the script. Initially announced as Justice League Part One, with a second part to follow in 2019, the second film was indefinitely delayed to accommodate a standalone Batman film with Affleck. Principal photography commenced in April 2016 and ended in October 2016. Snyder then hired Joss Whedon to write scenes that would be filmed during reshoots; however, Snyder left the project in May 2017 following the death of his daughter.

Whedon was hired to oversee the remainder of post-production, including directing additional scenes written by himself. Snyder received sole director credit for the film, with Whedon receiving a screenplay credit in post. With an estimated production budget of $300 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Justice League premiered in Beijing on October 26, 2017, and was released in the United States in 2D, 3D and IMAX on November 17, 2017.

What are they used for? How do they work? How do you use crimping connectors for electrical connections? Here I take a look at electrical crimping connectors, often used in auto electrics, and set about answering all these questions.
You may have seen me using the connectors in one of my electrical related videos, maybe about switches, relays, PIDs, etc. Certainly one subscriber had ‚Äì he wrote asking very simply ‚Äúwhat are those called‚Äù and I realised this was a topic I hadn‚Äôt covered properly. So for him and anyone else interested, here I look at the most commonly used crimping connectors, the Spade, Ring, Bullet, Fork and Butt Splice, demonstrating their use and explaining their function.
Finally I look at my preferred application of crimping connectors - using a soldering iron. Yes I know that's not really the point, but it does make for a much more secure fixing.

FAQs:

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Animation is a slow process and Simon‚Äôs Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.

Q. Where can I buy Simon‚Äôs Cat merchandise?
A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://shop.simonscat.com/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nvR5ZNegmxE/sddefault.jpg,0.013036768387204445,0.0003196652633281317,40.782561894510216,0.0002763091565688804,0.013356433650532577,0.013632742807101457,2017-12-07,13:30:01,Thursday,3,8,62,8,49,45,515,3,119,2,0,3,10,0,2,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.118621403834014,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

How did we land on that concept of extraterrestrials?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

No one really knows what aliens look like, but we all have similar ideas about them. It‚Äôs often a creature with a big head, long arms and legs, and big buggy eyes. We see these common images of aliens depicted in movies, books, and on TV shows‚Äîwhich are made by us.

Science fiction stories often explore the relationship between humans and aliens. So we often find extraterrestrial creatures entangled with relatable human features. In this video, we talk to Oscar-nominated VFX supervisor Charley Henley, and the director of SETI Research Center at UC Berkely, Andrew Siemion. They both give us their views on how we, humans, perceive aliens and how that shapes our imagination of life beyond our planet.

He often makes huge hits that can classify as either clean, borderline or dirty. Most of these hits fall in the borderline or dirty hits, but not necessarily all of them are that dirty. Some of them are just massive hits. Here is a compilation of all of his biggest hits.

Lyrics used in ""Troye Sivan - The Good Side (Lyrics)""

I got the good side of things,
Left you with both of the rings,
My fingers danced,
And swayed in the breeze,
The change in the wind took you down to your knees

I got the good side of you,
Sent it out into the blue,
The people danced,
To the sound of your heart,
The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathise,
And I recognise,
And baby, I apologise,
That I got the good side,
The good side of things

I got the good side of life,
Travelled the universe twice,
So many thoughts I wanted to share,
But I didn‚Äôt call because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair

Then I got the good side of new,
Found arms to fall right into,
I know how it looked, It wasn‚Äôt the plan,
And someday I hope that you‚Äôll understand,

That I sympathise,
And I recognise,
And baby, I apologise,
That I got the good side,
The good side of things

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll meet in the spring,
And catch up on everything,
I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm proud of all that you‚Äôve done,
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

But I sympathise,
And I recognise,
And baby, I apologise,
That I got the good side,
The good side of things

Sympathise,
Recognise,
Apologise,
That I got the good side,
The good side of things

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nxQ6964BiCI/sddefault.jpg,0.01471991576083976,0.0002193728131272692,67.1,0.0009762090184163477,0.014939288573967029,0.015915497592383376,2018-03-21,08:35:01,Wednesday,2,8,37,7,32,47,331,1,76,0,1,8,16,3,0,5.0,8.0,['ROOSFVELT'],['ROOSFVELT'],True,['roosfvelt'],1,1,9,0,0,0,0,6.200285647434358,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Die Informatik l√∂st formale (mathematisch modellierte) Probleme ganz vorz√ºglich ‚Äì doch nun soll sie alle anderen Probleme auch noch l√∂sen.

Die Informatik ist scheinbar das neue G√∂ttliche, das den Klimawandel, die Kriminalit√§t, unser fehlendes Wissen √ºber das Gehirn, den globalen Terror, dichter werdenden Stadtverkehr, die Energieprobleme und die Armut der Welt l√∂sen kann; und zwar mit der Blockchain, mit k√ºnstlicher Intelligenz, mit der Cloud und mit
Big-Data. Doch inwiefern ist die Informatik √ºberhaupt in der Lage, derartige Probleme hoher gesellschaftlicher Relevanz anzugehen? In diesem Vortrag soll versucht werden, Teile der riesigen Wunschliste an die Informatik mit ihren tats√§chlichen aktuellen M√∂glichkeiten in Einklang zu bringen sowie die √∂konomischen Motivationen und Rahmenbedingungen einzubeziehen.

VERSE1:
How I live for the moments
Where I‚Äôm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can‚Äôt miss a thing

PRE-CHORUS:
Lord I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all

CHORUS:
All I want is to live within Your love 
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

VERSE 2:
You‚Äôre the fire in the morning
You‚Äôre the cool in the evening 
The breath in my soul
The life in my bones
There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It‚Äôs the sweetest of all

BRIDGE:
I open up my heart to You
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can 
Jesus have Your way in me now

Finally I even show you what an electron orbital really means.

Lyrics:
Every day‚Äôs a blur
Sometimes I can‚Äôt tell what day it is
Don‚Äôt know what day it is
Can you tell me what day it is?
Life‚Äôs passing by
Cause I‚Äôm out chasing empty highs
Every hello means goodbye
But I‚Äôm looking for more this time
¬†
Can we start to slow it down?
Can we learn to live to right now?
I just want to feel it all
¬†
I‚Äôm a Ferrari
Pulled off on Mulholland drive
Over the city the lights are so pretty from up here
I‚Äôm a Ferrari
After the party‚Äôs done
I keep on going missing the moments
Living in the fast lane‚Äôs getting kinda lonely, yeah
Living in the fast lane‚Äôs getting kinda lonely
Living in the fast lane‚Äôs getting kinda lonely
¬†
Got a heavy heart
Cause it‚Äôs still beating on its own
Might be going out in the crowd
But I‚Äôm still coming home alone
Not trying to say
I‚Äôm not grateful for everything
I‚Äôm just going too fast to see
All the good things in front of me
¬†
I‚Äôm a Ferrari
Pulled off on Mulholland drive
Over the city the lights are so pretty from up here
I‚Äôm a Ferrari
After the party‚Äôs done
I keep on going missing the moments
Living in the fast lane‚Äôs kinda lonely, yeah",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nyRawESIuy4/sddefault.jpg,0.010983325484242737,0.0004001433937855397,27.448473859171955,0.00047203376779747774,0.011383468878028276,0.011855502645825754,2018-04-27,13:57:45,Friday,4,6,34,6,33,37,265,3,63,0,1,5,12,0,2,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.4772886889652215,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

LETRA: 

Yo' Grace
Yo no s√© si t√∫ me quiere' 
Pero a m√≠ me va y me viene 
Porque yo te quiero para m√≠ solita 
No quiero sonar intensa 
Pero dime si me piensas 
Porque yo te quiero para m√≠ solita

Miento, si digo que no siento cosquillitas 
Cuando me miras, mi mundo gira, pa'tra', pa'tra', pa'tra'

Dale suave, que me duela 
Cada vez que la boca me muerde
Dame besos de m√°s 
B√©same como si el mundo se fuera a acabar

Dale duro, que me gusta 
Dale sin miedo que a m√≠ no me asusta 
Dale duro y suave, que nadie sabe 
Lo que entre t√∫ y yo va a pasar

Woah oh oh oh oh (Dame, dame, dame)
Dame besitos de m√°s (ah, No-No-Noriel) 
Woah oh oh oh oh (Dame, dame, dame)
Como si el mundo se fuera a acabar

Baby t√∫ eres medio indecisa 
Te gusta lento, pero con prisa 
Suave, cuando vaya a terminar me avisa' 
Entre el humo, el alcohol y la risa 
Ma' yo tengo el poder, pa' ver como t√∫ cuerpo se te eriza (ah, ah, ah) 
T√∫ en mi ya marcaste una huella 
Y es que por ti, baby, el pacto se sella 
T√∫ y yo solos, y un par de botellas 
Yo no voy a amarte, pero t√∫ eres mi p-(¬°ay!) y yo soy tu estrella 
Con la combi entera Phillip Plein (oh-oh-oh) 
T√∫ eres mi Victoria Secret y yo tu modelo de Calvin Klein 
Yo nunca me bajo de un airplane 
Pero no te preocupes que cuando terminemos vamo' a hacerlo again

Miento, si digo que no siento cosquillitas 
Cuando me miras, mi mundo gira, pa'tra', pa'tra', pa'tra'

Dale suave, que me duela 
Cada vez que la boca me muerde
Dame besos de m√°s 
B√©same como si el mundo se fuera a acabar

Dale duro, que me gusta 
Dale sin miedo que a m√≠ no me asusta 
Dale duro y suave, que nadie sabe 
Lo que entre t√∫ y yo va a pasar

Woah oh oh oh oh (Dame, dame, dame)
Dame besitos de m√°s
Woah oh oh oh oh (Dame, dame, dame)
Como si el mundo se fuera a acabar 
Woah oh oh oh oh (Dame, dame, dame)
Dame besitos de m√°s
Woah oh oh oh oh (Dame, dame, dame)
Como si el mundo se fuera a acabar

Miento, si digo que no siento cosquillitas 
Cuando me miras, mi mundo gira, pa'tra', pa'tra', pa'tra'

Dale suave, que me duela 
Cada vez que la boca me muerde
Dame besos de m√°s 
B√©same como si el mundo se fuera a acabar

Dale duro, que me gusta 
Dale sin miedo que a m√≠ no me asusta 
Dale duro y suave, que nadie sabe 
Lo que entre t√∫ y yo va a pasar

Ah, No-No-Noriel 
Dame besitos de m√°s 
Con esta les cambiamo' el juego, ¬°woo! 
Como si el mundo se fuera a acabar (D√≠melo Leslie)
Woah oh oh oh oh (MPC The Monster)
Woah oh oh oh oh
Como si el mundo se fuera a acabar

1) Chris Pratt's 'Cowboy Ninja Viking' Finds Its Director in Michelle MacLaren

2) ‚ÄòSolo: A Star Wars Story‚Äò likely to drop first trailer at Super Bowl

3) ‚ÄòBad Boys for Life‚Äô Lands New Directors; Eyes August Start Date

4) ‚ÄòFantastic Beasts‚Äô Sequel Will Flake on Dumbledore‚Äôs Homosexuality

5) ‚ÄòThe Passion of the Christ‚Äô Sequel: Jim Caviezel in Talks for His Second Coming

6) First ‚ÄòHereditary‚Äô Trailer Reveals A24‚Äôs Buzzy Sundance Horror Hit

7) Live Twitter Questions

Variety reports that Michelle MacLaren, best known for her work on Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, has signed on to direct Chris Pratt in Universal‚Äôs Cowboy Ninja Viking. The movie based on the Image Comics title tells of a counter-intelligence unit that uses multiple personality disorder patients to create agents known as Triplets, referring to their three personalities. 

This Sunday, February 4th during the Super Bowl ‚Äì Solo: A Star Wars Story will drop its very first trailer, this according to The Hollywood Reporter; though the trade does say that Disney has declined to comment. This will be the very first look at the movie, which has yet to share anything such as a trailer or official image from the troubled production.

Bad Boys 3, officially titled Bad Boys for Life, has found new life with Deadline reporting that the directing duo of Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah are in talks to direct. Joe Carnahan was originally attached to direct but eventually dropped off. The third movie in the franchise will see Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett.

About ten years ago, J.K. Rowling revealed to her legions of fans that Albus Dumbledore was in fact gay, and specifically had a love affair in his youth with a wizard that later turned evil: Gellert Grindelwald. Now in a new interview with EW, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald director David Yates revealed they will not be touching on this backstory in the new movie. 

It‚Äôs been almost 15 years since Mel Gibson‚Äòs Oscar-nominated picture The Passion of the Christ appeared on screens. Now, the Second Coming of Jim Caviezel‚Äòs Jesus Christ is in the making. EW has confirmed that Caviezel is in talks for to return as Jesus in Mel Gibson‚Äôs follow up, in a story that will be based on the resurrection.

A24‚Äôs twisted horror drama Hereditary earned rave reviews out of Sundance earlier this month and now, the first trailer for the film has landed online. The movie stars Toni Collette as a woman processing the recent death of her difficult mother when strange occurrences transform the grieving process into a terrifying nightmare.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o0Rn_ihE3hg/sddefault.jpg,0.01593198236071312,0.0005169100362051512,30.821576763485478,0.0007914514662228248,0.016448892396918272,0.0172403438631411,2018-02-23,06:17:47,Friday,4,9,38,9,33,51,334,2,79,0,1,9,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.743011763014251,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Technologists and politicians are proposing solutions like universal basic income and job retraining to keep job displacement from leading to poverty and homelessness. While many see the coming problems, there is little agreement on how to fund them, and few doubt the degree of expected change. 

AJ+'s documentary series on automation explores how advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning and automated vehicles will affect jobs, cities and inequality. From trucking to radiology, new technology is already changing white collar and blue collar occupations, reshaping cities and concentrating wealth in the hands of the few. Robots are taking over the world as companies like Tesla, Amazon, Uber and Google are using robots to automate.

1)    In Biopics, can the actor sometimes overplay the character of the real life person? 

2)    Hey guys, if you had the opportunity to write or direct a DC, Marvel or independent comic title as a film (that hasn‚Äôt been done), which would it be?

3)    It‚Äôs often discussed how a film sets its tone, usually in the early moments of the film. Which are your guys favorite examples of this.

4)    I was wondering if the Red Skull would return in ‚ÄòAvengers: Infinity War‚Äô.  Before being sucked up into the universe by the tesseract in ‚ÄòCaptain America: The First Avenger‚Äô, Red Skull stated ‚ÄúI have seen the future Captain.  There are no flags‚Äù referring to Cap‚Äôs star spangled uniform.  Do you think this was a statement made of things to come now that Steve no longer wears the uniform and a possibility of a Red Skull return in Infinity War?  

5)    I believe that 2017 was one of the best years in film of all time, especially for Indie films. What are some of your most anticipated Indie films coming out in 2018?

* Click SHOW MORE for all the info & what I wore! *  
________________________________________¬≠___________________ 

We decided to go for the Sherbourne range in a Stone Grey finish with Lattice handles combined with mirrored doors.
 
The buttoned seat pad in Pastiche Slub Chalk fabric and the interiors were a mixture of shelving, long hanging, double hanging and single hanging.

We would not recommend Sharps enough, they were truly fabulous from start to finish and the whole process in total took around 3 weeks with the building of the walk in wardrobe only taking 3 days! 

If you are thinking about doing the same thing and love what we chose you can find more info at Sharps.co.uk - http://bit.ly/2pAqHwc

I've been playing a lot of BOTW lately, and the system is a pretty solid console experience. Of course, as tradition around here, I just had to customize it, so here's a video about it. I had fun putting all the accessories and modifications together and I think it looks really nice.

Modifications/Accessories:
-Traveler Deluxe System Case
-J&T Wired Pro Controller
-Extra Joy-Con Pair
-Joystick Caps
-D-Pad Mod
-Multicolored ABXY Buttons
-Shell Swaps
-Joy-Con Firmware Hacks
-128GB SD Card
-Nyko Dock Bands
-Tempered Glass Screen Protector

As a warning, try to stay away from Nyko products as much as possible. The Dock bands were okay, but are still made from very cheap, low quality plastic. I got them mostly because they provide a little more protection and they add to the look of my system. I've heard very negative things about their other products like the metal kickstand and docking solutions. From other people's reviews, the metal kickstand ruins the plastic locking mechanism, so you won't be able to go back to the stock stand once you switch. Luckily, I didn't buy it, but keep that in mind as a friendly reminder!

But which ingredients make for the perfect stuffed pizza? Andrew Rea‚Äîthe mastermind behind the wildly popular cooking channel, Binging with Babish‚Äîis here to face off against Sean Evans in a calzone cook-off for the ages. That's right, it's the season sendoff you've been praying for. In typical Binging with Babish fashion, Andrew whips up a Seinfeld-inspired pizza pocket, filled to the brim with the kind of cheese, pepperoni, and eggplant wolfed down by George Costanza. It's a difficult dish to beat, but Sean has an unlikely ace up his sleeve‚Äîa calzone clone of one of America's favorite Tex-Mex meals: The Cruchwrap Supreme. Will Andrew's sitcom special be enough to impress legendary pizza man Mark Iacono, or will Sean break his losing streak and finally bring home a W from Lucali? Find out on the very special, Season 2 finale of Sean in the Wild.

‚ÄòStar Wars: The Last Jedi‚Äô directed by Rian Johnson and starring Daisy Ridley, Andy Serkis, Gwendoline Christie, Domhnall Gleeson, Mark Hamill, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran comes out on December 15th. There were so many events in ‚ÄòThe Last Jedi‚Äô that led to an incredible, franchise changing ending. Jedi Council‚Äôs Kristian Harloff and Ken Napzok have already seen the movie more than once and are here to give you their thoughts on what they thought about the ending of the movie. They explore what the next steps might be for the characters in the film. They look at what we might expect to see in terms of new planets and new/old or returning characters. Also, they give you their predictions for what we can expect to see story wise in Episode IX and if there‚Äôs anything in the media (books, comics, video games) that might be used as a guide.

Most of you have your own thoughts on where the franchise might be going from here. See if what you thought after the movies lines up with Kristian and Ken‚Äôs thoughts or let us know if you have different ideas about it below.

This video shows you how to break down a small section of a tuna loin for sushi applications. Typically, restaurants will buy a whole tuna or only the quartered sections. But for home use, there's no need to buy an entire tuna loin. The same technique can be used on all tunas: Yellowfin, Bluefin, Bigeye, and Blackfin tuna. 

When you're buying tuna loin for sushi, make sure to look for that bright deep red vibrant color. Fresh tuna should not be brown or dull looking. Also, it's important to ask your fishmonger to remove the skin and the bloodline since these parts won't be used.

DID YOU TAKE A WRONG TURN TO PASS ME BY
OR DID YOU MEAN TO WALK PAST AND CATCH MY EYE
COS YOU WERE ACTING KINDA SHY
THEN I TOOK A CHANCE AND ASKED YOU OUT
FOR A MONTH
WE CIRCLED ROUNDABOUTS
I WAS FALLING FASTER
THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT

SO LAST NIGHT WHEN I SAW YOU OUT
IN ANOTHER MAN‚ÄôS ARMS
IT CUT LIKE A KNIFE

NOW I‚ÄôM STANDING HERE ALONE
ON THE STREET WHERE WE FIRST MET
I‚ÄôM FALLING DEEPER TRYIN‚Äô TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD
STARING AT MY PHONE
HOPING SOMEDAY YOU‚ÄôLL CALL IT
I ONLY KNEW I LOVED YOU WHEN I WATCHED YOU GO

LOOKING BACK I WONDER DID I TRY
TRY ENOUGH OR WAS I PETRIFIED
TO SAY WHAT WAS RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND?
IT AIN‚ÄôT EASY ACTING LIKE I‚ÄôM FINE
YEAH IT TEARS ME UP HE'S HOLDING YOU TONIGHT
DID I LET YOU PASS ME BY

COS THAT NIGHT WHEN I SAW YOU OUT
IN ANOTHER MAN‚ÄôS ARMS
IT CUT LIKE A KNIFE

NOW I‚ÄôM STANDING HERE ALONE
ON THE STREET WHERE WE FIRST MET
I‚ÄôM FALLING DEEPER TRYIN‚Äô TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD
STARING AT MY PHONE
HOPING SOMEDAY YOU‚ÄôLL CALL IT
I ONLY KNEW I LOVED YOU WHEN I WATCHED YOU GO

NOW I‚ÄôM STANDING HERE ALONE
ON THE STREET WHERE WE FIRST MET
I‚ÄôM FALLING DEEPER TRYIN‚Äô TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD
STARING AT MY PHONE
HOPING SOMEDAY YOU‚ÄôLL CALL IT
I ONLY KNEW I LOVED YOU WHEN I WATCHED YOU GO

I ONLY KNEW I LOVED YOU WHEN I WATCHED YOU GO

WASN‚ÄôT EASY ACTING LIKE I WAS FINE
FOR A YEAR IT TORE ME UP INSIDE
BUT I STILL THINK OF YOU SOMETIMES

NOW I‚ÄôM STANDING HERE ALONE
ON THE STREET WHERE WE FIRST MET
I‚ÄôM FALLING DEEPER TRYIN‚Äô TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD
STARING AT MY PHONE
HOPING SOMEDAY YOU‚ÄôLL CALL IT
I ONLY KNEW I LOVED YOU WHEN I WATCHED YOU GO

NOW I‚ÄôM STANDING HERE ALONE
ON THE STREET WHERE WE FIRST MET
I‚ÄôM FALLING DEEPER TRYIN‚Äô TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD

Every time I go into the store I see people do the MOST with the testers and I would never even touch them tbh. I was actually shocked at my pink eye invulnerability while filming this video LOL but seriously I took as many precautions as I could and was cleaning using the alcohol to sterilize each product.  I don't recommend using the eye products, but hey ANYTHING 4 VIEWS!

You always hurt the ones you love
That's why I had to twist the blade
Goodbyes ain't my forte

I'll never meet a boy like you

Would designate us someone new

White as the rap sheet of a dove
This is the way you switched the blade
You always hurt the ones you love

The story of three girls‚Äô rise to fame, STAR‚Äôs second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O‚ÄôGrady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE‚Äôs (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed ‚Äì with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone‚Äôs fates are finally answered.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7b6LxBOCL0/sddefault.jpg,0.05928363867392958,0.0004009873662941477,147.84415584415584,-5.207628133690229e-06,0.059684626040223725,0.05967941841209003,2018-02-22,17:43:58,Thursday,3,8,25,8,20,43,218,2,37,1,1,5,21,3,3,4.0,8.0,"['A re (ih ‚Äô', '', 'an']","['A', 're', '(ih', '‚Äô', 'an']",True,"['A', 're', '(', 'ih', '‚Äô', 'an']",6,6,9,1,1,1,3,6.862476106194405,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,"{'tv': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Sometimes it‚Äôs so easy to get excited about a wedding that we completely forget that it‚Äôs the beginning of a marriage. Meghan Markle has gone through a divorce before, and both she and Prince Harry‚Äôs parents have experienced one. Find out what effect that could have on their impending marriage. We‚Äôll look at the statistics of love, marriage, and divorce, and let you in on some reasons why this attractive couple could be in serious trouble. But there are many people who believe that Meghan and Harry are meant to be, and these two definitely have a lot going for them. They have the support of the royal family, and that alone could be enough to keep them from experiencing a split. After hearing all of the evidence, be sure to let us know whether or not you think these two will stay together in the comment section.

Now, it is used as a facility for the civil commitment of the state‚Äôs most violent sex offenders. 

Residents wind up on McNeil when their prison terms have ended but a judge deems them still too dangerous for society. They‚Äôre placed indefinitely in what‚Äôs known as civil commitment ‚Äî where in theory they‚Äôll be treated until they no longer pose a threat. This could be a month or it could be forever. 

It‚Äôs not an island paradise but it‚Äôs not a prison. VICE New Tonight sees what life is like for the residents.

DOWNLOAD THE STARDUST APP AND FOLLOW JOHN  https://stardust.app.link/JohnCampea

MrYazMan3000 - Recently I read an article that Amazon will spend 500 million dollars on their Lord of the Rings TV show (this also includes the 250 million dollars that they spent to gain the rights) thus making it the most expensive TV show ever made. Do you think the show will be successful enough to recoup its budget? I don't think it will, even if the shows turns out to be good.

Gourav - Why was the box office opening of the Mummy panned off as disastrous, whereas Pacific Rim Uprising, coming off a much more recent sequel and a higher budget, is being labelled a 'US disappointment'.

Jessica Millan - I guess it‚Äôs official now that Black Panther is the all time #1 domestic box office comic book movie of all time as it just passed The Avengers.

If you are a real Potterhead, you have probably read some of the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling before the movies came out. This is how you had the chance to imagine what Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, and Severus Snape looked like. And you know that the actors don‚Äôt look exactly the same in the movies. This is why we are showing you how the cast of Harry Potter should have really looked.

If you met the golden trio in the books, you probably noticed some mistakes in the movies. For example, Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter, doesn‚Äôt have green eyes and dark black hair. Emma Watson was also a little too beautiful for this role as she didn‚Äôt have large teeth. And the only thing that Rupert Grint, who plays Ron, was missing was some freckles.

Severus Snape was one of the most terrifying characters but also one of the men that we loved the most. In the books, he had greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and shallow skin. Even though Alan Rickman was much older than him, we didn‚Äôt think that any actor could have been better than him. After all this time, we will always remember him as one of the greatest men in the Harry Potter series.

Stay tuned to hear more about characters like Albus Dumbledore, Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, Remus Lupin, Draco Malfoy, Dolores Umbridge, Severus Black, Rubeus Hagrid, and more. So which of these characters was your favorite? Don‚Äôt be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think!

The director created the illusion with a popular Hollywood technique ‚Äî¬†actually spinning the room.

Lyrics:
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?
We'll say, No man
But you can do the job while you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Ah yay, winter wonderland
Oh yeah, winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman (in the meadow we can build a snowman)
And pretend that he's a circus clown (and pretend that he's a circus clown)
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down
Sleigh bells ring (sleigh bells ring), are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We're walking in a winter wonderland, wonderland

Since there's multiple Elizas, I thought I'd interpret it as a recurring nightmare that Alexander has during the time when Eliza leaves him to stay with her parents and children. (According to Wikipedia, she did this before slowly reconciling with Alexander again.)

ANYWAYS, part of me wishes I could have spent more time on it BUT I have a lot of other things I'd like to work on, so this is all I can muster for now.

Versuri:

Feli

Nu »ôtiu cum a fƒÉcut
Sau cine a vrut sƒÉ facƒÉ primul pas
√éncƒÉ de la √Ænceput, a dat-o din gre»ôealƒÉ in vals, vals, vals...

M-a lƒÉsat sƒÉ conduc, fƒÉrƒÉ sƒÉ »ôtim de urmƒÉtorul pas
1,2,3, st√¢ng, drept, st√¢ng, a dat-o din gre»ôealƒÉ in vals, vals, vals...
Vals, vals, vals....

Chiar »ôi c√¢nd ne-am oprit, noi mereu ne-am regƒÉsit
Dar c√¢nd n-aud muzica, mƒÉ omoarƒÉ lini»ôtea!

Refren

Dans√¢nd cu ea, numai cu ea, mi-am auzit inima cum c√¢nta.
C√¢nd mƒÉ privea, lumea era doar o orchestrƒÉ ce ne acompania.
Dans√¢nd cu ea, numai cu ea, mi-am auzit inima cum c√¢nta.
C√¢nd mƒÉ privea, lumea era doar o orchestrƒÉ ce ne acompania.

Smiley:

Am mai »ôi cƒÉlcat str√¢mb,
Nu-i nimic cƒÉ doar noi vom observa
»òi √Æntregul PƒÉm√¢nt este doar un ring de dans, dans, dans.

Unul suflet »ôi trup
O pereche √Æn tot cu adevƒÉrat!
Totul a √Ænceput cƒÉ am dat-o din gre»ôealƒÉ √Æn vals, vals, vals.
Vals, vals, vals....
Vals, vals, vals....

Chiar »ôi c√¢nd ne-am oprit, noi mereu ne-am regƒÉsit
Dar c√¢nd n-aud muzica, mƒÉ omoarƒÉ lini»ôtea!

Graeme Obree shot to fame in the early 90s after twice breaking the world hour record on a bike he'd built using parts from an old washing machine.

The debate has never been settled on whether the success of this mercurial Scottish cyclist came from his cycling position or his athleticism. Until now.

Endura brings Obree to the wind tunnel and tests the real advantage or otherwise of his crouch and superman positions, which were subsequently banned by the UCI.

Today I am going to be doing FIVE ""Squishy Makeovers."" I used very cheap squishies from Banggood.com which is an Asian website that is great for getting affordable squishies.

Of course, these very cheap squishies have a lot of imperfections (which is expected), so I decided to try to fix them!  I have had this idea for the longest time, I am so excited to finally be doing this. I had a blast making this video, I hope you enjoy it! 

*Let me know if you liked the squishies better BEFORE or AFTER*

UPDATES:
‚ÄìI have been doing a lot of squishy videos recently, which is great (I plan on making MANY more), but next week I will be taking a break from squishies and going back to Create This Book :)

I don't often get my mtb fails on camera so I'm glad I had some good angles of this!!! 

I was riding the trail with Cedric Gracia while shooting for Eurosport which is TV channel focusing on sports, so this series will be out sometime in the year!!

We were shooting on GoPro session cameras!!

Electric skateboards are getting more popular each day. Finally got one. Here's my experience with it...

Here is a link to a proper electric skateboard I own:
https://backfireboards.com?ref=PWiuoE3AFjbs

Although electric skateboarding has nothing to do with pure skateboarding it was still a lot of fun to ride around on it. It really is more of a new way to commute. I rode all the way from my local park to the centre of amsterdam on it. It goes pretty fast and it was definitely a lot more fun than my regular bycicle.

Thanks to Enskate for sending me this!

Serena Williams has been nothing short of ecstatic when it comes to sharing every aspect of her life as a new mom. The only thing that can even come close to matching that excitement? Apparently, it's Gigi Hadid.

In her first public appearance since giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. on September 1, Williams stepped out at Glamour's 2017 Women of the Year Awards to introduce honoree Hadid. ""Gigi, you're one of the few people on this planet I would leave my baby for one night,"" the tennis champ told the packed crowd at Brooklyn's Kings Theatre on Monday night.

The feeling, naturally, is mutual. ""Serena, I just want to say you have been such a beautiful light in my life for so many years, and I can't tell you how happy I am to call you my friend."" Hadid said after she took the stage to accept her award. ""I love you so much, so thank you.""

 ABOUT FOR HONOR:
 Carve a path of destruction through the battlefield fighting for guts, glory, and survival in For Honor, a new melee action game developed by Ubisoft Montreal in collaboration with other Ubisoft studios.

 Enter the chaos of a raging war as a Knight, Viking, or Samurai, three of the greatest warrior legacies. For Honor is a fast-paced and immersive experience, mixing skill with visceral, never-before-seen melee combat.

 The Art of Battle, the game‚Äôs innovative control system, puts you in total control of your heroes, each with distinct skills and weapons, as you annihilate all soldiers, archers, and opposing heroes who stand in your way on an intense, believable battleground.

 For Honor offers an engaging campaign and thrilling multiplayer. Enjoy the full experience with friends online, in split screen two-player co-op, or solo against AI.

 Key Features:

 UNIQUE WARRIORS TO MASTER
 Choose your favorite warrior among a variety of unique heroes including deadly Knights, brutal Vikings, and cold-blooded Samurai. Able to turn the tide of battle and make their faction victorious, each hero comes with his or her own weapon set and combat style. Express your personality and inspire fear in your enemies by customizing each facet of your warrior, including your chest, shoulders, helmet, and weapon.

 MEMORABLE STORY CAMPAIGN
 The memorable story campaign is a tale of warriors in which you will embody heroes of all three factions. Storming castles and fortresses, making the difference in massive battles, and confronting deadly bosses in intense duels, you will need all your wits and skills to ensure the survival of your people and foil the plans of the merciless and bloodthirsty warlord, Apollyon.

 GROUNDBREAKING MULTIPLAYER
 The groundbreaking multiplayer modes will test your skill and take your adrenaline to the next level. In the heart of battle with your band of warriors, coordination and communication will be the keys to victory as you support your allies, slaughter enemies, and own the battlefield.

 INNOVATIVE ART OF BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM
 Wield the weight of your weapon and feel the power and impact of every strike. Precise and accessible, the Art of Battle system has been designed with the objective of putting you in total control of your combat moves.

The term Jediism probably conjures up thoughts of Star Wars, lightsabers and the force in a galaxy, far far away. But for some, it's a religion, with more than 500,000 members worldwide. The founder of Jediism, Daniel Jones, and fellow Jedi, Theresa Cheung, join Good Morning Britain to debate why Jediism should be considered a religion.

Lyrics:
Treating you well, but I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can be your friend
Yes, my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle
My hands are tired, but not tired enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I‚Äôm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can‚Äôt change you and I won‚Äôt change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I‚Äôm on my way tonight

Let‚Äôs be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes my shirt, and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood hurts too much and we flatline
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now we're all messed up and it feels like the first time
My hands are tired, but not tired enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I‚Äôm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can‚Äôt change you and I won‚Äôt change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I‚Äôm on my way tonight

Let‚Äôs be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let‚Äôs be lonely together
A little less lonely together

My hands are tired, but not tired enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I‚Äôm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can‚Äôt change you and I won‚Äôt change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I‚Äôm on my way tonight
Let‚Äôs be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let‚Äôs be lonely together
A little less lonely together

We dive into the aspects of the Falcon 9 and how the company and products are gearing up for the Falcon Heavy Launch SOON!

Share: https://youtu.be/oP6I0Ih_81s

SpaceX just recently had their static fire of the Falcon Heavy rocket. All 27 Merlin 1D engines roaring to life! Just listen to that sound. This machine, putting out more than 5 million pounds of thrust is going to put twice the payload of the shuttle into orbit and will be the most powerful rocket in operation.
Let‚Äôs explore what makes SpaceX and the Falcon Heavy rocket so important for the future of Space Travel!
Falcon Heavy sits on pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida with its special cargo, Elon Musk‚Äôs personal Tesla Roadster. This is considered dummy cargo as the first rocket is merely a proof of concept. If all goes to plan, the roadster, playing the song ‚Äúspace oddity‚Äù is headed for an orbit around the sun to mimic Mars where it will hopefully stay for millions of years‚Ä¶ maybe for someone else to find.
Elon Musk has stated that the sole ambition of SpaceX is to further the technology to both reach and develop a colony on Mars. Recently, the Falcon 9 Rocket has been wildly successful for both SpaceX and the U.S. Government. So, the next logical step is to build a larger rocket for proving future technological advancements in rocket design to get us to the rusty planet.

Ten years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film‚Äôs original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open in Summer 2018.
 
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.
 
Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award¬Æ winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Oscar¬Æ winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie‚Äôs three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway‚Äôs Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oS2r1zpqrQQ/sddefault.jpg,0.0006565589866981043,7.247380474590683e-05,9.059259259259257,5.583167180425416e-05,0.000729032791444011,0.0007848644632482652,2018-01-25,08:30:04,Thursday,3,11,53,11,53,73,452,3,86,1,0,10,53,3,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.784841541123508,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'boat': 1, 'person': 11}",12

Lauren and Madison Rae Margraves described their encounters with Nassar before their father, Randall Margraves, tried to attack Nassar in the courtroom. 
Margraves asked for ""five minutes"" alone with Nassar. The judge said she couldn't allow that. He asked for one minute, and she again declined.
Margraves then lunged at Nassar, who was sitting nearby.
Margraves was restrained by sheriff's deputies and hauled out of court. He returned a few hours later to apologize to Judge Janice Cunningham, who said there was ""no way"" she would punish him under her contempt of court powers. She noted the anguish felt by families over Nassar's crimes.
The incident occurred during the third and final sentencing hearing for Nassar on assault charges.

oTcwQEjy8TU,3UoKswz6OQc,The Walking Dead: 8x08 (CARL CENTRIC) Live Reaction + Thoughts,briatthedisco,24.0,2017-12-11 06:42:06+00:00,"['the walking dead', 'carl grimes', 'chandler riggs', 'death', 'scene', 'bit', 'bite', 'season 8', 'reaction']",153997.0,-1.0,-1.0,992.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTcwQEjy8TU/default.jpg,"If you know anything about me/my channel, you know that Carl is my favorite character. Not only on this show, but as a character in general. Even through all of the unwarranted hate he received, I championed for this character because he's so underrated and a true soldier. He was the future. He was a freaking badass, I don't care what anyone says. He was robbed of a childhood, had a ridiculously sucky teenhood, survived a bullet to the eye... and then DIES?! From a walker bite?! He doesn't even at least get the opportunity to become an adult after everything they've put him through? THAT'S the story they're giving Rick freaking Grimes' son? They're just cutting off Rick's true legacy like that?

Carl Grimes deserves better than this. His death is completely unnecessary. I understand that this is The Walking Dead and that people are going to die. I'm okay with that. What I'm NOT okay with is a needless death, especially for a character as important as Carl. I am heartbroken, empty... I can't even explain to you guys. Nothing else matters to me right now honestly, so this is my reaction video for 8x08. Just the Carl moments. No funny edits. 

This ""writing decision"" is so beyond messed up. Chandler confirmed that killing Carl was Gimple's vision, not his own. It had nothing to do with Chandler wanting to go to college or whatever other excuse. I can't get behind this. I really think I've drawn the line here. When Negan arrived, the tone of the show changed and I wasn't *as* into it anymore... but I kept hope alive and stayed invested all because of this character and Grimes Family 2.0 -- But they have torn everything apart with this move. Not to be dramatic........ but, like.... I can't go on. 

I will tune in to 8x09 to see his actual death scene/send off, but after that... I don't know. I still care about Rick and Michonne, but part of the beauty of their relationship was rooted in their love for Carl and that amazing family unit. That's gone now... sooo... What's left? What is Rick fighting for now? Yeah, Judith is a thing.. but she's not his biological child. Neither is Gracie. And yeah, there's Maggie and Glenn's baby... but at this rate they'll probably have her miscarry for the ~emotional value~ and ~character development~ for gods sake. Are Rick and Michonne gonna add to the baby train and pop out another one?! Another baby we're never gonna get to know the way we knew Carl? It's stupid. It's just not the same. Taking care of multiple babies in the apocalypse and raising them successfully is less realistic than Carl Grimes prematurely dying from a walker bite. Thanks.

God of War (commonly referred to as God of War 4 or God of War PS4 is a third-person action-adventure video game in development by Santa Monica Studio and to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. God of War 4 is available for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) console. It will be the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. The story is a new direction for the series, as it will be loosely based on Norse mythology all previous games were based on Greek mythology. Series protagonist Kratos returns as the main character, and he now has a son named Atreus. Kratos acts as a mentor and protector to his son, and has to master the rage that has driven him for many years.

Weapons in God of War 2018 include: Leviathan Axe, Runic Attack Gems, Grip, Talon Bow, Runic Summon and more! Armor in God of War 4 include: Chest Armor, Wrist Armor, Waist Armor and Talismans. The type of Skills you can gain are broken into skill trees such as Leviathan Axe, Ranged Combat, Close Combat, Guardian Shield, Shield Combat, Rage Combat, Talon Bow, Magic Combat and Expert Combat. Throughout the God of War story there are many things to collect like Artifacts, Treasure Maps, Shrines, Hidden Chambers, Special Items and Idunn Apples. 

Many years have passed since Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods. Having survived his final encounter with Zeus, Kratos now lives with his young son Atreus in the world of the Norse gods, a savage land inhabited by many ferocious monsters and warriors. In order to teach his son how to survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years and embrace his newfound role as a single father and mentor. Kratos must also contend with the Norse gods themselves as they are taking precautions against him, due to them being aware of his role in the destruction of Olympus. Over the course of their time together, Atreus learns more about his father's complicated and shady past, while struggling with whether to be like his father or choose to be his own person.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oUMRwOAa-BY/sddefault.jpg,0.02580170806969868,0.0004158805268786712,62.041154615604455,0.0028939294279628127,0.026217588596577347,0.02911151802454016,2018-04-19,12:00:07,Thursday,3,13,91,13,20,61,440,3,61,4,2,5,52,2,17,4.0,4.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.618180042674607,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

The designer, 47, said Harry spoke to her after the ceremony at St George's Chapel. 'He came straight up to me and he said ""oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning"". 'So I think for the both of them, they were just radiant at that time,' she said. Ms Waight Keller's comments come as Kensington Palace tweeted sketches (top and bottom right) of Meghan's dress. It said: 'The Duchess and Ms. Waight Keller worked closely together on the design, epitomising a timeless minimal elegance referencing the codes of the iconic House of Givenchy.'

‚ñ† SUPPORT MY HARD WORK:

I spent many hours to design a paper airplane and make a tutorial. The design process can take up to 6 months or even more. Many adjustments were made to assure the paper airplane is foldable and fliable before a plane is considered for a tutorial. Then, it takes days to record the test flights, instructions and videos editing before the video is published on YouTube.

The Canon - Do you think that the success of Black Panther can not only be a win for the genre, but a win specifically for Aquaman? Exploring another King torn between trying to serve two worlds? Or could it possibly be hurt because it is too similar?

Diego Martinez - Hey John, love the show and watch almost every day. Just wondering if you‚Äôve seen the post from Stallone with the first poster for Creed 2 with Drago and his son on it? I like it, but it does look a bit cheap for a poster. It comes from Stallone so it is ‚Äúreal‚Äù, but do you think it‚Äôs ‚Äúofficial‚Äù? Know what I mean? Thanks and keep up the great work!

Abdullah S - Hey John, what do you think of the news that is cycling in social media that George Lucas will return to Direct an Obi wan Kenobi movie with Ewan McGregor Since Lucas made it clear before that he was done with Star wars?

This is how a Bugatti is made.¬†Like other works of art,¬†this supercar is a limited edition.¬†Only 450 of them will ever be made.¬†Bugatti calls its 1,000-square-meter production¬†facility the Atelier.¬†Instead of a typical assembly line found¬†in most car factories, the Veyron is assembled¬†at individual stations.

Here, a technician unites the transmission with¬†the engine and carefully bolts them together with¬†a handheld ratchet.¬†The mechanical components of¬†the car‚Äôs rear section have all been assembled. ¬†Technicians push the back end along a track¬†to meet the front.¬†The track sits below the floor and is covered by¬†metal plates that open and close around the trolly feet¬†as they move.¬†The workers join the two sections with just 14¬†titanium bolts. Once again, they use handheld ratchets rather¬†than power tools.¬†

The powerful mechanics of the Veyron have been¬†assembled, but a Bugatti is not a Bugatti without its¬†sculpted exterior.¬†To bring the Veyron to its artful conclusion,¬†technicians wear white gloves so as not to mar¬†the surface with fingerprints.¬†They install each component with the¬†same care and precision used throughout.¬†But before reaching this stage, an expert tests the¬†car‚Äôs systems at this rolling-test station.¬†These components are part of the¬†rear-wing assembly.¬†At high speeds, the rear wing extends¬†and provides massive downward force to keep¬†the car firmly on the ground. And when the driver breaks, it immediately flips to a¬†vertical position, adding the braking power of a¬†hatchback to the car‚Äôs powerful ceramic disks.

Here, a specialist prepares the car¬†for its final inspection.¬†The car will spend two entire days at¬†this station as he painstakingly buffs¬†and polishes the car to shining perfection.¬†He must ensure that every centimeter of the surface¬†is absolutely flawless.

Bugatti‚Äôs¬†Molsheim factory¬†built the Veyron from 2005-2015.¬†The factory now only builds the new Chiron.¬†

Ressence, the Swiss-Belgian watch brand, unveiled its Ressence Type 2 E-Crown Concept. The 45mm titanium watch combines Ressence‚Äôs ‚ÄúRessence Orbital Convex System‚Äù planetary time display with an electronic timing module that can correct timing error in the mechanical caliber. It can be controlled and programmed using the Ressence E-Crown App, and the system can be programmed to store two independent time zones. Setting and corrections can be performed with the E-Crown App, by tap-activating the module, and by conventional mechanical means with the caseback lever. The E-Crown can recharge itself by auto-open solar panel covers and by a mechanical winding system. The E-Crown module also can store the time if the mechanical component of the watch stops, and it can reset the correct time as soon as the mechanical movement resumes.

Greubel Forsey wowed showgoers with its Greubel Forsey Earth GMT. The Earth GMT combines three time zones, a world time function, a 24-second inclined tourbillon, a 360-degree globe that acts as a time zone, a three-day power reserve, and a convenient GMT-pusher to enable quick jumping of the primary reference time zone. Extensive sapphire crystals enable easy viewing of the expansive caliber. 33 pieces will be offered exclusively in white gold, and the timepiece measures an impressive 45.5mm.

How do you make it a functional small space on a budget? In this episode of The Home Primp, Chatelaine Home Editor Alexandra Gater takes a trip to Ikea for some small space furniture ideas and leaves with everything she needs without dropping a ton of cash. Watch as she hacks the $10 Ikea Frack mirror into a wall light, jazzes up the Skogsta stool with chalk paint and makes an entryway organizer out of an Bekvam spice rack.
 
The trick to creating a living space when your apartment is too small for a couch? Don‚Äôt forego the Queen-sized bed ‚Äî instead, turn your bed into a couch with a few cushions and tons of cozy throws. And one Ikea Kallax shelf is the perfect way to divide this space and even creates a little space for an entryway.
 
We hope you love these small space ideas as much as we do! Questions or ideas for the Home Primp series? Comment down below or send Alexandra a message on Instagram @alexandragater.

Working for the Kardashians is like living on another planet. There are so many rules that Kardashian staff members have to follow, that are given to them by Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and the whole fam. From folding sweaters in a certain way to not wearing jewelry, it‚Äôs a fascinating world.
 
Whether you‚Äôre a DASH Doll like Stephanie De Souza or a bodyguard like Pascal Duvier, you need to follow all the Kardashian rules. Wondering what those are? Kim‚Äôs former assistant Stephanie Shepherd has dished a lot of insider info about working for Kim and Kanye West. And you won‚Äôt believe what Kylie Jenner gets her housekeeper to do for her Kylie Cosmetics company. It wouldn‚Äôt be in any other housekeeper‚Äôs job description.
 
Watch our TheTalko video to discover 20 strict rules all Kardashian staff members must follow, and tell us in comments which one you think is the most ridiculous of all.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

From ideal sample preservation, to the preparation of useful cryogels, freeze dryers are used all throughout science.

As machines go, they're actually really simple with only a few parts, so in this video I demonstrate how to make a freeze dryer in an afternoon.

Parts list:

1 gallon vacuum chamber - https://www.ebay.com/itm/SVac-1-Gallon-Tall-Stainless-Steel-Vacuum-Chamber-and-BVV130-3CFM-Mini-Pump-Kit/302605256298?hash=item4674adc66a:g:xLAAAOSw7p5aXn~Z

1/4"" flare union - hardware store
5/8"" barb splicer - hardware store
foam sheets (I used styrofoam) - hardware store
Glue (spray adhesive is ideal but most will work) - hardware store
Dry ice - grocery store
Denatured Ethanol - hardware store
Svg2 field piece vacuum gauge - https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fieldpiece-SVG3-Digital-Micron-Vacuum-Gauge-Replaces-SVG2-Easy-View/121751043579?epid=19003302604&hash=item1c58ed7dfb:g:sbUAAOxyf~hRyedr
2 stage rotary vane vacuum pump - cheap models likely won't work. Invest in a decent pump
