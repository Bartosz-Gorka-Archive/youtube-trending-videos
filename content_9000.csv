It’s hard to believe we’re now five years removed from Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm, which subsequently spawned a new trilogy of Star Wars movies that began with The Force Awakens as well as the creation of anthology-like spinoff films, which began with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. But as Episode IX’s 2019 release looms closer, Lucasfilm and Disney are starting to look to how this franchise will continue once the story of Rey, Finn, etc. is complete.

The first major step was announced last month with the news that Star Wars: The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson will develop a brand new trilogy of Star Wars movies featuring new characters and new settings, offering our first entirely-new Star Wars films since George Lucas’s 1977 original. Details on this new trilogy are scarce beyond the fact that Johnson will at least write and direct the first installment, so when Collider’s own Steve Weintraub spoke with Johnson at the press day for The Last Jedi, he had some questions.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Nick Rosenbloo - My family and I have watched for many years, girls had an awesome chance to meet you in ATL. Anyways, a few years back there was an awesome animated storyboard for ""Stretch Armstrong"" that you, Amie Rose, Dennis, and i believe Schnepp reviewed on AMC, you all gave it hi praise and I also enjoyed it.  Any word on an update, if i recall it was also slated to be a R high action.

PATREON Supporter Dion Sheppard - Hey John, I just read that Fabian Wagner, cinematographer for Justice Leauge, just came out and confirmed he did shoot scenes with the black suit for Superman. He also stated the scene with Alfred stating "" Let's hope you're not too late"" was one of his favourite to shoot. Why were such pivotal scenes cut from this film?!

Greta Vankamp - Ok what’s going on. I just heard that Ryan Reynolds is going to star in the Detective Pikachu movie. How does one go from Deadpool and an R rated Hitman’s Bodyguard to a kids movie? Is he going to fight pokemon and behead them? Don’t get me wrong, I love Reynolds, but this seems weird to me. What do you think?

Bruce Gordon -  In a Interview for TVNZ Kathleen Kennedy said she would love too see Taika Waititi direct a Star Wars film. Chances are this ain’t going to happen but it kinda gets me excited at the possibility. So John what do you think?

Jeremy Garcia - How would you respond to someone making the argument that the DCEU is actually more healthy than the MCU due to the fact that the first bunch of DCEU movies have made more at the box office than the same first number of MCU movies?

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

Can You Be Too Clean? 
http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151118-can-you-be-too-clean 
“Some scientists also tell us that being too clean is also wrong, because it might help cause asthma and allergies. So is there a balance between keeping obsessively clean and learning to live with the bacteria all around us?” 

Getting the dirt on immunity: Scientists show evidence for hygiene hypothesis
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120322142157.htm 
“Medical professionals have suggested that the hygiene hypothesis explains the global increase of allergic and autoimmune diseases in urban settings. However, neither biologic support nor a mechanistic basis for the hypothesis has been directly demonstrated. Until now.” 

The ‘hygiene hypothesis’ for autoimmune and allergic diseases: an update
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841828/ 
“According to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’, the decreasing incidence of infections in western countries and more recently in developing countries is at the origin of the increasing incidence of both autoimmune and allergic diseases. The hygiene hypothesis is based upon epidemiological data, particularly migration studies, showing that subjects migrating from a low-incidence to a high-incidence country acquire the immune disorders with a high incidence at the first generation.”

The magical final chapter of the Twelfth Doctor's (Peter Capaldi) journey sees the Time Lord team up with his former self, the first ever Doctor (David Bradley - Harry Potter, Game of Thrones) and a returning Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie), for one last adventure. 

Two Doctors stranded in an Arctic snowscape, refusing to face regeneration. Enchanted glass people, stealing their victims from frozen time. And a World War One captain destined to die on the battlefield, but taken from the trenches to play his part in the Doctor's story.

An uplifting new tale about the power of hope in humanity's darkest hours, Twice Upon A Time marks the end of an era. But as the Doctor must face his past to decide his future, his journey is only just beginning.

'Twice Upon A Time' premieres Christmas night at 9/8c on BBC America.

The Doctor (Peter Capaldi) is an alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through all of time and space in his TARDIS with his companion. Instead of dying, the Doctor is able to ""regenerate"" into a new body, taking on a new personality with each regeneration.

If you see Jennifer Lawrence out in public, don’t expect her to be too friendly.

Not a lot of people would admit they’re rude in public, but Jennifer Lawrence isn’t like most people.

J. Law recently sat down to chat with comedian Adam Sandler for Variety’s Actors on Actors series and the celebs got to talking about how fans feel like they know them because of their public personas. Adam revealed that he’s had people literally pull up a chair at his dinner table at a restaurant in the past and was surprised when Jennifer didn’t have any similar experiences. Here’s how the actress explained her reason for this.

But even though Jen think she’s gives off a vibe that deters people from bothering her too much when she’s out and about, she realizes how hard it must be for people like her best friend Amy Schumer, who’s basically know for being friendly and relatable.

Jennifer has been open in the past about how there’s a fine line between wanting to show fans appreciation for supporting her work and allowing herself no privacy. She told The Daily Telegraph last December QUOTE “I think that people think that we already are friends because I am famous and they feel like they already know me - but I don't know them. I have to protect my bubble, like, 'I have a weird job — don't let this be a reality.'""

We also have to remember that Jennifer is a human who has insecurities like the rest of us, and there are some days when she simply doesn’t want to be photographed. She explained to Vogue magazine QUOTE “I’m happy to meet people, give autographs, shake hands, and say thank you; I wouldn’t have a job if people weren’t going to see my movies. It’s just…if I’m on an airplane and I have no makeup on, I don’t want to take a selfie that’s going to end up on E!”

Only Jennifer Lawrence could literally admit to being rude to fans and we still find a way to love her. Do you think Jen has a valid point for her self-proclaimed rudeness, or should she welcome all fan interactions? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below. I’m your host Renee Ariel, thanks so much for watching.

And then click to the left to find out why Jennifer may be quitting acting soon. Thanks again to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring today’s episode. Xfinity Mobile is a new kind of network designed to save you money.

And what are the results? Was it effective? Will I continue living this way? Is this even possible?
I actually think it's easier than you think. 

Here are the essentials to succeeding in this lifestyle:
1. Reusable coffee cup
2. Reusable water bottle
3. Cotton bag for groceries
4. Bamboo toothbrush
5. Menstrual cup for ladies
6. Stainless steel razor blade
7. Bees Wax Wraps
8. Stainless Steel cutlery set

Small steps you can take to make a massive difference:
1. Say no to plastic straws
2. If you need to use a disposable coffee cup, say no to the lid
3. Say no to plastic bags
4. Learn to make your own toiletries which are cheaper and better for you anyway. 

Just remember, any small way you can start cutting out this major pollutant right now is better than not doing anything at all!

So take baby steps wherever you can. The future generations deserve it :)

Five years later they were household names with their hit single ""MMMBop."" The three brothers have been recording songs and touring the world ever since, and they've also started their own record label and beer company. We chatted with Hanson about their current tour, how they got into the beer business, and what's next for the trio. Following is a transcript of the video.

Zac: Hi. I'm Zac. That's Taylor. This is Isaac. We all have the same last name. It's Hanson.

We are a band called Hanson.

Taylor: We've been playing music for 25 years, and somehow we have not killed each other yet.

Zac: Yes.Which is really the only achievement we've achieved. As far as achievements go.

So, one of our most famous songs is called ""MMMBop.""

Talking about how we got started is a little different than, I think, most bands, because ...

Taylor: We were so young.

Zac: We're brothers. And two:  we were incredibly young. I was 6.

At that time, we were just singing. I mean, we were just a vocal group. We had ... we all played piano at some level.

We played a ton of schools. And we were able to sort of be this reflection of potential for kids. That was really the first place we saw screaming girls.

Isaac: Yeah, exactly.

Zac: I think that's why maybe we weren't quite as shocked by it when, you know ...

Taylor: when it happened in a big way.

Zac: ... international stardom came.

They say that you're most likely to meet your significant other at work. And we are a part of that statistic. We all met our wives playing concerts.

Our inspiration was '50s music. Was rock 'n roll. Was looking at young artists who had started in their teens. The Jackson 5 and Chuck Berry ...

Taylor: The Beach Boys.

All: Buddy Holly.

Taylor: The heart of this band is to be creating things. And to be inventing things. And to be excited about the future.

We started a record company, you know, on our third album, before I was twenty years old.

We have put out six major studio albums. We have a global fan base that we still tour with all the time, year after year.

We chose to start a record company, because we could see that there wasn't a future at a major label that was focused on quarterly earnings and sort of stacking stacking artists like assets that they could just trade.

And really the decision in starting a record company was about whether we were invested in our own future, or whether we were going to really just become a commodity.

We set up a distribution deal, built a new team with a new management company, and did a lot of stuff that nobody had any idea how to do.

Five years ago, we started a beer company. Four years ago we started a craft beer and music festival. And really had a passion for craft beer and the culture around craft beer as well.

Isaac: Which I think is one of the more important things really, about the kind of craft beer experience. At least for us in a lot of ways. Besides obviously making quality beer. But the community itself actually felt very similar to the music community.

Taylor: Mmmhops is a title of a beer, not the whole company, but the title of our first beer. And it is definitely one of those, you know, names that's so ridiculous that it just had to be. It had to exist. And it's been fun to share that with people.

The Christmas album has been a long time coming. And ever since the first one, which was received so well ...

Isaac: Back in 1997.

Taylor: Yeah, twenty years ago.

There was a trickle of, ""Are you guys gonna make a follow-up?""

People expect to be reflective. To be reminiscent. To go back and be nostalgic. And so they expect to open up the box of things that they loved, and come back to it.

Zac: Certain anniversaries just can't be ignored. And when we reached 25 years this year, it seemed like it was important to kind of stop and look back a little bit more than we normally would.

We decided to do a tour, really talking about the history of the band. You look at it the audience, and you see your peers, and you see their kids, and you see their parents.

Taylor: You know, the future of music is not just this one-way street. Where we send things out, and then people applaud. It's you share music, and you get a response. And then you hear the response. And you hear the interaction between fans. And then you keep trying to create opportunities for that to grow. And, for us, there actually are potentially twenty-five more years or more in our future, if we choose it. And it feels like we're at a place where we can make that choice.

The Western Electric Model 500 and its subsequent variants were so ubiquitous that you almost couldn't go anywhere without seeing one, especially in the United States where it was standard equipment from the phone company.
Even if you're not American, if you've seen any of our movies, you'll have seen this phone, too.  A literal fixture of American life, this phone was inescapable.  But its ubiquity also caused some filmmakers or TV show producers to get a little lazy.  This video tells that story.

Here's a link to the video of the Model 500 from 1958.  Yes I said 1957 in the video.  I am truly sorry.  My oversight is abhorrent.  I am ashamed.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxiHaqKxxiE/sddefault.jpg,0.014032867026036098,0.0002439617517856753,57.52076677316294,0.0014224606933190337,0.014276828777821772,0.0156992894711408,2018-04-10,18:49:56,Tuesday,1,8,42,8,37,41,348,1,79,0,1,5,19,3,2,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.464951282907162,5,"['happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,5,0,0,0,{'person': 6},6

via BET:
""Just the night before, I had attended a pre-Oscar cocktail party for women in film. There I had met a young actor named Ryan Destiny,"" she wrote. ""She had appeared in the Lee Daniels series Star. I had heard that she looked like me. I saw her in person and she looks like I literally gave birth to her. Gab 2.0, only better.""

She then recalled the brief exchange they had, which led to her having a not-so-polite thought about the young star, who was having a fan-girl moment after meeting the iconic actress.

""'Oh my God,' she said. 'I am finally meeting you. This is so amazing.' 'What are you, twelve?' 'Twenty-two.' 'S**t.' 'I admire you so much,' she said. 'If you could mentor me...' B***h, f**k you, I thought. You want me to mentor you?"" she recalled. ""The press is literally calling you the next Gabrielle Union... 'except she can sing and dance!' I smiled, and the photographers came over. They needed to document this moment of 'Look who's old!'""

Destiny has, apparently, gotten word of what Union wrote about her and spoke about the exchange with Live Civil. The Star actress claimed she was completely clueless about what Union was thinking in her head as it didn't show on the outside, whatsoever.

""That was very weird to me, weird in a good way because I didn't expect her to put me in her book, period,"" she said. ""I remember the time that we did meet, which is the situation she was addressing in her book, and she was very nice. I wouldn't have known that she was thinking any of the stuff that she said she was thinking in her head at all. It's interesting because she was just talking to me and we were just chopping it up about what I was filming at the time... and she was just being supportive of that and she told me to push through it.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AydU3Gnj_VY/sddefault.jpg,0.010188463471124024,0.0009674419679213572,10.531343283582087,0.002705949623708393,0.011155905439045379,0.013861855062753774,2017-12-08,19:55:21,Friday,4,16,27,16,20,84,201,5,23,1,0,14,0,5,2,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.436541854408406,2,"['neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

LYRICS:
[Verse 1 – Julie Bergan]:
Fireflies
A million little pieces
Feeds the dying light
And breathes me back to life
 
In your eyes 
I see something to believe in
Your hands are like a flame
It brings the sweetest pain (your palms, the sweetest pain)

[Chorus – Julie Bergan]:
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite [x3]

[Verse 2 – Julie Bergan]:
So alive
Your touch is like the daylight
Burning on my skin
It turns me on again
 
You and I
Survivors of the same kind
And we’re the only ones
Dancing on the sun

[Chorus – Julie Bergan]:
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
You’re the demon in my mind             
Like a fever, feels so right
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite [x3]

[Bridge - Seungri]:
Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight
We’re monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life
Just like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars
Hear you calling for me
Hear you calling me on from afar

[Chorus – Julie Bergan]:
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
I feel the heat as we collide
Like a fever that feels so right
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite [x6]",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Az-mGR-CehY/sddefault.jpg,0.008545686296884646,0.00019061083460762432,44.83316131780279,0.00026113943522766334,0.008736297131492269,0.008997436566719929,2018-05-12,07:29:58,Saturday,5,11,24,10,22,59,180,7,40,1,0,7,0,0,3,4.0,7.0,['OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO'],"['OFFICIAL', 'MUSIC', 'VIDEO']",True,"['offici', 'music', 'video']",3,3,16,0,0,0,0,5.858124330100304,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:

The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-cpTrx_Lm8/sddefault.jpg,0.017234037223516446,0.0006011873450063876,28.66666666666667,0.0017999835389179344,0.01783522456852283,0.01963520810744077,2017-11-23,09:35:01,Thursday,3,6,38,6,33,47,334,0,79,0,1,5,14,1,0,7.0,8.0,"['De', '= JAMES', 'Pas']","['De', '=', 'JAMES', 'Pas']",True,"['De', '=', 'jame', 'pa']",4,4,9,1,0,1,0,6.150326373929883,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat.  But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.

Following the scent, he and his partner Boudicca Rising unearthed a shocking history of animals deaths which would lead to a nationwide hunt for what it thought to be the UK’s first serial animal killer.

Now with over 350 victims, the killer has been given many names: the Croydon Cat Killer, the M25 Animal Killer, the UK Animal Killer. The brutal “signature” display of the dismembered pets around the homes of their owners is a chilling indication of the killer’s intention to do harm to people as much as the animals.

In an unlikely union between two renegade animal rights activists and the establishment, Tony and Boudicca are joined in following the trail of bodies by the RSPCA and the MET police. Together they balance the emotional demands of the case with the need for a clear minded approach to a bewildering and unrelenting string of attacks.

With unprecedented access to the action as it unravels, “Catching a Cat Killer” goes to the heart of of a strange and chilling quest to end the killing spree

Recently Treyarch added the (kinda) new game mode “Infected” into Black Ops 3!

It’s actually a pretty good addition to BO3!

I just wish it would allow for 18 players and be a permanent addition to the game…

…maybe we’ll get stuff this cool in Black Ops 4, who knows!

Also, Gravity Spikes, Brecci and Dabs for BO4. Vondy pls

So, what do you think about Infected in Black Ops 3? Let me know with a comment! ^-^

Prior to the vote, Senate Republicans snuck in a provision that lured one reluctant Republican: Bob Corker. He voted for the bill, and signaled support for it immediately after this provision was included. Even without this particular provision, Republican lawmakers—most of which are multi-millionaires—would still personally benefit from the passage of this legislation. They literally voted for a tax reform plan that will make themselves even more rich. This is theft.

Lyrics:

Shedontknowbutsheknows

Hanging by the bar at sunrise
With our bodies talking
Hooked up last week, had a good time
So I regret nothing

I see her come close, ooh
I wonder what you told her to make her stay

She don't know what you did when you come back home
She don't know what you doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, ooh)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
She don't know what you're doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, ooh)

Blaming me for all the sadness
Didn't know 'bout you two
Don't see why I'm dragged into it
This whole thing is on you

I see her heart break, ooh
Still she's keeping face
Leave it to me, 'cause, babe

She don't know what you did when you come back home
She don't know what you doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, ooh)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
She don't know what you're doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, ooh)

Don't even bother with your lies
Won't let you see her when she cries
Go on, unhappy in the night

She don't know what you did when you come back home
She don't know what you doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, ooh)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
She don't know what you're doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, ooh).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3Q-YxDmXmc/sddefault.jpg,0.008512348209047584,0.00017198286600605958,49.49532710280374,0.00013662190290200996,0.008684331075053644,0.008820952977955654,2017-11-19,05:04:04,Sunday,6,5,1,5,1,40,2,3,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,7.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.617907400209159,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

LYRICS

Voices in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They’re pulling me under.

I’ve swallowed myself but the fever remains
I’m numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain
If I showed you my soul, would you cover your eyes?
If I told you the truth, would you dare me to lie?

I keep it all inside because I know that man is every thing but kind

Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices

As I walk through this valley of shadows and death
I curse not the “wicked”, I praise not the “blessed”
If I told you the truth, you’d beg me to change
If fear were a currency, you’d own the bank

I don’t want to live so calloused and frozen / ugly and hopeless
I don’t want to live forever, I just want to live right now
You can’t take me from me

I keep it all inside because I know that man is everything but kind",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3faYe5V4Sk/sddefault.jpg,0.009868117855703993,0.0002877636900824287,34.2924357582338,0.0003911142155228184,0.010155881545786418,0.010546995761309236,2018-05-23,16:31:10,Wednesday,2,7,22,7,21,45,195,3,40,2,0,4,0,1,2,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.636346050898222,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

On 19 November 1997, one of the most dramatic rescues in RNLI history took place. Battling rough seas and gale-force winds, the lifeboat crew worked with the Coastguard to save 15 sailors from the sinking cargo vessel. 

It was a rescue of triumph and tragedy. Coxswain Hewitt Clark received a Gold Medal and his crew Bronze Medals, for their role. Tragically, Coastguard winchman Bill Deacon, who was swept from the deck by a huge wave after rescuing ten people, died in the rescue. The RNLI has recognised his courage with a posthumous Thanks on Vellum, with a joint Vellum also going to the remainder of the aircraft’s crew.

Footage from the Coastguard, STV and Lerwick Lifeboat Station.

The RNLI is the charity that saves lives at sea. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, lifeboat crews around the UK and Ireland are ready to launch to help those in need. Whether you’re stuck on a sinking ship, cut off by a rapidly rising tide, or in the water and close to drowning, RNLI crew members will drop everything to come to your rescue. 95% of RNLI lifeboat crews and station staff are volunteers. 

But it’s not just lifeboats. RNLI lifeguards patrol 248 beaches across the UK and Channel Islands, keeping people safe, providing safety advice and rescuing those in trouble. Education volunteers visit schools and swimming clubs to help teach the next generation how to enjoy the water safely. And volunteer fundraisers and shop workers give up their time to generate vital funds. The RNLI is also working to help communities around the world that are most at risk of drowning.

If you spot someone in trouble in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the coastguard.

When we finally found our door and went inside to the airbnb, it was very nice and safe. BUT the experience leading up to it was so SCARY!! Anyway, tomorrow we will explore more of PRAGUE!!

Bullet Ants of Asia vs. Termite Kings and Queens: I never imagined the action to be this intense! Watch our Diacamma sp. ant colony in their terrarium called the Shire as they hunt down dealate termites in the midst of a nuptial flight. The meeting of these two arch enemies kept me on the edge of my seat as it all unfolded! You won't believe the ending!

Lyrics
After all this time
You still couldn’t recognise
That your problem lies within
In a vicious circle
Can you tell me why
Why you’ve thrown it all away
Cos it makes no sense to me
Why you wouldn’t listen

Watching you decline
What were you expecting
I can’t save you from yourself
When you don’t want saving
It’s on your head
Don’t point the finger point the blame
Cos the warning signs were clear
You just wouldn’t listen

I know it hurts
Tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won’t mean anything
I hope it hurts
You’ve only got yourself to blame
And I can’t take this anymore
I’m over it
So over it

Breathe in breathe out
I feel it coming round again
Breathe in breathe out
Don’t wanna ride your carousel
Breathe in breathe out
Don’t know how much more I can take
Breathe in breathe out
Just stop cos I'm about to break

hello, my dear friend.
I know I say this almost each time I write to you, where I talk about how quickly our year is passing by... 
but with this week over, we will be through a third of our year! Every day is just flying by, especially with pressing deadlines and big exams/projects we are dreading to execute. I have been in a tough place the past few days of this week, as I was kind of feeling overwhelmed and not having enough time to get everything done. In addition, I am sick, again! What else is new though... It's just headaches and a sore throat for now, like the head ache I had through this painting video..
But I still put my efforts out to find the things that keep me centered in my walk through life! God, family, blessings like you.. 
It was my sister's birthday a couple days ago on monday (she thanks you for all the birthday wishes!) and I had so much to do that day AND night, I was afraid I wouldn't allocate enough time for her at dinner. A part of me wanted to ask if we could just have a quick dinner so I could start homework asap and sleep, but a part of me still cared so much and wanted to do something more.

My studio class got out 20 minutes early (yay!) and I walked to the downtown market to get some snacks, and made her pasta for dinner. It was nice, we ended up talking until like 9pm. That's when I finally started homework, but despite having procrastinated, my mood was so much improved. 
It reminded me that this is why I live! And what I am so thankful for! Family and love. What a blessing that she is here at school with me for another year or so. School assignments will keep coming as long as I am trying to learn and grow with these challenges, but I keep telling myself that I am at times caught up in the moment of it all, but decades from now, college will have just been a memory.. And I know I will just wish that I made the best of it all to live as happily as possible.

There is so much more I would want to say regarding that, but I will perhaps talk about it in a video. I still wonder how much growth I am to experience in the latter half of my college career! Thank you for being on this journey alongside me, as I share my thoughts and content with you. Thank you for reading this, and for your thoughtful and tender words that I read in the comments.

See you soon, much love.
Annabelle

Hey Guys,

I'm so sorry this workout video took a little longer than planned but it is finally here! In this video I will share my 20 min full body workout that I used to get ready for the Victoria's Secret Show.

These exercises are really amazing for toning the body and lengthening all the muscles, especially if I need to be ready for a show or bikini shoot!

The best part is you can do this anywhere, at home, the gym or on holiday. For equipment I used hand weights, ankle weights and a resistance band. If you don’t have these at home you can also do this without! Also if you wanna make the workout a little harder use heavier weights or do more reps! 

I would love to hear from you guys what you guys think of my first workout video and also please comment below what else you would like to see! 


Enjoy!!

I'm so excited to explore somewhere Alex and I have never been before so make sure you had over to my Instagram to follow the adventure :) As always for transparency these items were purchased with a combination of my own money (everything from Net-a-porter) and vouchers from the brands themselves.

i never had the courage to tell you i adore you
i did it in a song i was too afraid to call you
im sorry i know im annoying
i just want your attention
ever since i saw you knew nothing was important
your gravity is too strong its fucking up my orbit
contact avoided by the time i record this
i just want you to listen
everytime i see you, you brighten up my day
you’re cashmere to my cotton and i wished you felt the same
more options in the alphabet i know ill be OK
no i wont
its them rose tinted cheeks
they black flag we AF
we BF as AF
but they wont get that
thats that 20 century women reference
you so hard to get like intricate metaphors
companies? i own four
but all i want is yours
hit the plex and catch a band or sushi spot i recommend
float around hitting wheelies leg or engine based it all depends
either one is cool to me
and you’re way too cool for me
ima freeze to death tryna keep up
thirsty i am i may need three cups
eye contact
speeding down the 5 in my newest ride
you was kinda high speakers mild high
track 10 track 10, dirtbike afternoons
as long as pale skin is near i didnt have to leave the room
switch gears
roamed around around fell in love
broke my leg and got stuck what the fuck
hit my head, wait, i wish you would fall in too i said
i wish you would fall in and snap them legs
cause ima be stuck here until im dead and gone
i remember when we first met
my eyes, like jeans too tight, i couldnt take em off you
you’re precious metal i was a magnet just looking
ive been searching for something
but didnt know what i was looking for
then you popped and it became so clear
like that water up north, so clear
im intimidated by your existence
flustered because of your presence
your absence leaves me in a state of confusion
i cant function, i cant explain it
im aware enough to know this is just a temporary pool of emotion
but since im here, i might as well drown
please dont save me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BAT477KNGfY/sddefault.jpg,0.03976491853130187,0.0003696796573547985,107.56588235294113,0.002460761766251118,0.04013459818865666,0.04259535995490778,2018-04-18,19:27:58,Wednesday,2,6,21,6,20,37,145,2,25,3,0,0,0,0,1,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.6665583274587497,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'vase': 1},1

In the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris—an attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe. The film follows the course of the friends’ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack. Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.

The heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film. Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (“Hall Pass,” TV’s “The Office”); Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes”); Ray Corasani (TV’s upcoming “The Long Road Home”); PJ Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”); Tony Hale (TV’s “Veep”); and Thomas Lennon (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”). Paul-Mikél Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer‬.

Eastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern. Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier. The film’s executive producer is Bruce Berman.

Behind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood’s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood’s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut “Sully,” and that film’s composer, Christian Jacob. Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in “Sully” and in “Dunkirk,” serves as production designer.

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, “The 15:17 to Paris.”  

The film will be released in theaters beginning February 9, 2018. It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

Hey guys today is a full video that has been HIGHLY requested for the longest time - this is an IN DEPTH video ALL about how to apply false eyelashes and why you might be struggling doing it. There are quite a few things to consider before you just apply them, and I think there are a lot of steps neglected before people just start glueing stuff on your eyes - these steps will hopefully help. Let me know if you have any further questions!

But after an hour-long televised meeting, it was still unclear what specific legislation Trump would support. And the wide-ranging meeting, which included blunt back-and-forths between Trump and members of both parties, laid bare the vast divide on gun legislation and Trump's own unfamiliarity with the searing, years-old gun debate.
Trump again, brought up his support for raising the age of gun purchases from 18 to 21, though he didn't specifically say he would sign a bill that includes that provision.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BC1cMJQrG4s/sddefault.jpg,0.006960383534109275,0.003069359373090139,2.2676991150442483,0.0125762246879711,0.010029742907199414,0.022605967595170508,2018-02-28,23:08:42,Wednesday,2,10,15,10,15,54,129,4,25,2,1,2,3,3,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.644668324309384,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"{'tie': 2, 'person': 2}",4

The country’s top media regulator — the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China (SAPPRFT) — now “specifically requires that programs should not feature actors with tattoos [or depict] hip hop culture, sub-culture (non-mainstream culture) and dispirited culture (decadent culture),” Sina, a Chinese news outlet, reports.

Gao Changli, director of the administration’s publicity department, outlined four “Don’t” rules on Friday:

- Absolutely do not use actors whose heart and morality are not aligned with the party and whose morality is not noble
- Absolutely do not use actors who are tasteless, vulgar and obscene
- Absolutely do not use actors whose ideological level is low and have no class
- Absolutely do not use actors with stains, scandals and problematic moral integrity

The ban follows the removal of the prominent rapper GAI from Hunan TV’s Singer, a hit competition show. Clips of GAI, whose real name is Zhou Yan, were also removed from China Hunan TV’s official Youtube Channel, but no official explanation has been given. He does however appear in the show’s trailer

Ferriss is the bestselling author of ""The 4-Hour Workweek,"" a podcast host, an entrepreneur, and an investor.

Here are the routine steps:
1. Get out of bed within 2 mins of alarm going off
2. Make your bed immediately
3. Sit down and meditate for 10-20 mins
4. Take a cold shower
5. Drink some green tea
6. Write in a monkey mind journal (listing all the things that are on your mind. It doesn't need to make sense, just clear your mind.
7. Write in a different diary 3 things you're grateful for, what would make today great, 3 points daily affirmations and at night recap and write 3 awesome things that happen today
8. Bullet journal, everything to accomplish for the day and have top three priorities to focus on.

This all takes around 45 minutes.

Then you can proceed with 20-90 minutes of exercise or do it at your desired time that day.

I have yet to come across a more complex morning routine but I needed to find the best routine for me that would get the most out of my day. Knowing that Tim Ferriss is an incredible business person, human guinea pig and an all round impressive individual, as soon as I finally found his full morning routine I jumped right on board.

And what are the results?
Was it effective? Will I do it again? Do I recommend it for others?

Yes...absolutely. It increased clarity in my mind and productivity. I can't imagine not doing my morning routine now. It's my time to prime myself for the day.

Disney/Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" opens in theatres in 3D June 15th, 2018.

Everyone’s favorite family of superheroes is back in “Incredibles 2” – but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.
 
Directed by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), “Incredibles 2” busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.

The Fab Factory is a 4-room, 3-booth studio owned by Shaun Fabos. Right away, clients and visitors (like ourselves!) are struck by the ""vibe"" of the space. Art covers the walls of the reception and lounge areas, and the studio actually doubles as a gallery exhibiting twice yearly. Shaun ensures that the Fab Factory feels creative at all times, allowing artists to do their best work in a comfortable space.

Each of the 4 rooms are designed for mixing, while 2 operate more as production suites. Jason LaRocca--an engineer, producer, and scoring mixer--first gave us a rundown of his setup. Jason runs Pro Tools with an Avid S3 controller, while a rack-mounted QSC unit provides 64 channels of I/O, onboard EQ and compression, and much of what of a traditional console offers. Because Jason's work involves mixing in 5.1/7.1 surround as well as stereo, the QSC functions similarly to the master section on a board, allowing him to swap speaker configurations as needed. He also has a nice collection of modular synthesizers in an A-100 rack, which he jokingly told us he plays with ""when Pro Tools crashes.""

Interviews: 
Shaun Fabos 0:49
Jason LaRocca 5:25
Michele Canova Iorfida 28:37
Dave Pensado 50:40

Of course, we also visited Dave Pensado in his Fab Factory home. Dave and I have been friends for many years now and had a lovely conversation about current and past projects, the state of rock music today, some of the equipment/techniques he uses, and much more! Dave mixes almost exclusively in-the-box, but he also has a selection of outboard gear that suits his style. A clever piece is the Bettermaker EQ 232 that opens as a plug-in controlled via the physical unit. Interestingly enough, Dave is also a fan of IK Multimedia's compact iLoud monitors which I use all the time!

Prior to Fab Factory, Dave worked out of Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles where he mixed on an SSL. It was around 2010 that he discovered he was doing better mixes in-the-box than on a console, and by Pro Tools 11, he couldn't beat what he was doing with a DAW. Of course, Dave champions whatever method best enhances the individual engineer's creativity, and speaks about the importance of being receptive to new techniques. This might include, for example, using certain plug-ins that allow panning of specific frequencies--a helpful hint he gave us for keeping mixes interesting!

As always, we hope you enjoy this look into Fab Factory Recording Studios and conversation with Dave Pensado.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

Today's episode of WHY IT MATTERS details and discusses Episode 7, how the Nintendo Switch completely proved wrong every Journalists outlet. Shortly, years ago, every publication website had explained that Nintendo should leave the console market. This continued on and went into Nintendo moving into Mobile development instead, and then proceeded to explain why consoles needed to end. Some articles even explained that Nintendo should license out their games to Microsoft and SONY.

But now, Nintendo Switch out sells the PS2 in the first year, moving over 10 Million consoles world wide within it's first year. The Nintendo Switch is a classic example of how predicting and telling a company what they should do is silly. Never forget how Nintendo has been down with the Virtual Boy, the GameCube, the Wii U... and yet are now much better off.

Girl, we see you. Taylor Swift shows up to the AMA’s in the sneakiest way possible

To everyone’s surprise Taylor Swift DID actually make an appearance at the AMA’s.

A lot of people were expecting to see Taylor Swift on the red carpet at the 2017 AMA’s since she just dropped her brand new album, Reputation about a week ago, but alas we didn’t see her Gorgeous self on the carpet or in the audience BUT that doesn’t mean she didn’t make a cameo. 

During a video tribute to Diana Ross, who was being honored with the AMA for Lifetime Achievement Taylor Swift made a video appearance to share her love and adoration for the Supremes singer. 

She started her heartfelt shout out by saying “Hey Diana, it's Taylor. I just want to say congratulations on your lifetime achievement award I want to say congratulations.
Then she went on to say how the singer has not only inspired her but everyone in the business today. 

We would all have to agree with Taylor on this one. Diana Ross is one of the most iconic women in music, and at 73 years old she is still killing it and I think it’s safe to say she’s already been the Lifetime Achievement award recipient for years, in our hearts. 
So were you surprised to not see Taylor at the AMA’s? And what did you think of her video tribute to queen Diana Ross. Let me know in the comments section and also don’t forget to subscribe to our channel. I’m your girl, Erin Robinson, and I’ll see you next time.

LYRICS: 

Working into the lab and I’m
Thinking about safety 
(Got goggles drawn, and labcoats on)
Open-toe shoes outta here
Are you going crazy?
(Things could go wrong, things could go wrong)
 
My gloves
They make me safe around chemicals, my chemicals
My love
Tie back your hair and prep materials, the materials

One; don’t you taste or sniff
You know you should be wafting if you’re taking a whiff
Two; don’t mix it in
Until the label’s checked again
Three; no food or drink
Unless you wanna have us find you dead in the morning
And if you follow this, you will mitigate the risk",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BRDApYgvDqQ/sddefault.jpg,0.054476292034107185,0.0007755507950897153,70.2420684486635,0.0015832628272478525,0.0552518428291969,0.056835105656444763,2018-04-17,16:43:33,Tuesday,1,8,65,8,51,39,483,3,82,2,4,5,16,0,1,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.782612854418125,5,"['scared', 'happy', 'happy', 'scared', 'neutral']",0,0,2,2,0,0,1,"{'bottle': 1, 'person': 6}",7

Let's break down what could potentially be the most important scene in The Last Jedi—and be forewarned, there are more spoilers ahead…

About MLB.com: Former Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League Club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's Internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the Internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live full length MLB game over the Internet when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com also provides fans with a stable of Club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, that deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.

Major League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels ; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.

BTAmaB2H3zI,teA0Z7ltRSY,Why is my iPhone so slow!?,TechSpank,28.0,2017-12-11 22:06:10+00:00,"['slow iphone', 'iphone battery fix', 'iphone battery', 'slow ios', 'is apple slowing down phones?', 'speed up my phone', 'make my iphone faster', 'iFixit', 'ifixit battery', 'iphone 6 slow', 'make iphone 6 faster']",25350.0,252.0,20.0,37.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BTAmaB2H3zI/default.jpg,"Is your iPhone slow as hell and does your battery life suck? Well guess what… those two things might be connected. And the fix is easier than you think. You might wanna hold off on buying that new iPhone for just a little bit longer.

This past weekend there was a bunch of chatter on reddit which then spilled over to MacRumors about allegations of apple throttling older phones with dying batteries. I just so happen to have an older iPhone 6 and the battery sucks and it seems to have gotten a lot slower since installing the new OS. AND, by total coincidence, I had ordered a replacement battery for it last week and it arrived today - so I thought it’d be a great way to perform an experiment.

The first thing I would suggest anyone watching this video to check is their battery health. Rechargeable batteries won’t be able to be recharged forever, and while iOS doesn’t really give specifics, there’s a warning that’ll appear letting you know if your battery is almost used up.  Head to settings, then click battery, and at the top of that screen there might be a message like this one saying that your iPhone battery may need to be serviced. Duh. I was lucky to get an hour out of the stupid thing.

Since I wanted to see if replacing the battery also made it FASTER, I decided to run some benchmark tests. First with the old battery. I did a hard reset and ran CPU Dasher X and saw a CPU frequency of 600, which is slower than it should be, weird. Then I ran geekbench. Note that the battery was actually at around 40% but the phone was plugged into a computer to capture the screen, which changes the time to 9:41 and the battery to 100%. Anyway, the results came in after 6 minutes and 22 seconds and the score was 745 for single core and 1233 for multi core. That’s slower than the 1463 it was supposed to be getting. So lets replace the battery and re-test.

CPU Dasher X has the CPU frequency at 1400, more than double the speed. That’s a really promising sign. How about geekbench? Well it finished 2 minutes and 30 seconds faster, and the results for both single and multi core are almost exactly double that of what I got with the old battery. 1467 and 2499 respectively. 

Now, I’m not here to answer WHY this is the way it happens. Maybe apple does that so even old phones can at least be used with crappy batteries. I mean, if they made it so the phones wouldn’t work at all then people would bitch and moan and they’d get sued. As it is now, I’m sure someone will still sue them over this, mark my words.
So, it seems like a dying battery WILL cause your iphone to run slowly, so if you have that error message I’d recommend bringing your iPhone to an apple store to get a new battery installed, of if you’re cheap and handy, like me, install a new battery on your own. I got mine from iFixIt and, as with the other times I’ve used their products in the show, they didn’t give me anything for free or any money to mention them, I just think they have a good, well tested product, unlike some of the cheap no-name crap you get on eBay and Amazon.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BTAmaB2H3zI/sddefault.jpg,0.009940828402366864,0.0007889546351084812,12.6,0.0014595660749506904,0.010729783037475344,0.012189349112426036,2017-12-11,22:06:10,Monday,0,6,32,6,25,26,215,2,35,0,0,1,0,4,4,4.0,6.0,"['RPEED UP', 'i', '', 'eon', '', 'vat iPHONE NOW!']","['RPEED', 'UP', 'i', 'eon', 'vat', 'iPHONE', 'NOW!']",True,"['rpeed', 'UP', 'i', 'eon', 'vat', 'iphon', 'now', '!']",8,8,23,1,1,0,3,6.396857372987688,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

In many cases, automation is changing the workforce faster than we can keep up. Manufacturers say they expect to have millions of unfilled positions. Adapting apprenticeship programs could help close the expanding wage and skills gaps by giving people another option for job training. 

If you're interested in reading more about the pros and cons to apprenticeships here are some helpful links that I used for my research:

That happens, any filmseries can have the occasional misfire. What is worrisome for Disney here, is that Solo isn’t just a fluke. Four pictures into their reign over Star Wars, the clear and unmistakable picture emerging is that of a downward trend. What this trajectory suggests, is that the public confidence in Star Wars is waning, and that the brand is in a state of decline. 

In this postmortem analysis, @AndreEinherjar will give his take on how things could spiral this far out of control, and what measures can be done to fix it. In so doing, he will begin by establishing how the original Star Wars trilogy became the institution it is regarded as, how Star Wars won the hearts and minds of generation upon generation since, and why Disney bought it in the first place.

Then he’ll describe how under Disney and Kathleen Kennedy’s Lucasfilms, the audience for Star Wars has been contracting; before  explaining why this happening, and the turmoil behind the scenes because of it.

Finally, suggestions for how they can course correct to get out of the quagmire Star Wars currently finds itself in will be provided.

LOOΠΔ [Chuu]

LOOΠΔ’s each member with her own distinctive character encounters each other to build up the universe. The first member HeeJin started off by meeting HyunJin, which then led to introduction of HaSeul to make three. While the youngest member, YeoJin, and ViVi from Hong Kong join, LOOΠΔ 1/3 was complete. [Love&Live], an album full with emotions of first crush, gets reversed to create [Love&Evil], an album with pain of first break-up to wrap up the first chapter of LOOΠΔ 1/3’s career.

LOOΠΔ creates another circle with LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE with girls who prefer to take charge in a relationship, KimLip, JinSoul, and Choerry. They mix and match through [Mix&Match] to the maximum level of [Max&Match], while LOOΠΔ developed the depth of their music, visuals, and storytelling to the next level.

We all wonder who the last member is going to be. The start of the new unit took off with Yves, and now the tenth member of LOOΠΔ, Chuu, reveals herself to bring a new wind into the universe of LOOΠΔ.

The new single lets the fans take a peek into what JiWoo, who has already been a popular trainee among fans, had to go through to become ‘Chuu’, and her desire to be loved by Yves, who also has said in her lyrics, “my heart that wants to be like you gets colored, filled with you.”

The titled track “Heart Attack” does not interpret the feelings of being in love in a serious way, but with Chuu’s own adorable emoticon-like ways. The music video has references to historical and fictional figures such as the artist Rene Magritte, Hans Christian Andersen’s short story “The Little Match Girl”, and John Appleby’s novel “Aphrodite Means Death”.

The supporting track “Girl’s Talk” is a duet by Chuu and Yves, a rendition of a daily dialogue between two girls. Sweet but sometimes secretive, the precious chats between the girls get reinterpreted to become a song. G-High of Monotree, who has produced HeeJin’s “ViViD” and LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE’s “Uncover”, crafts the track to perfection to prove the quality

When four girls who denied the garden of Eden gathers, the party begins.

🎵 Drake - God's Plan Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

[Chorus 1]
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
I make sure that north-side eat

[Post-Chorus]
And still
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yuh, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
She say, ""Do you love me?"" I tell her, ""Only partly""
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies

[Chorus 2]
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh

[Post-Chorus]
And still
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah

BWK7omTBs60,hIcR65h2GDs,Oprah & 5 More Celebs Who Might Run For President In 2020,Clevver News,24.0,2018-01-15 16:00:01+00:00,"['Oprah', 'katy perry', 'will smith', 'Dwayne Johnson', 'George Clooney', 'Kanye', 'celebs running for president', 'celeb presidents', 'News', 'newsfeed', 'entertainment', 'clevver news']",25592.0,864.0,94.0,377.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BWK7omTBs60/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

If you’re not a Kanye fan, don’t worry. The list of celebs who might run for President in 2020 is pretty lengthy. So there will be plenty to choose from!
Honestly, at this point in our lifetime, there’s a pretty big chance that one of your faves is considering on running for President. First to kick off our long list of celebs who might run for presidency in 2020 is none other than Oprah Winfrey.
While Oprah DID set the internet ablaze after her inspiring acceptance speech at the 2018 Golden Globes, with many calling her to make an official announcement, it was this comment she during in an old interview with David Rubenstein on Bloomberg that had many people crossing their fingers for an Oprah 2020 campaign.
Since then, O’s BFF Gayle King has shut down rumors of a possible presidency run, I’m pretty sure a huge chunk of people on the internet still have their fingers – including me.
And of course, how could we forget Mr. West. Kanye was basically one of the first celebrities to declare his potential 2020 candidacy and he did so at the VMAs in 2016. After his super long Video Vanguard award acceptance speech, Yay shocked us all by announcing his decision to run for president.
I don’t think anyone saw that one coming. Though we still haven’t heard anything else from Yeezy or his camp about his potential run, it’s still a little early to count Kanye out of the running.
Katy is another notable celeb who has dabbled in the idea of running to become the 46th President. When Hilary ran for president during the 2016 election, Katy was one of her BIGGEST supporters, so with her involvement in politics during that time, a KP 2020 run might not be too crazy of an idea.
Especially when she shared a photo of herself posing between former President George W. Bush and Bill Clinton with the caption ’42, 43, 46?!’ And even if she barely has any experience in politics, take a look at Donald Trump. He barely had any before he became President and look at where he is now! Anything is possible, people!
The Rock has also thrown his name into the hat. At the end of 2017, he made it known on Ellen that he’s seriously considering the idea of running for president and in an interview with USA Today, he basically revealed that he never gave the idea much thought until he saw that many people were pretty excited about the possible of a Rock presidency.
The Rock said QUOTE, “So I can tell you with honesty that the consideration comes at the desire from a large amount of people who would like to see this happen. But I mean, honestly, there are so many different variables that have to come into play when you think about this. Politics is not my business. So the consideration is there. And we’ll just have to see. I’ll continue to watch and learn as much as I can.”
In the past, Will Smith has saved the Earth many times from aliens and robots and supervillains on the big screen, and now it sounds like he might make it his mission to save the United States by running for president.
So he hasn’t necessarily ruled out the idea of running for president some day, but if one day Will decides he’s totally against it, can he pass the idea along to Jada Pinkett-Smith?
And last but certainly not least, we have George Clooney and to be honest, that idea isn’t too farfetched. George is a HUGE activist who has donated money and worked tirelessly to bring awareness to prevent mass atrocities and genocides. Not to mention he has had quite a few family members who have dabbled in politics.
When asked if he would run for president during a red carpet George said QUOTE, “Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I’d like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.”
George Clooney for president, anybody? You just know that together he and Amal would make the world a better place.
Let me know who you’re most likely to vote for President from this list and if you’re not interested in ANY of these possible candidates, leave your thoughts on who you think SHOULD run for president in the comment section below. When you’re done with that, click right over here to check out some of the CRAZIEST Trump quotes.

Get ready to sing and dance, laugh and love all over again.

Ten years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.

Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BWnKGYnuE8o/sddefault.jpg,0.0054409087241452355,0.00014851067436857232,36.63648251062439,0.00016865841214659048,0.005589419398513806,0.005758077810660396,2018-05-10,15:00:14,Thursday,3,14,63,14,54,71,475,5,82,1,2,12,56,5,2,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.544762549603447,3,"['sad', 'sad', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,2,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

FAQs:

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.

Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?
A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://shop.simonscat.com/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BWsRpT9LNcQ/sddefault.jpg,0.021794861963017213,0.00019081894710345408,114.21749408983452,0.0005025350049012952,0.02198568091012067,0.022488215915021963,2017-12-14,13:07:58,Thursday,3,7,63,7,52,36,533,4,125,1,0,2,10,0,3,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.3744534805168254,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

You still couldn’t recognise
That your problem lies within
In a vicious circle
Can you tell me why
Why you’ve thrown it all away
Cos it makes no sense to me
Why you wouldn’t listen

Watching you decline
What were you expecting
I can’t save you from yourself
When you don’t want saving
It’s on your head
Don’t point the finger point the blame
Cos the warning signs were clear
You just wouldn’t listen

I know it hurts
Tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won’t mean anything
I hope it hurts
You’ve only got yourself to blame
And I can’t take this anymore
I’m over it
So over it

Breathe in breathe out
I feel it coming round again
Breathe in breathe out
Don’t wanna ride your carousel
Breathe in breathe out
Don’t know how much more I can take
Breathe in breathe out
Just stop cos I'm about to break

ミニチュア唐揚げ弁当作り
スーパーやコンビニで売られていそうなお弁当をイメージしてミニチュア唐揚げ弁当を作ってみました。唐揚げはケンタッキーの時とほぼ同じ作り方でポテサラは初ですがなかなかよかったんです。がしかしご飯は盛り付けで接着剤に加える水の量を間違えて粒がべちゃつくという単純なミスを犯してしまいました。次回がんばります。
ちなみにプチトマトのヘタがないのは「作るのを忘れた」ではなく、「食中毒予防ためヘタをとってある」という設定です。

About Fortnite Battle Royale:

Fortnite is an first-person poot and toot. Be careful not to get attacked by the giant cupcakes as you defend yourself from the incoming wave of small children. Choose from an assortment of pew pews such as the water gun, the musket, the blunderbus, and the musketbus. Build huge pantries to store all your turquoise valuables and remain vigilant while enemies tickle your weenus.

LYRICS

Not by might Not by power By your spirit God Send your spirit God

You are the fire We are the temple You are the voice We are your song You are our God We are your people You are the light We stand in awe We stand in awe of you

Not by might Not by power By your spirit Send your spirit God

You called us out Out of the darkness Into your love , into your light Grace upon grace Beauty for ashes You come to us. We come alive

We stand in awe of you We stand in awe of you

Not by might Not by power By your spirit God
Send your spirit God

Breathe, come and breathe on us Spirit breathe on us

We stand in awe of you

Not by might Not by power By your spirit Send your spirit God

Breathe , come and breathe on us Spirit breathe on us

It also looks like Winterfell is preparing it's defenses for the Great War.. The Night King and his Army are South so it's only a matter of time before they reach Winterfell..

Sandra Lanshin Chiu, L.Ac. is an acupuncturist and herbalist who specializes in treating and rejuvenating skin using the tools of Chinese medicine. She is also, btw...43 years old as of 2018...and uses this technique on herself regularly in addition to her clients.

Facial Gua Sha is an important natural technique that increases the health and vitality of skin as a way of restoring youthful glow, contouring and lifting, smoothing, de-congesting, de-puffing, and brightening the skin. 

This tutorial is designed so that you can follow along at home and learn this deeply calming, restorative and beautifying practice. It is a condensed version of our 2-hour hands-on class taught at Treatment by Lanshin in Brooklyn, NY (and sometimes LA, SF, DC).

Caution: For those with sensitive skin, rosacea, eczema or other reactive skin disorder please consult your dermatologist or skincare professional for guidance on your skin before trying any of these techniques.

🎙️Lyrics
If I show I'm fragile
Would you go ahead and find somebody else?
And if I act too tough, know that I care bout you
I'm honest, no offense
No, I could never fake it
Like players always playing
Arrest me if I hurt you
But no apologies for being me
I just wanna be pure
You know I'm terrible at putting up a show, oh
That's what you wanted me for?
So I get pissed off when you ask me to be more
Oh, I just wanna be raw
Oh, I just wanna be raw
Keeping up appearances
But sometimes, all we need's a little break
Regret the stupid shit I say
I hope that you forgive me any day
No, I could never fake it
Like players always playing
Arrest me if I hurt you
But no apologies for being me
I just wanna be pure
You know I'm terrible at putting up a show, oh
That's what you wanted me for?
So I get pissed off when you ask me to be more
Oh, I just wanna be raw
Oh, I just wanna be raw
That's what you wanted me, that's what you wanted me
That's what you wanted me for?
No, I just wanna be, no, I just wanna be
I just wanna be raw
Arrest me if I hurt you
But no apologies for being me
I just wanna be pure
You know I'm terrible at putting up a show, oh
That's what you wanted me for?
So I get pissed off when you ask me to be more
Oh, I just wanna be raw
Oh, I just wanna be raw
I just wanna be raw

Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is drafted against her will to become a “sparrow,” a trained seductress in the Russian security service. Dominika learns to use her body as a weapon, but struggles to maintain her sense of self during the dehumanizing training process. Finding her power in an unfair system, she emerges as one of the program’s strongest assets. Her first target is Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), a CIA officer who handles the agency’s most sensitive infiltration of Russian intelligence. The two young operatives fall into a spiral of attraction and deception, which threatens their careers, allegiances and the security of both countries. Based on the book by former CIA officer Jason Matthews, “Red Sparrow” reunites Jennifer Lawrence with her “Hunger Games” director, Francis Lawrence with Joel Edgerton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Charlotte Rampling, Mary-Louise Parker and Jeremy Irons rounding out the cast.

Director: Francis Lawrence
Screenplay by Justin Haythe
Based on novel by Jason Matthews
Produced by Peter Chernin and Steve Zaillian

In this video we will have a closer look at the subject of magnetic levitation. At first we will talk about the theory on how to achieve the suspension of a magnet in midair and then we will create a crude levitator circuit that did not work very well but still showcased how the main principle works.

“Danny wanted us to make him a carbon trials bike” explains Nic McCrae, composites engineer at Santa Cruz. “I had no idea what kind of journey that was going to be, but it sounded like there’d be a whole lot of new stuff to learn working on a project like this so I just said yes, and used it as an opportunity to take our in-house R&D facility to the next level.”

The in-house composites lab at Santa Cruz was initially set up for the wheels program. The testing here is what resulted in the distinctive spoke reinforcement profiles found on Reserve rims today. It features all the equipment you’d expect in a carbon lab—cutting table, prepreg freezer etc.—but also a few things you won’t find anywhere else, like a heat press we designed and built in-house.

Listen here : http://queennaija.lnk.to/EPYD

LYRICS:
(Verse 1)
You tell me you love me,
but I ain't been feeling it lately
you say you love keeping me fly but
can't keep me from looking' so crazy
come in at 6 in the mornin'
where you been, where you been
who is that texting your phone,
just a friend, just a friend (okay)

my intuition never lies
there's nothing you can ever hide
already got the screenshots
so there is no need to deny,
you been creepin' and freakin' and sneakin'
like you'll never lose me
steady claiming that everyone know we together
but you steady choosing

(PRE HOOK)
 Swear I cannot win for losing
I been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
but that ain't been keeping us stable
so I guess I know what I gotta do
give you a taste of your own medicine (hey, yeah)

(CHORUS)
How would you like it if I do the things you do
put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
imma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
give another guy everything that belongs to you
Imma call up Brian, Imma FaceTime Ryan
Imma text Lorenzo, Imma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

(VERSE 2)
You don't like it,
now you telling' me that I should fight it
why you be out here playing the victim,
when I am the one who been cryin'
why dish it out but can't take it,
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
when I drop my clothes and get naked
not for you, but for him,
now tell me player, how does that make you feel?
how could you play me when the love I gave was REAL,
I even took you back and you still had no chill

(PRE HOOK)
Boy you aint gone ever learn,
play with fire you get burned,
I don't think you'll understand
until I hit you where it hurts,
so I guess I know what I gotta do,
give you a taste of your own medicine

(REPEAT CHORUS)

ALL OF THOSE TEARS I CRIED,
I CAN'T COUNT THE LONELY NIGHTS,
TIME AND TIME AGAIN I'VE TRIED,
SO WHEN I TURN INTO A SAVAGE BOY DON'T ASK ME WHY

For years, they tried to get him to go. They sent him five eviction notices, they gave him money to move somewhere else, but he refused. We thought this was an interesting topic, so we went out on the street and asked people 'Do you still live with your parents?' in a new #PedestrianQuestion.

FAQs:

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.

Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?
A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://shop.simonscat.com/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkIuZVGTkM0/sddefault.jpg,0.022520823939627826,0.00017570575143493032,128.17351598173516,0.0005736511976071924,0.02269652969106276,0.023270180888669948,2017-11-30,13:00:01,Thursday,3,9,67,9,56,44,555,4,134,1,0,4,10,0,3,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.384646444415188,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Se quer mesmo saber
Vou te contar
Mas pensando melhor chega mais perto 
Que eu vou te mostrar

Te juro pela luz
Da lua cheia
Que vai valer a pena
E é uma pena você não topar

Seu beijo causou
Perda de memória
E outras coisas mais que eu já
Nem lembro agora
Nem quero lembrar

E assim que a sua roupa encostar no chão
Eu dou Check-out desse mundo
E Check-In no seu colchão

안녕하세요 오늘은 바나나 우유 레시피를 준비했어요 
딸기우유는 딸기 시럽을 끓여 만들었는데 바나나도 끓여보니 슈 반죽처럼 떡이 되더라구요 
그래서 으깨고 설탕만 섞어 만들었어요 잘라 넣는 바나나 양은 취향에 맞게~ 
저는 으깨는 바나나 1개, 잘라 넣는 바나나 1개 사용했어요
바나나에도 단맛이 있어서 설탕을 안넣고도 만들어 봤는데 좀 밍밍 하더라구요 
설탕을 조금 넣는게 훨씬 맛있습니다!! 

▶재료 (1인분) 
바나나 2개, 설탕 20g, 우유 200ml

1) 바나나 1개를 으깨줍니다 
2) 설탕을 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다 
3) 나머지 바나나를 작게 잘라줍니다
4) 으깬 바나나와 자른 바나나를 컵이나 보틀에 담아줍니다
5) 우유를 부어 잘 섞어줍니다 

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! So why not start it with a real big old, heavy-duty, breakfast hash. Maybe you had a colorful night and in the morning you want to refresh yourself with colorful breakfast hash. You can put whatever you want in a hash, and it's yours. But this one is Matty's and here's how to make it.

Sauté everything in a pan, add a couple pockets of melty cheese, stick it in the oven for around 15 min and there you go! Breakfast Hash!

The acclaimed series, from the creative team of writer Peter Morgan (The Queen) and director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot), charts the riveting inside story of Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street in the second half of the 20th century. And the new season takes us into the revolutionary era of the 1960s, when deference for the Crown came up against unprecedented calls for social and political liberation.

Hear from Claire Foy (Queen Elizabeth II) and Matt Smith (Philip, Duke of Edinburgh) from this celebrated drama when they pay a visit to 92Y. The Crown Season 2 launches on Netflix December 8.

Recorded on December 4, 2017 at 92nd Street Y.

I went back to El Salvador (where I was born) to find my birth mother. I was adopted at 1 year old and have grown up my entire life in Massachusetts. 

I went to college in Washington, DC and settled in NYC soon after. In the last year, I've become much more curious about my culture, my country of origin, and my birth mother. 

After seeing the movie Lion, I realized that it was 100% possible that I could find her. I just had to put my mind to the task. I booked a trip to El Salvador and this video shows what happened...

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BmdooBIoZn0/sddefault.jpg,0.009489358539183866,0.00013214076294773008,71.8125,0.000701997803159816,0.009621499302131596,0.010323497105291412,2018-03-07,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,6,37,6,32,34,326,0,76,0,1,5,16,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.340344948480105,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

⭐⭐DESCRIPTION⭐⭐

The long awaited third part to our Fortnite vs PUBG series is finally here. This is the sequel to Fortnite vs PUBG 2 which the sequel to our first fortnite short film we made. If you haven't seen them, I suggest you watch the first one(s) first before you continue onto this one.

This series is essentially about PUBG players exploring the world of fortnite. There are obvious differences between fortnite and player unknown battlegrounds such as building and other unrealistic mechanics. This is essentially a fortnite parody of what would happen when pubg meets fortnite.

Hope you guys enjoy.

Now hair braiders and politicians are fighting back against policies they claim disproportionately affect immigrant women of color.

From Mexico's creepy Island of the Dolls to the Naval Base on Diego Garcia 


#9. “Island of Socotra”- Off the coast of Somalia in the Indian ocean is an island that seems as though it belongs on another planet. Socotra Island has long been theorized as a location for the biblical Garden of Eden, and just by looking at pictures of it you can see why. The island is home to several species of plants that are can’t be found anywhere else on Earth. There are the Dr. Seuss looking Adenium socotranum which have big bulbous trunks and tiny gnarly branches that sprout from their tops and bear flowers that are a marvelous shade of pink. There odd appearance makes them kind of look like giant root vegetables. Then there are the Dragon’s Blood Trees which look like perfect natural umbrellas. The have trunks that resemble that of an average tree but their thick tightly bunched branches shoot upwards and form a mushroom like crown. Socotra is also home to three geographically unique species of bird: the socotra sunbird, socotra grosbeak and socotra starling. There aren’t many other creatures that inhabit the island other than that of bats and insects and the last time it was home to man was around the year 100 A.D. Adding to the mystery, the island has been the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the years.

#8. “Palmyra Atoll”- Though technically not an island but an atoll that formed from coral the mysterious nature of Palmyra Atoll cannot be ignored. Also known as Palmyra Island, the breathtakingly beautiful ringlet sits between American Samoa and Hawaii. Though it is full of lush vegetation and appears unblemished by man the island has long be the subject of superstition and folktales. There have been several cases of violent shipwrecks and mysterious disappearances of ships on and around the island. Those who have observed the island and survived to tell their tale have claimed having seen some extremely bizarre sights like that of floating lights, ghosts and sea monsters. It is also reported to be the home of an incredible amount of sharks who may have developed a distinct taste for humans. There is also the story of lost Incan treasure that may still be on the island. These tales and others which cannot be discussed do to their graphic nature have made Palmyra the stuff of legend amongst sailors and Pacific Islanders for centuries.

#7. “Vulcan Island”- Vulcan Island in the Philippines isn’t necessarily an island that is shrouded in mystery but it definitely is a mindblowing locale. On the northern Philippine island of Luzon there sits a lake named Taal and in that lake there is an island called Taal Volcano, inside this island is the world’s largest crater lake and inside of this lake there sits yet another island, known as Vulcan Island. Not only is Vulcan Island one of the most fascinating of natural recursion it happens to be located on one of the most active volcanoes in the entire Pacific Ocean. Because of this fact it is incredibly dangerous to visit Vulcan Island as it has been quaking and bubbling consistently since 1991.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bntj6OCe2_g/sddefault.jpg,0.00440413606838546,0.0004858416252739343,9.064962406015038,0.0002887287373056524,0.004889977693659394,0.005178706430965047,2018-03-08,13:00:01,Thursday,3,6,55,6,42,35,440,1,73,1,0,4,0,2,8,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5665669735308825,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Kratos is the main protagonist and anti-hero of the God of War series. Born a Spartan, Kratos held the military rank of General, and would ascend to being a God before exacting his revenge on the Olympians who betrayed him.
God of War is an action-adventure, hack and slash, mythology-based video game series, originally created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. Debuting in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console, the series has become a flagship title for the PlayStation brand, consisting of eight games across multiple platforms. The series' story centers around its playable character, Kratos, a Spartan warrior tricked into killing his wife and daughter by his former master, the Greek God of War Ares. Kratos kills Ares at the behest of the goddess Athena and takes his place as the new God of War, but is still haunted by the nightmares of his past. Revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods who betrays Kratos, the Spartan then seeks revenge against the gods for their machinations. What follows is a series of attempts to free himself from the influence of the Olympian gods, as well as the Titans, and exact revenge. Many years after taking his revenge against the Greek gods, Kratos ends up in the world of the Norse gods with a son named Atreus and takes a turn for the good.

Full Review here: https://techfordaddy.com/keep-your-coffee-hot-for-hours-the-ember-mug-review-video/

I am a HUGE coffee drinker. I will have 3-4 cups per day but by the end of my 3rd cup it starts to get cold. I did a little research and came across the Ember Mug that says it can keep your coffee hot for hours.

I have never thought of trying a smart coffee mug before and, at $70, I was skeptical. I bought one anyway just to test it out and I was pleasantly surprised!

The Ember Mug battery lasts over an hour and the Ember app is very easy to use and is very responsive. It kept my coffee at 130 degrees for over 3 hours while putting it on and off the charging coaster.

If you are someone that stays close to their desk most of the day and like warm coffee without having to rush and drink it before it gets cold, this is a great product! Check it out in the link above!

But they often drown in the Mediterranean or are left stranded in transit countries where they face torture, rape and forced labour.

People trafficking in Libya has provoked an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

The UN-backed government in Libya is promising to increase the number of flights repatriating stranded migrants.

And Libya’s Ambassador to the United Nations says the slave auction video will be fully investigated.

So,how can illegal migration be controlled in a failed state?

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Marvel is always throwing us into action-packed films with superheroes we could watch for days. They are known for their high production value and great casts, but sometimes even the greatest of the great make mistakes. So despite Marvel racking in some of the highest blockbuster grosses of all time, we still caught the mistakes they hoped nobody would ever notice.

Their films star such famous actors as Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Donald Glover, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Paul Bettany to name a few. The films included in the MCU range from “The Avengers” to “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Thor: Ragnarok,” and the new “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” But what’s happened in these films and more than perk up our senses? In “Iron Man” and “Thor” what is up with the speed of sound? And does Doctor Strange not know proper medical procedures? How about Black Panther’s shoes, made by Shuri, that aren’t as silent as they’re said to be? And of course, there’s one mistake in “Avengers: Infinity War” we’re not one caught, as we’re all too busy watching Ebony Maw tying up Strange.

We’ll reveal all these and even more mistakes we caught in the Marvel films. Watch until the end and count how many mistakes you caught or how many you can go back and find for yourself! Wait until you see what mistake Black Widow has hidden from the world…or is it another superpower?

Featuring: 

Entry 1 BLACK PANTHER NOT SO SILENT
Entry 2 DOCTOR STRANGE: THE DIRTY SURGEON 
Entry 3 GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2, WHAT FOOTWEAR?
Entry 4 RAGNAROK APPEARING OBJECTS

 Rainbow Six Siege is an exciting, new approach to the first-person shooter experience that puts tactical combat and masterful destruction at the center of the action.

 -WORLD'S ELITE COUNTER-TERRORIST OPERATORS: Choose your Operator and wield their unique ability to breach or defend the objective as a part of an elite team.
 -DESTRUCTION AS A TOOL: Walls can be shattered; floors and ceilings can be breached. Mastering the tactical use of destruction is the key to victory.

Acting can take on performers in a number of different ways. Some actors go through physical transformations for roles, some go through emotional transformations, and some go through both. For some of Hollywood’s greatest actors, signing up for a movie completely changed their lives forever. Some would quit acting while others had to completely change the way they lived their life.

Gene Hackman had an illustrious film career, but his older age was getting to him and he reached his breaking point with a Ray Romano comedy film. Jake Lloyd was cast as the young version of Darth Vader, but having such a prominent role led to a huge downfall for the actor. George Clooney did his own stunts in Syriana and got severely injured when one of the stunts went horribly wrong. Shelly Duvall dedicated four months to filming of the intense film The Shining and was put through literal hell to get her scenes films. Bill Skarsgard completely transformed for the role of Pennywise the clown in IT, but the haunting may have turned around on him. Bob Hoskins starred alongside cartoons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it was the animated world which took over his own head. Colin Firth had to learn a stutter for The King’s Speech and then had to un-learn the speaking inconsistencies for his own personal life. Linda Hamilton learned what it was like to take on the Terminator. Watch to see all these actors and how they transformed along with several others!

Han desarrollado espectáculos majestuosos interpretando música alternativa y el llamado rock celta, del que Enya es también una destacada representante. Fue fundada por Nial Quinn, a quien se unieron los hermanos Mike y Noel Hogan, y Fergal Lawlweer. Tras la renuncia del vocalista Quinn, se unió al resto de la banda la cantante Dolores O'Riordan, quien además compuso muchos de sus temas.
O'Riordan  nación en Limerick (Irlanda) el 6 de Septiembre de 1971, y falleció, a los 46 años, el 15 de Enero del 2018 en Londres (Inglaterra). En el 2007 comenzó una carrera en solitario, y a la fecha de su muerte se encontraba grabando una nueva versión de su éxito ""Zombie"" con la banda Bad Wolves.
""Zombie""  es uno de sus más importantes sucesos. Fue escrita por Dolores O'Riordan e incluida en el disco ""No Need to Argue"" publicado en 1994. La letra es hermosa, y habla del anhelo independenista del pueblo irlandés, y sus luchas por más de un siglo. Para la cantautora la canción es un tema de paz entre Irlanda e Inglaterra, y fue escrita a raíz de un bombardeo británico en Irlanda del Norte en el que perecieron dos niños, y que desencadenó una ola de protestas en esa parte de Europa.
La traducción al español de una parte del tema, dice:
""Otra madre se está quebrando,
El corazón está sufriendo,
Cuando la violencia causa silencio
Nosotros debemos estar equivocados.
Es el mismo viejo tema desde 1916
En tu cabeza,
En tu cabeza ellos aún están luchando
Con sus tanques, y sus bombas,
Y sus bombas, y sus armas,
En tu cabeza,
En tu cabeza ellos están muriendo.
En tu cabeza, en tu cabeza
Zombie, zombie, zombie...""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtV1-gJ_bm0/sddefault.jpg,0.005111299457198661,0.00026817010623422967,19.059915100060643,0.00014981097747906146,0.00537946956343289,0.005529280540911953,2018-01-16,20:40:42,Tuesday,1,4,16,4,16,24,123,1,19,0,0,3,12,1,0,5.0,7.0,"['ty Pree ABER Mi', '', 'PL AAMMOL', '', '     ', '', 'hill edit os', '', 'Ds', '', '   ', '', 'C AAP EPP ys']","['ty', 'Pree', 'ABER', 'Mi', 'PL', 'AAMMOL', 'hill', 'edit', 'os', 'Ds', 'C', 'AAP', 'EPP', 'ys']",True,"['ty', 'pree', 'aber', 'Mi', 'PL', 'aammol', 'hill', 'edit', 'os', 'Ds', 'C', 'aap', 'epp', 'ys']",14,14,41,0,2,3,0,7.1175307200606674,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

VIDEO DESCRIPTION:
On February 6, SpaceX launched their new “Falcon Heavy” Rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.
In a spectacular and very media-effective stunt they sent a “midnight-cherry-red"" Tesla Roadster as test-payload on it’s way into deep space.
The rocket has the ability to put more than 140,000 pounds of cargo into the lower earth orbit, much more than anyone has commercially requested them to do. That makes it by far the most powerful operational rocket in the world. And SpaceX is already developing an even more powerful one.
The BFR, which will be more than 106 meters high and carry up to 550,000 pounds into Lower Earth Orbit.

Lyrics
Written by Cory Asbury, Steffany Gretzinger, and Amanda Cook

Verse 1
Take me by the hand and
Walk with me by quiet streams
I need to hear the wind and
Feel the ground beneath my feet

Pre-Chorus
‘Cause You’re the only friend
Who can set my soul at ease

Chorus
In the quiet pride of my Father’s eyes
I remember who I am
When I feel the warmth of my Father’s smile
Feels like I’ve been born again
I’ve been born again 

Verse 2
Realign my heart and
Help me keep the first things first
Let me hear Your whisper and
God, I hang on every word",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bu9KiisQddo/sddefault.jpg,0.017790878380843287,0.00018386242421147096,96.76190476190477,0.00041442006727029966,0.01797474080505476,0.018389160872325058,2018-03-01,21:37:23,Thursday,3,3,12,3,12,21,100,2,23,0,0,3,0,1,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.527901669308938,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,{'person': 2},2

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again! 

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi! 

Big hugs,

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BwURD8IHuwk/sddefault.jpg,0.01492238059316314,0.0004307777821892246,34.640552995391715,0.0007980307301385638,0.015353158375352362,0.016151189105490932,2018-03-02,09:35:01,Friday,4,9,38,8,33,49,330,1,76,0,1,7,17,4,0,5.0,8.0,"['ee', '= JAMES', 'Pra']","['ee', '=', 'JAMES', 'Pra']",True,"['ee', '=', 'jame', 'pra']",4,4,10,1,0,0,0,6.84606315053037,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

Based on the much-loved novel by Ian McEwan (Atonement) and brought to the big screen by director Richard Eyre (Notes on a Scandal, Iris), THE CHILDREN ACT is a compelling and powerful drama telling the story of Fiona Maye (Emma Thompson), an eminent high court judge presiding over ethically complex cases. As the demands of her job cause her marriage to Jack (Stanley Tucci) to reach tipping point, Fiona is asked to rule on the case of Adam (Fionn Whitehead), a brilliant young boy who is refusing a life-saving blood transfusion on religious grounds. With her private life in turmoil, Fiona finds herself drawn into the case, taking the unorthodox step of halting proceedings in order to visit Adam in hospital. As the two form a profound connection and powerful emotions come to light, Fiona’s judgement is put to the test with momentous consequences as she must ultimately decide whether Adam lives or dies.

Starring  EMMA THOMPSON, STANLEY TUCCI, FIONN WHITEHEAD
Based on the acclaimed novel by IAN MCEWAN.

Nearly a decade after the series premiere of Jersey Shore, the cast is back together again for Jersey Shore Family Vacation. For better or worse, reality stars Snooki, The Situation, JWoww, Paul D and the rest. They have all changed over the years except for Pauly D. In this video we will be taking a look at their drastic body transformations, and what made the changes happen--from plastic surgery, to diet, to good old fashion gtl.

At first glance, the design – which featured in a Swedish women's magazine – appears much like an ordinary IKEA advert promoting the brand's Sundvick baby crib.

Not believe with UFO. Talk with this pilot

A video shows a 2004 encounter near San Diego between two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets and an unknown object. It was released by the Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. 

By Courtesy of U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE on Publish Date December 16, 2017. Photo by U.S Department of Defense

The two pilots, Cmdr. David Fravor and Lt. Cmdr. Jim Slaight, flew so close to the location of the aircraft that their radar signatures couldn’t be separated from the unknown object’s. They then noticed that the sea appeared to be churning before the scene descended into utter fucking madness, per the Times:

Hovering 50 feet above the churn was an aircraft of some kind—whitish—that was around 40 feet long and oval in shape. The craft was jumping around erratically, staying over the wave disturbance but not moving in any specific direction, Commander Fravor said. The disturbance looked like frothy waves and foam, as if the water were boiling.

Story
When the aircraft approached, Fravor told the paper, “It accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen” and disappeared, causing him to be “pretty weirded out.” But then something happened that weirded him out even more. When the jets began to retreat to another position 60 miles away, radar showed the object reappeared there in less than a minute.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BxuSA9o1_vQ/sddefault.jpg,0.0006068321383577276,5.936401353499511e-05,10.222222222222221,0.0002176680496283153,0.0006661961518927228,0.0008838642015210381,2017-12-16,19:34:15,Saturday,5,8,8,8,8,53,63,0,13,2,3,5,5,0,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.9459991009385935,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'tv': 1},1

Lyrics:
There goes my heart beating
Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now

There goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

There goes my hands shaking
Cause you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
And I need you now

If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
You are the reason
Yeah, yeah...

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

It was created by car part manufacturer Toyoda Gosei, and it was shown off at the Toyko Motor Show. LED lighting gives the car some personality, but the lights do more than make faces. They are actually meant to communicate with passengers and pedestrians. The exterior airbags absorb the impact of a collision and are supposed to instantly repair any dents. The outside material is a soft shape-changing rubber and its body shape will change during high-speed driving to resist wind. Most concept cars never go into production, but Toyoda hopes the car will hit the streets in 2030. Flesby proves you can never be too safe.

Company Wigetworks have created AirFish-8, a boat/plane hybrid that glides on water. Due to the machines unique structure, it is able to utilise what is known as the ""Wing in Ground Effect."" This is when an aircraft is able to produce additional lift when flying near the ground.

AirFish-8 has a V8 car engine, which runs on unleaded petrol and can travel up to 121 mph; that's three times faster than typical marine craft. 

The sea-craft is currently still in a trial phase but the company hope to have it fully operational by mid-2018.

If you said SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket you’d be wrong! (its body is aluminum)

Move over SpaceX, there’s a new kid on the block! Well, maybe not move over, but pull up a chair to the orbital class rocket table! That’s right, Rocket Lab has officially become the second privately owned rocket company to achieve orbit with their beautiful Electron rocket.

Today we’re going to give you a deep run down on some of the exciting features about the Electron, then we’re going to compare it to similar rockets including other upcoming small sat rockets, and past small sat rockets like SpaceX’s Falcon 1. 

We’re even going to throw in a Falcon 9 for comparison and see which rocket takes the cake for the cheapest ride to space with a cost per kilogram comparison. Oh, and I mean it when I say cake, I got this for the winner.

1) Gambit movie back on track; casting has begun w/ Lizzy Caplan in talks

2) Plot details revealed for Tarantino’s 1969 movie

3) Opening This Week

4) New Phantom Thread Teaser and Sneak Preview Dates

The long developed, long delayed X-Men spin-off Gambit starring Channing Tatum looks to be back on track now as Variety is reporting that Lizzy Caplan is in talks to join the cast as a lead in the film; though her role is being kept under wraps at this time. The movie had its fair share of problems over the years, with two separate directors leaving the project over creative differences before the script went back to the drawing board for a re-write. Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski is attached to direct, with a release date set for February 14th, 2019.

In a new article from Vanity Fair, plot details have been revealed for Quentin Tarantino’s much anticipated movie that recently landed at Sony. The untitled film, going by the working title #9, takes place in the summer of 1969 in Los Angeles and follows “a male TV actor who’s had one hit series and is looking for a way to get into the film business. His sidekick—who’s also his stunt double—is looking for the same thing.” Vanity Fair notes that the murder of Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson family serves as a backdrop to the main story. Filming is set to begin in June 2018 for a 2019 release yet to be determined.

OPENING THIS WEEK

BUY OR SELL

Focus Features has released a new teaser for the upcoming drama Phantom Thread, which reveals that sneak preview screenings for writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson’s newest movie will be taking place in New York and Los Angeles from November 24th through November 30th. Set in 1950s London, the film stars Daniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock, a high-society dressmaker whose life is upended when he comes across a young, strong-willed woman. The movie is set to open wide on December 25th later this year.

A new Star Wars: The Last Jedi TV has been released, this time further teasing Rey’s journey in the movie and the temptations that may arise from the Dark Side. The epic eighth chapter in the Skywalker saga is ready to debut in under one month’s time, and stars Mark Hamill, the late Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Gwendoline Christie along with newcomers Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro. It opens in regular and IMAX theaters on December 15.
