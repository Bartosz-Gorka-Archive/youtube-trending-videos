Alright what's going on guys it's Trev back again here to bring you another video.  In this episode we will be doing our post live viewing reaction for the Walking Dead Season 8 Mid-Seaon Finale, Episode 8, How it's Gotta Be!

Man, I hope you all enjoyed this half season.  This one went by in a flash, this was a pretty crazy end to one of the best first half seasons I think the series has ever had.  

Let me know what you guys think about it and how you feel about the decision to spoiler warning!!



Kill off carl.  Man Carl Grimes really is a character that I always regarded as safe in the series.  I'm not sure why they decided to go this route.  Did Chandler Riggs decide it was time for him to go out on top before the show gets too long in the tooth?  Maybe try to land some of those movie gigs or go to college?  Let's discuss in the comments below.

Love it or hate it, just remember one thing: At the Big Ragu, the sauce is the boss.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e3wPRa_0q38/sddefault.jpg,0.014523026259835956,0.0014526428233661171,9.997658079625293,0.0011566711005725526,0.015975669083202075,0.017132340183774627,2018-02-07,06:34:56,Wednesday,2,7,38,7,33,34,334,0,79,0,1,6,14,3,0,4.0,8.0,['Pra'],['Pra'],True,['pra'],1,1,3,0,0,0,0,6.149127518665893,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. “Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” upcoming “Dunkirk”).  

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).
Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Keith Baggs - Hey John, love the show. My question is... With the overwhelming success of Black Panther, do you think Marvel will make B.P. a bigger part of the picture/promotions for avengers 3, like DC did with Wonder Woman and the Justice League movie? Maybe even filming some more B.P. scenes to add to Avengers 3 or maybe even Avengers 4?

PATREON Supporter Brian Clark - The Greatest Showman made my top 10 list for 2017.  Although it has shown amazing box office legs, it did have a reported $84 million budget.  Is it fair to call the movie a “smash hit” at this point?

Josh Atkins - Josh A: Hey John, with the amazing success of black panther at the box office, and the success that infinity war is sure to have, what do you think will happen with Ant man and the wasp? Do you think it will be overshadowed? I am one of the biggest MCU fans, but I even find myself not caring too much about the ant man movie sometimes.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Giant Cinnamon Bun Cake I started with a dense roll cake recipe, then I dusted in cinnamon sugar, and rolled up with a sweet, light cinnamon spread.  This beast of a bun gets topped off with some dripping cream cheese frosting. The best part? It pulls apart just like a real bun!

On average, Britons eat 84kg a week per person per year, and global meat consumption is on track to rise 75 percent by 2050.

Industrial farming is also on the rise, but animal agriculture has a lot of downsides. It is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, habitat destruction and it is responsible for more CO2 being released into the atmosphere than all forms of transportation.

However, a potential solution is in the works as scientists around the world compete to be the first to create a lab-grown burger to market to the masses.

In 2013, Dr Mark Post and his team at the University of Maastricht made headline news when they proved it was possible to grow meat with a single cow muscle sample.

Growing meat in a lab is a revolutionary technique that boasts many pros, including eliminating the need to harm live animals, eradicating the dedication of large swaths of land to the cultivation of animals, and dramatically reducing methane emissions.

""Methane is actually a very powerful greenhouse gas,"" says Post. ""[Methane is] 20 times more powerful than CO2 and livestock and is accountable for 40 percent of all methane emissions. This process would reduce the number of animals from 1.5 billion to 30,000.""

Lab-grown meat is not without controversy, but could be a viable solution to satisfy the global appetite for meat and a growing world population.

In a ProPublica feature that collected the stories of over 1,400 former IBM employees, it was estimated that a staggering 20,000 American employees ages 40 and over have been eliminated by the company. How does one of the country’s largest tech giants quietly push out this many older workers? Don’t we have laws to protect people at the end of their careers?

LYRICS:
I need you
But you don’t want me,
Don’t want me, too

I need you
But you don’t want me,
Don’t want me, too

You left me in the worst way.
I’m scarred and my tears stain.
And when you know I’m hurting, 
You pull my heart out.
It was yours to break.

Now I’m running out of time to heal
the pain that you’ve been causing me.
And I know you’ve been in my mind, 
I can’t make you mine, can’t you see...

I need you,
But you don’t want me,
Don’t want me, too

I need you,
But you don’t want me,
Don’t want me, too

Got me in the fire I need you

Can we be together?
Is it gonna change? 
Or will you feel the same way forever?
You were the one, and now it’s done. 
You can’t understand what it was like
And I wonder why...

I need you,
But you don’t want me,
Don’t want me, too

I need you,
But you don’t want me,
Don’t want me, too

It's a weather cycle that's prompted a number of climate change deniers — including President Trump — to crack tired jokes about the concept of global warming.

But beyond the misguided social media jabs lies a serious and ongoing discussion about how scientists can connect individual extreme weather events to underlying climate change — and more importantly, how fast they can make now those connections.

Remember that study from 2004? It looked at a European heat wave that took place in 2003, and took a year and a half to complete. In contrast, just three months after Hurricane Harvey, scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published a study  showing that Harvey dropped 38 percent more rain than it would have without underlying climate change. Another group called World Weather Attribution found that hurricanes that size have become three times more probable

VICE News spoke with Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford and one of the researchers behind the first climate attribution study, who explained why scientists are now able to rapidly figure out if an event like Hurricane Harvey was more devastating than it otherwise would have been because of climate change. (Answer: it was.)

""We are now looking at accelerating that whole process because once you've agreed on the method you're using, you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you do a new study,"" Allen told VICE News. ""The actual time it takes to actually do the calculations is not that long.""

Then we started our holiday tour of the park by checking out the new retro inspired Christmas decorations around Echo Lake and we saw the tree lighting. Next we saw Sunset Season's Greetings, which is the projection show that is played on Tower of Terror, it was really cute and I definitely think you should make time to see this while you're in the park. Then we saw Jingle Bell, Jingle BAM! the returning holiday fireworks display show! That is one of the best holiday fireworks shows we've seen. It's a definite must watch!

Battlefield V Gameplay Overview:

Grand Operations is the ultimate multiplayer experience, designed to seamlessly showcase the maps and modes of Battlefield™ V. Each Grand Operation presents a powerful narrative experience inspired by historical events. Shortly after launch, you will be able to take part in the first Grand Operation. In the months that follow, you’ll continue the fight across other unseen and unplayed battlefields of World War 2.

Grand Operations is our upgraded version of Operations in Battlefield 1 – but now much greater than the sum of its parts. This modular experience takes players across fictional in-operation “days,” where each day is represented by a round played on a combination of a map and mode that brings the narrative to life. The actions you, your squad, and your team take on day one will have a direct impact on the narrative and gameplay start of day two, which in result will impact day three, and so on.

Play well on the first day and deploy with an adequate supply of ammo or vehicles when the map shifts, for example. Do poorly, and you’ll deploy the next day with perhaps fewer respawns, vehicles, or other resources.

Another important change is how each play session ensures all players get to play all featured locations – no more getting stopped by an overwhelming defense on that first point. Most Grand Operations in Battlefield V consist of three in-operation days – about an hour of total game time – but some may last longer if the score is close.

Scott is infamously dating Sofia Richie, and Kourtney has been cozying up to Younes Bendjima. But, apparently, Scott didn't know Kourt had found herself a new man. Cue his intense breakdown. Do you think he has a right to react the way he did, or is Scott trying to have it both ways?

SZA is definitely a force to be reckoned with and has proven herself to be one of the most talented people in the music game right now. She got 5 grammy nominations out the gate and totally killed her performance of “Broken Clocks.”
SZA kept the performance simple which allowed her incomparable voice to shine. The performance began with projections of shapes and symbols projected in front of and behind her while her back up singers supported her seated on the sides. For the fashun, she wore a dope fringe shirt with wide legged pants and sneakers which just screamed cool and made me want to live my best 90s life. 
At this point SZA’s career is on fire and it can only go up from here so I am very excited to see where that voice takes her in the future. What did you guys think of SZA’s performance at the Grammys?

Joshua Jackson makes his Broadway debut in Children of a Lesser God alongside Lauren Ridloff, telling the story of an unconventional teacher at a school for the deaf and remarkable woman he meets there. It received rave reviews (The New York Times called Jackson a revelation in his role) during last summer’s workshop in The Berkshires. Jackson’s additional stage credits include a successful run on London’s West End starring in A Life in the Theatre alongside Patrick Stewart.  The acclaimed comedy was written by the Pulitzer Prize and Olivier Award winning, and Oscar nominated David Mamet. He also starred in the off-Broadway play Smart People at New York’s Second Stage Theatre, about four Harvard intellectuals finding themselves entangled in a complex web of social politics.

Jackson currently stars alongside Dominic West, Ruth Wilson, and Maura Tierney in the Golden Globe award-winning television series The Affair on Showtime, which will return for its fourth season this June. Jackson was recently seen in the National Geographic Channel’s Emmy award winning documentary series Years of Living Dangerously. He previously starred on FOX’s hit show Fringe created by J.J. Abrams and made a cameo appearance in the Netflix Original Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

Well known as Dawson’s Creek’s fast-talking, self-deprecating Pacey Witter, Jackson has been working in front of the camera for over twenty years. His feature film debut was in Michael Bortman’s Crooked Hearts, which he followed up with The Mighty Ducks trilogy, Digger, and Andre the Seal. Jackson starred in Universal Pictures’ The Skulls, Rose Troche’s acclaimed drama The Safety of Objects, the HBO Films version of Moises Kaufman’s groundbreaking play The Laramie Project, and in Regent Films’ Aurora Borealis, opposite Donald Sutherland.

Jackson’s additional feature film credits include Sky, Cursed, Gossip, Bryan Singer’s Apt Pupil, and Cruel Intentions. He also starred opposite Rebecca Hall, Bruce Willis, and Catherine Zeta Jones in Lay the Favorite for director Stephen Frears and Inescapable opposite Marisa Tomei. He was seen as part of the ensemble cast of the critically acclaimed film Bobby for director Emilio Estevez and starred in the psychological thriller Shutter for 20th Century Fox/New Regency which was shot on location in Tokyo. Additionally, he had noted cameos in Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s 11, Scream 2, Urban Legend, and I Love Your Work.   In 2010, he received the Best Actor Genie Award for his starring role in the Canadian Independent feature film One Week.

이번 비디오는 제 남편과 친구 Das 와 함께 도쿄로 여행갔을 때 찍었던 get ready with me 인데요. 
사실 즐겁게 놀고만 오려고 했는데 아무것도 안 찍어오면 너무 아까울 것 같아서 찍었어요! 그래서 특별한 메이크업이나 제품은 없지만 제 데일리 메이크업이라 평소 하는 느낌대로 했답니다. 
즐겁게 봐주시길 바라요!! :)

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

유엔군사령부는 오늘(22일) 서울 용산구 국방부에서 공동경비구역 귀순 사건에 대한 특별조사단의 조사 결과를 발표했습니다.

유엔사령부는 ""귀순 당시 북한군이 군사분계선 너머로 총격을 가했다는 사실을 확인했다""고 밝혔습니다.

북한군은 당시 귀순 병사를 추격하다가 귀순 병사가 차를 버리고 남쪽으로 달리자 귀순 병사의 뒤를 쫓아 사격을 가했습니다.

오늘 공개된 CCTV 영상에는 귀순 병사가 북한에서 남한으로 넘어오는 긴박한 과정이 고스란히 담겼습니다.

영상은 북한 귀순 병사가 군용 지프차량을 타고 '72시간 다리'라고 불리는 북한 판문점 근처 다리를 건너 남쪽을 향해 달리는 장면으로 시작합니다.

귀순 병사는 다리를 건너 김일성의 이름이 새겨진 기념탑 쪽으로 차를 급히 몰았습니다.

김일성 기념탑은 판문점을 통해 북한 공동경비구역을 방문한 외부 인사들이 주변을 견학할 때 일정을 시작하는 지점으로 알려져 있습니다.

귀순 병사는 김일성 기념탑 앞에서 급히 차량을 오른쪽으로 돌려 세웠고 판문점에 도착한 차량이 배수로에 빠져 움직이지 못하자 차에서 내렸습니다.

근처 초소와 북측 판문각 계단에서 경계 근무를 서고 있던 북한군 여러 명이 귀순 병사의 차량을 발견한 뒤 놀라 뛰어오는 장면도 담겼습니다.

북한 병사들은 깜짝 놀란 듯 전력으로 귀순 병사의 차량을 향해 질주했고 귀순 병사가 차에서 내리자 일제히 사격을 가했습니다.

영상으로 볼 때 북한군 추격조가 귀순 병사를 향해 총을 쏜 거리는 불과 몇 미터도 되지 않은 것으로 보입니다.

귀순 병사는 총에 맞으면서도 남쪽을 향해 내달렸고 결국 남쪽 공동경비구역 벽 옆에 쓰러졌습니다.

유엔사령부는 열상탐지장비(TOD)에 잡힌 귀순 당시 영상도 공개했습니다.

영상에는 쓰러진 귀순 병사를 향해 낮은 자세로 엎드려 포복 이동하는 우리 군 공동경비구역 경비대대 대원들의 모습이 담겼습니다.

공동경비구역 경비대대 대원들은 귀순 병사를 발견한 뒤 4~5미터 가량을 포복 자세로 이동했습니다.

귀순 병사는 이후 안전한 곳으로 옮겨진 뒤 헬기로 이송돼 지금까지 치료를 받고 있는 상태입니다.

The culprit was the snow-on-the-mountain flower. What she didn't know is that it can be as poisonous as poison ivy.

He also described what it was like collaborating with Jerry Lorenzo and Fear of God on a collection. Now, for our docu-series, the vintage T-shirt dealer takes us through one of his typical days.

When Matamoros first moved to New York City, he set up on the corner of Prince and Mercer streets, in the epicenter of Manhattan's SoHo district. He recalls nearly giving up after spending a whole day there not selling a single tee until a man purchased multiple pieces right as he began packing up. Fast forward and he's meeting with Chris Gibbs of Union and taking us on a house call with music producer Benny Blanco in Los Angeles. Take a look above at what it's like to be a full-time vintage tee dealer for the stars where ""finding a shirt is like Fight Club"" and stay tuned for our next installment soon. In case you missed it, our last video had Blondey McCoy talking about the pressures of being a pro skater, fashion icon and balancing his love for art and music.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eI-ZZ-PpqS0/sddefault.jpg,0.01876544194125363,0.0007710359194225019,24.33796074676879,0.0010116847559296686,0.01953647786067613,0.020548162616605803,2018-01-16,18:59:16,Tuesday,1,11,12,11,12,67,109,2,23,0,0,9,12,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.889575290874723,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'traffic light': 3, 'person': 2}",5

Armour, helmets, shields, clothing, symbols and more.

Knightfall is an historical fiction drama television series. Knightfall was picked up for a 10-episode straight-to-series in January 2016, with Jeremy Renner as executive producer.
It recounts the fall, persecution, and burning at the stake of the Knights Templar, as orchestrated by Philip IV of France on October 13, 1307. The series focuses on Templar leader Sir Landry, a brave warrior discouraged by the Templars' failures in the Holy Land who is reinvigorated by news that the Holy Grail has resurfaced.

[Intro]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't, it isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure
Give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

[Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't, it isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 2]
Looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody that could...

[Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't, it isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Bridge]
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

[Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't, it isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Outro]
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood

It's PRIME TIME. AMAZON PRIME TIME. Amazon is well known for being a great service to obtain items in a quick and timely manner. With this new show not only do we put that to the test, but we venture into what Amazon is all about, the weird shit.

The rules are simple, using our collective funds we buy a few items  for each other and not knowing what they are, we share them with one another on the couch. We could very well go poor doing this, we just want you to know this.

The following is for those multicultural.

Where is she today

She who sways
She who spins

FAQs

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, and that is sophdoesnails, where I do loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! I do the occasional nail video on here but they are difficult to film.
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? I am 20
-What is your hair colour? 
Grey: Makki Hair colouring mask in Grey mixed with loads of conditioner.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST and on Thursdays at 5pm EST I do LIVE STREAMS!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make my Star Wars Porg Cake, I baked 21lbs of Ultimate Chocolate & Vanilla Cake, iced each layer with Italian Meringue buttercream, and decorated it all with Rice Krispie treats and SWEET fondant fur details. This cake is truly outta this WORLD!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

[ HONG JINYOUNG(홍진영)]

Teuroteu Fairy HONG JINYOUNG makes a grand comeback with her single album ‘GOOD BYE’. ‘GOOD BYE’ is a retro song pursuing revivalism of reminiscence, retrospect and memory, which has unprecedented vibes in her previous albums. Rather than anxiety of the speed from the modern civilization, this song gives a sense of familiarity and comfort with exciting melodies and addictive chorus.

Keratin (skin protein) and sebum (oil) combine to block the pore. They are often found on the face and trunk. but they can be found anywhere on the body.  Blackheads are not clogged with dirt, but it is the exposure to air that causes oxidation turning the internal contents black. They can be extracted using a comedone extractor.  I usually use an 11 blade (a blade that comes to a sharp point) and a Shaumberg type comedone extractor.

Dinah Jane and Ally Brooke from Fifth Harmony just took Lip Sync Battle to a whole new level. 

It looks like Maui and Jennifer Lopez joined Fifth Harmony and we are so here for it.

One of our favorite things to do is watch some of the biggest celebs take the stage on Lip Sync Battle. We probably watch Tom Holland’s performance of Rihanna’s Umbrella at least once a week, but we think we just found a new favorite.. and it’s not even out yet!
The Fifth Harmony girls battled it out and although their performance doesn’t air until February 1, we have a little snippet of Dinah Jane and Ally Brooke’s time on stage and we are OB-SESSED.

Dinah put her own spin on Maui’s hit song “You’re Welcome” from Moana and went all out. She wore a bodysuit to really get into the role and the backup dancers and scenery makes us dream of living on island far away. 

We thought that Dinah totally killed it, but then Ally took the stage and all we can say is WOW.
Ally did double duty and sang a few lyric from Selena Quintanilla’s   “Como la Flor” and  then transitioned into J-Lo’s “On the Floor”. 

We haven’t even seen their complete performances and we know that Lauren Jauregui and Normani Kordei are going to have to turn up the heat to be in competition with these two. 
In the video we can see the other girls reacting to what’s happening on stage and it looks like Lauren is going to portray Amy Winehouse and Normani is becoming a Barbie doll. 

We can’t wait to see the whole episode when it airs on February 1!
Are you living for these performances and who do you think will win the battle? Let us know in the comments below and then click here to see how former Fifth Harmony member Camila Cabello honored the DACA Dreamers at the Grammys. I’m Naz Perez, thanks for tuning in.

The moment the world learned that Prince Harry, who is fifth in line to the British throne, and Meghan Markle, one of the stars of Suits, were dating, the actress was met with a slew of support — and also criticism. After the pair announced their engagement in November 2017, Markle immediately faced more hate and negativity than ever before. Here are some famous folks who simply can't stand her...

Unfortunately there are not that vibrant anymore today. Coral reefs have suffered from the rise of water temperature, rise in acidity, destructive fishing methods and severe storms caused by climate change."" - Peter Schneider.  ""Rainbow Reef Relaxation"" is a 3-hour long, sweeping yet majestic & vibrant underwater journey to the world's most beautiful lagoons, as captured by Nature Relaxation collaborator Peter Schneider (Underwatercam) paired with ambient underwater sounds and brand new ambient music by the Cynic Project. Filmed in High Definition several years ago, thanks to its age this film offers magical glimpses of an underwater world that is bursting with life, color, and beauty. Unfortunately, reefs today in most of the world are suffering from severe bleaching and so with this film we hope to raise awareness by showcasing the divine beauty that only pristine underwater reefs can present, in hopes that it will motivate the viewer to take action and help save them before its too late! (https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/coral-bleaching-reefs-climate-change-el-nino-environment/) NO MUSIC VERSION @ https://youtu.be/wJIbhSYteK0 | 

More from Peter S:
""We all know that nowadays! This gives us the privilege and also duty to change and rethink our role in nature. What we also know today is that everything is connected and we are all a part of Nature, yes we are nature. So we don’t have to save the world, but recognize it as family. What we do to the world, the world will give it back to us. Equally the good and the bad things, that is law. The good news in it is, ...it is all up to you and me and everyone. You matter, I matter because we are all belonging to the same family. Now take a deep breath and join us for a dive beneath the waves.""

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. 

While her song ""Devil Devil"" hit success, it wasn't until her anthem ""Quiet"" made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. 

With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eSxb08eNaro/sddefault.jpg,0.014654908757263737,0.000280354776225915,52.27272727272727,0.0005861963502905495,0.014935263533489652,0.0155214598837802,2018-01-19,05:03:42,Friday,4,8,38,8,36,41,260,3,46,1,1,4,10,2,8,4.0,6.0,"['RIOT Ti', '', 'Ic', 'OAD INU', '', 'THIS,']","['RIOT', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'OAD', 'INU', 'THIS,']",True,"['riot', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'oad', 'inu', 'thi', ',']",7,7,18,1,0,2,0,6.2043957208298295,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Joseph Farella - I saw this morning that Christopher Plummer received a Golden Globe nomination for All the Money in the World after replacing Kevin Spacey a month ago. I never had much interest in the film but after the unprecedented replacement of Spacey and this nomination, I'm curious to see how good it can be. How many people will use this logic and boost it toward a better than expected/good box office earnings?

J.A. - Hey John! Love the shows! Just as excited for Star Wars! Now that you’ve seen Last Jedi, do you feel the box office prediction you’ve made earlier will still be the same or will it break records now that there’s a great deal of positive feedback coming out!

PATREON Supporter Dion Sheppard - Hey John! I'm glad you really enjoyed your time with SW TLJ! What do you think about Jeffery Dean Morgan's comments on the DCEU? He has expressed his excitement to play a role he has his eyes on; I think we all know what he meant by that. Do you think we'll see him as our Batman in the Flashpoint movie?

PATREON Supporter James Stanfield - Greetings and Salutations John. Do you think that with the Fox characters going back to Marvel there will be fewer comic book films coming out every year? Or will Disney and Marvel increase their production of 3 movies a year to 5 or 6?  I’ve been following you ever since you covered Man of Steel at AMC Movie Talk. I watch your videos every day and thank you for all that you do. Keep up the great work!

Magdalena Rosario - Do you think it’s possible one of the reasons Disney became interested in the Fox acquisition was because of the failure of Inhumans? From what I understand, Inhumans were sort of seen as the replacements for Mutants, but that was obviously a bust. What do you think?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eUefLQFusSQ/hqdefault.jpg,0.036489021586915735,0.0024836843078711647,14.691489361702127,0.01009327027241261,0.03897270589478692,0.049065976167199515,2017-12-13,19:40:17,Wednesday,2,17,24,16,24,91,186,1,49,0,0,16,19,3,0,4.0,7.0,"[': AAT', '', '| 3A antag', '', 'Se Pasian', 'Sd SEWN', '', '  ', '', 'an CAMPEASHOW']","[':', 'AAT', '|', '3A', 'antag', 'Se', 'Pasian', 'Sd', 'SEWN', 'an', 'CAMPEASHOW']",True,"[':', 'aat', '|', '3A', 'antag', 'Se', 'pasian', 'Sd', 'sewn', 'an', 'campeashow']",11,11,38,2,1,3,1,6.3600138382729625,4,"['neutral', 'scared', 'happy', 'angry']",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

Cardi B has had a pretty busy couple of weeks dropping singles, releasing her album this past Friday, and not confirming her pregnancy until she was ready to reveal. The pregnancy rumor started when TMZ revealed that one of Cardi’s reps said she didn’t want to be in a “party atmosphere” when she was invited to a VIP room after a performance during Super Bowl Weekend. At the time when an Instagram user asked her QUOTE “Is there maybe a Kylie Jenner secret that we need to know lol. Just asking.” With a pregnant emoji. Cardi replied directly saying, “no bitch I’m just getting fat. Let me fat in peace.” Of course this wasn’t the last time that outlets including us over here at Clevver reported that she was pregnant, but Cardi confirmed it for all her fans and haters this weekend. On the latest episode of SNL hosted by ‘Black Panther’ star Chadwick Boseman, Cardi B was the featured performer and although the outfit during her first performance didn’t reveal anything, when she took the stage for the second time to perform “Be Careful” in a custom Christian Siriano gown, we could see the beautiful baby bum in all its glory. Check it out. 

Cardi posted a couple of photos on IG including this screenshot that Rihanna posted. Cardi reposted this with the caption, “The love I’m receiving is overwhelming😩! I can’t thank you enough for always finding the time to share your support!! Thank you a million times @badgalriri” 

In another post, she took the time to shout out 50 Cent with a hilarious caption saying, You see @50cent is a nice person 😤He just be on his bully sometimes!! Thank you. 

She also took to Twitter writing, “I started winning when the whole world was doubting on me !think imma lose with my little baby counting on me ?” 

Her fiance Offset took to Twitter saying, “C A R D I A N D I L O O K F O R W A R D T O O U R N E X T C H A P T E R T O G E T H E R” with an adorable photo and posted the same photo on Instagram saying “T H A N K Y O U F O R A L L O F Y O U R S U P P O R T. W E F E E L S O B L E S S E D.”

Now even though Cardi B had every right to reveal her pregnancy on her time, many still wondered why she didn’t reveal sooner.  Well Cardi posted in a now deleted instastory exactly why she didn’t reveal saying QUOTE, “This is why i did not wanted to say nothing.People be so thirsty to scrutinize and try to destroy something that itsuppose to be a blessing.”

We feel you Cardi. When you’re a celebrity, people really do try to invade your privacy right?! 

No you are not Cardi! You are a beautiful mom-to-be with a banging album. If you haven’t already checked out “Invasion of Privacy”, do yourself a favor and give it a listen or two or three. But before you do that, let me know what you thought about Cardi’s big reveal? Were you shocked? Let me know in the comment section below. Thanks so much for joining me on News Feed, I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr. and I’ll see you next time!

Lyrics Luis Fonsi, Demi Lovato - Échame La Culpa

[Intro: Demi Lovato & Luis Fonsi]
Hey Fonsi?
Oh no
¿Qué pasa Demi?
Hey, yeah

[Verso: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato]
Tengo en esta historia algo que confesar
Ya entendí muy bien que fue lo que pasó
Y aunque duela tanto tengo que aceptar
Que tú no eres la mala, que el malo soy yo
No me conociste nunca de verdad
Ya se fue la magia que te enamoro
Y es que no quisiera estar en tu lugar
Porque tu error sólo fue conocerme

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato & with Luis Fonsi]
Okay, I don’t really, really wanna fight anymore
I don’t really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah
I don’t really, really wanna fight anymore
I don’t really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & (Demi Lovato) & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Dúo]
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato + Luis Fonsi]
Okay, I don’t really, really wanna fight anymore
I don’t really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah
I don’t really, really wanna fight anymore
I don’t really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & (Demi Lovato) & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Post-Coro: Dúo]

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eVWTVa31k-c/sddefault.jpg,0.009371450208254448,0.00018143380032815853,51.65217391304348,0.0008282847406285497,0.009552884008582608,0.010381168749211158,2018-03-01,09:35:00,Thursday,3,8,39,8,34,43,343,1,79,0,1,7,18,1,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.172912920604509,2,"['happy', 'scared']",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches.

What is the Russian Prison and Judicial System like? 
Support further explorations: https://www.patreon.com/theexploration 
This video explains the Russian justice system by examining the case of Boris Nemtsov, a political opponent of Vladimir Putin who was arrrested multiple times during protest. He was arrested for ""unauthrotized protest"" and ""disobeying police orders"". 

So what is life like inside the Russian prison system, and how does it work? Is there a proper justice system in Russia? Was Nemtsov be in one of the infamous prisons? 
In this mini Russian documentary, I’ll be exploring all these questions about Vladimit Putin’s government and exposing some of Russia's best kept secrets.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_Xg2IGTBmE/sddefault.jpg,0.019391063585099854,0.0006813206991026861,28.460992907801426,0.0009084275988035817,0.020072384284202542,0.020980811883006118,2018-01-10,06:29:00,Wednesday,2,8,38,8,33,41,334,1,79,0,1,7,14,4,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.291583375377387,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

George Lucas’ success as a director relies on his keen editor’s eye. As the steady hand guiding the Original Trilogy’s ship, he was able to make Star Wars into the most popular franchise of all time. Now the saga is in new hands, but we’ll never forget the many close calls that kept this space opera from being made. Whether it was budgetary concerns, unforeseen problems during production or lagging scenes, many obstacles almost kept these movies from being the successful blockbusters they became. Thankfully, clunkier lines and awkward exchanges were left on the cutting room floor. However, there are still some scenes that, if kept in, might have illuminated the characters waging that interstellar battle between good and evil.

In Episodes IV through VI, Luke gets the most screen-time, but  we’re robbed of character building when we miss his hangout at Tosche Station and the completion of his lightsaber. A last minute change of heart by Grand Moff Jerjerrod shows that some Imperials can have a conscience and Padme’s early plans of a Rebellion display that the Republic was more interesting than just an endless trade war debate. Han and Leia were both a bit busier in early edits of The Force Awakens, the Rebel forces were more active in Return of the Jedi, the Wampas were hungrier in Empire Strikes Back, and Force ghosts showed up as early in Star Wars chronology as Revenge of the Sith. Tune in and decide for yourselves whether these scenes would have added more depth to the galaxy far, far away….

Janelle Monae’s 'Make Me Feel' receives the EDX DUBAI SKYLINE REMIX Treatment!

Following one of his busiest, most successful Miami Music Weeks to date at the end of March, EDX now celebrates his fourth release in as many months, as he delivers another sublime remix for more pop royalty.

This time turning his expert hand to GRAMMY® nominated singer-songwriter/performer/producer/actress and activist, Janelle Monáe’s recent chart hit, Make Me Feel, the EDX Dubai Skyline Mix will be released on Friday, April 6 via Atlantic Records

Internationally renowned for his versatility in the studio, both with original mixes and commissioned edits, this latest cut sees Maurizio Colella back to his Dubai Skyline ways, as he follows up on his critically acclaimed remix work for the likes of Charlie Puth and Lika Morgan back in 2017. Brimming with playful energy amidst Janelle Monae’s infectious top line, expect to hear this dropped from continent to continent as the Swiss maestro continues to export his signature sounds to packed dance floors all across the globe.

After months of secrecy and uncertainty about just what Sony’s Venom might look and feel like on the big screen, the first trailer has finally dropped.

Unsurprisingly, the trailer’s light on plot details, but what it’s chock full of is a brooding, moody Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) reflecting on his life and the briefest of glimpses at the horrific transformation that turns him into the lethal protector. And by brief—we mean brief, as in there are a couple of split seconds where you can see the titular symbiote trapped within a container and later see its black essence spreading through Hardy’s body.

Mind you, this is only a teaser trailer, meaning that a proper trailer (hopefully featuring a fully-Venomized Brock) is likely to drop sooner than later. In the meantime, though, you should mull over whether you’ll be all that hyped when the movie drops on October 5.

""Venom"" is a 2018 movie made by Marvel Studios as a spinoff of the 2017 film Spider-Man: Homecoming. It is the first movie of MCU Phase 4. It serves as a prequel to Homecoming revealing Venom's origins. It adapts an episode from the 1994 Spider-Man animated series.

Tom Hardy, who was nominated for an Oscar for his work in The Revenant, is in final negotiations to star in Venom as Eddie Brock, while Ruben Fleischer, best known for directing Zombieland, is final negotiations to helm the movie project centering on one of Spider-Man’s signature villains. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. The project is one of Sony’s top priorities and the studio is not wasting time as the movie is set to open Oct. 5, 2018. Venom is to usher in a host of movies from Sony's Marvel and Spider-Man-based universe of characters (we could even see a Carnage movie, Tom Holland as the black symbiote Spider-Man or in the Iron Spider Suit we seen in Spider-Man Homecoming). 

Whether Marvel's vision will incorporate Sony's previously proposed spin-offs or try something new is unclear, but it's hard to deny that Spider-Man’s future with the studio is looking very bright indeed. Tom Holland in Spider-Man Homecoming was ""Spectacular"" and will hopefully make the studios secure future Spidey movies! We would love to see Marvel & Sony bring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back somehow as alternate Spider-Men in a huge Spider-Verse Movie crossover, perhaps even with Miles Morales (Donald Glover?) along side them.

http://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2017/12/11/the-walking-dead-midseason-finale-carl-chandler-riggs-spoilers

Dedicated The Walking Dead spoiler site The Spoiling Dead Fans regularly shares leaks and spoilers from the hit AMC series, but the site refused to spoil the events of the episode ahead of its December 10 airing.
""We have our reasons for doing this which we’ll share after the episode,"" the site wrote in a message to its members on December 7. ""We know this is disappointing for thousands of people that depend on us, and we fully expect some backlash. We're ready to take the heat.""
The day after Sunday's big reveal, the site delivered their full explanation: Carl actor Chandler Riggs politely asked The Spoiling Dead Fans to keep the episode's big revelation a secret.
“So I’ve come to realize that you all have probably figured out the big reveal at the end of 808,” Riggs wrote in a private message.

“I get that you guys have been doing this since we started, but I have a request. Out of respect for me, for Carl, and for one of the last few seasons of the show, I’m using you to not spoil the ending of 808 once your sources inform you of what happens.”
“I poured my heart into a couple of episodes this season, and 808 is one of them,” Riggs continued.
“I’m so proud of my performance and a lot of it rides off of a surprise ending. Of course this is what you all do, but the integrity of what happens is pretty crucial to my performance throughout the rest of the episode and I’d really appreciate it if you all would hold back just this one time.”
Riggs, who confirmed Carl’s death and his departure from the show, added, “This is the only time I’ll request something like this, so don’t worry about me coming back later and doing the same thing.”
The big reveal upset fans and Riggs' father, who blasted the show in light of Riggs' abrupt end with The Walking Dead after more than seven years.

""I'm very confident of a tenth season,"" Gimple assures THR when asked about the show's future and Lincoln's contract running out after Season 8. ""I think it is a question but there is some business to handle with the things you just said.""

When no one else seems to be getting through
Only you can tell what's going on

When I hear you name
Put a smile up on my face
It don't matter the time or the place
You make it all better now
I could love you forever now
When I hear the sound
When I'm feeling down
Ain't nobody else gotta be around
For you to make it better now
Let me get myself together now

Let me sing my song
Don't wanna be alone
I know that when I listen
I find what I've been missing
Right here in my heart
Let me sing my song
I know this is my home
All that I've been wishing
I found what I've been missing
You were right here from the start
So let me sing my song

Everything that you've told me
I thank you every day for
All the things you wanted me to be
Is every thing I've prayed for
When the weight of the world is on my shoulders
You would take the away the pain (take away the pain)
Through the storm the sun still shines
With you by my side I'm not afraid

When I hear you name
Put a smile up on my face
It don't matter the time or the place
You make it all better now
I could love you forever now
When I hear the sound
When I'm feeling down
Ain't nobody else gotta be around
For you to make it better now
Let me get myself together now

Let me sing my song
Don't wanna be alone
I know that when I listen
I find what I've been missing
Right here in my heart
Let me sing my song
I know this is my home
All that I've been wishing
Found what I've been missing
You were right here from the start
So let me sing my song

All my doubts and fears
All my cries and tears
They all just disapear
When ever you, were near
You are still right here
You are still, oh right here
Right here
Right here
Right here
Still right here
Right here
Right here, right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, here
Right here, here, here, here
Right here

Watch the Q&A here: https://youtu.be/JuVc_pIwVYE

What is the future of the world’s biggest physics experiment? And what intriguing hints of new physics are around the corner?

Harry Cliff is the Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science, which he reckons might be the only job title which begins and ends with 'science'. He spends half his time searching for signs of new physics at LHCb, one of the four big experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. For the other half, he indulges his love of talking about physics at the Science Museum, where he develop exhibitions, events and online content.

This talk was filmed in the Royal Institution on 31 October 2017.

1) New look at Incredibles 2 debuted at the Olympics

2) 'Captain Marvel,' 'Chaos Walking' Writers Tackle Silver Sable/Black Cat Movie

3) Tessa Thompson to Star as Doris Payne in Jewelry Heist Movie

4) ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’: Jon Favreau to Voice an “Important Alien Character”

5) Uncle Drew Teaser Trailer Released

7) Live Twitter Questions

Disney/Pixar released a new trailer and extended look for The Incredibles 2 last night during NBC's coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics from Pyeongchang, South Korea. In the much anticipated sequel, Helen, a.k.a. Elastigirl, is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob navigates the day-to-day heroics of ""normal"" life at home with Violet, Dash and baby Jack-Jack - whose superpowers are about to be discovered. It hits theaters on June 15, 2018

According to THR, Lindsey Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, are penning the most recent draft of Spider-Man spin-off Silver & Black; based on the characters from the Spidey-verse: Silver Sable and Black Cat.

Variety reports that Tessa Thompson has signed on to portray Doris Payne, in a movie about the true story about a woman who gained notoriety for jewelry heists in stores around the world. The film is conceived as a high-concept action-drama in the vein of Catch Me if You Can and  The Thomas Crown Affair.

Ron Howard responded to a tweet yesterday revealing to the world that a famous actor/director is a part of Solo: A Star Wars Story. Turns out Lion King helmer (and Happy Hogan actor) Jon Favreau is voicing an alien in the movie

Lionsgate released the new teaser trailer for their upcoming comedy sports movie, Uncle Drew starring NBA superstar, Kyrie Irving. The project originally started as a five-year digital series, and has now been turned into a feature-length film.

Deadline reports that CBS Films has finally set its lead female cast for Hellfest, the Gregory Plotkin-directed movie produced by The Walking Dead’s Gale Anne Hurd. The movie tells the story of a masked serial killer who “turns a horror-themed amusement part into his own personal Halloween slaughterhouse.”

FAQs:
Q. How old are you?
I'm 18.

Q. Where do you live?
 I’ve lived in the Philippines my whole life, but I speak English very well because many Filipinos speak English and Filipino fluently.

Q. What camera do you use?
 I use a Canon 80D for my main videos and I use a GOPRO 5 Session and a Canon s120 for my vlogs.

Q. What do you use to edit your videos?
 I use Premiere Pro

Q. Every when do you upload?
 I try to upload every other week. But because of the uncertainty of school work and such (because I’m an IB Diploma Candidate) I am unable to produce many videos when I have class.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efaVvT_pjzQ/sddefault.jpg,0.029067124198386605,0.0006122761365375785,47.47388059701493,0.0109524320841834,0.02967940033492418,0.04063183241910758,2018-04-29,13:03:57,Sunday,6,13,41,13,27,82,356,4,46,1,0,8,0,1,0,5.0,8.0,"['Glossier.', 'REVIEW']","['Glossier.', 'REVIEW']",True,"['glossier', '.', 'review']",3,3,15,1,0,0,0,6.0692205006296565,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Back in the '80s, the World Wrestling Federation - now known as World Wrestling Entertainment - was a grab-tastic slam-stravaganza crammed with classic characters and legendary storylines - and Andre the Giant was the Atlas holding it all up. The 500-plus-pound Andre dwarfed even the most enormous of his fellow athletes. According to Sports Illustrated, one of his hands could engulf a 12-ounce beer can, and his wrists were thicker than most men's ankles. The Giant dominated wrestling for decades, but he also battled perpetually gained body mass and debilitating health problems. Meanwhile, the strain of fame destroyed him mentally. Here's the tragic real-life story of Andre the Giant...

Todos con La Roja en el Mundial! #FuriaRoja #VamosEspaña

LETRA:

¿Quien dijo que no podían?
Qué no daban para más
La historia nunca ha estado escrita
Y hoy somos la envidia del fútbol mundial

El éxito llego tarde
Yo nunca dejé de soñar
Sentí que con aquel equipo
De bajitos magos podíamos ganar.

117 Iniesta chuta y GOL!
Siempre supimos que eramos muy grandes,
Pero la suerte la espalda nos dio.
El tiki taka nos trajo la gloria, Luis Aragonés... Pulsó!

La tecla para hacernos invencibles,
Luego Del Bosque lo perfeccionó,
Fue insuperable lo que conseguimos,
3 grandes seguidos y aún queremos más.

Woah oh oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja y vamos a ganar!
Woah oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja y vamos a ganar!
Woah oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja.

No somos tan diferentes,
No hay muros que derribar,
No caben ideologías,
Trae cerveza fría
Que esto va a empezar.

117 Iniesta chuta y GOL!
Siempre supimos que eramos muy grandes,
Pero la suerte la espalda nos dio.
El tiki taka nos trajo la gloria, Luis Aragonés... Pulsó!

La tecla para hacernos invencibles,
Luego Del Bosque lo perfeccionó,
Fue insuperable lo que conseguimos,
3 grandes seguidos y aún queremos más.

Woah oh oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja y vamos a ganar!
Woah oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja y vamos a ganar!
Woah oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja.

Iremos a Rusia para conquistarla
Lo daremos todo por ganar el mundial
Iremos a Rusia para conquistarla
Lo daremos todo por ganar el mundial
Y no será fácil pero lucharemos
Moriremos por ganar!

Chuta y gol!
Siempre supimos que eramos muy grandes,
Pero la suerte la espalda nos dio.
El tiki taka nos trajo la gloria, Luis Aragonés... Pulsó!

La tecla para hacernos invencibles,
Luego Del Bosque lo perfeccionó,
Fue insuperable lo que conseguimos,
3 grandes seguidos y aún queremos más.

Woah oh oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja y vamos a ganar!
Woah oh
Saquemos nuestra furia roja y vamos a ganar!

Our local host Arshdeep (Miss Canada Globe winner 2019) brings Riley (of Techlinked) to try authentic Indian street food (chaat, or snack food, to be precise - including papri chaat and dahl), and then gets free food (really!) at a gurdwara - it's a charitable tradition of Sikhism called langar to offer free food at each Sikh temple. All this Indian food comes from Surrey, BC, a suburb of Vancouver, Canada with a large Indo-Canadian population. If you're looking for a Vancouver food recommendation, and you've never tried real Indian food before, check out Apna Chaat and the nearby Sikh Gurdwara!

Riley Murdock (Techlinked/Linus Tech Tips/NCIX Tech Tips) is a Youtuber who makes tech videos.

Arshdeep Purba, a Punjabi-Canadian actress, model, and dancer, was the winner of Miss Canada Globe 2019.

Surrey is home to one of the largest Punjabi communities in the world outside of South Asia, so it's a perfect place to find legit Indian food and experience Punjabi culture.

First season of Secret Informant brings you to Vancouver, Canada, a vibrant multicultural city with lots of great food from around the world! Follow our curious host Riley to explore and experience the authentic cultural food there is. Let our secret informant - Arsh, show and explain to you what makes an Indian restaurant traditionally authentic.

While I appreciate the gesture I would rather hold onto my Switch for now just in case a breakthrough is eventually made. Thanks to NYKO for reaching out.*

So after a year of beating up my Switch, it finally gave out on me after the 5.0.0 update and using a third party dock. While it's tough to tell how connected the update and bricking is, others are starting to have similar issues online since the update with similar cases popping up online. Nintendo needs to come up with a solution for save data back ups, it's been a year and at this point it's time to fix a leering problem.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elqSK4SFoc8/sddefault.jpg,0.0257687245107136,0.0002762013680599012,93.296875,0.0009537578490818462,0.02604492587877349,0.02699868372785534,2018-05-04,21:03:42,Friday,4,10,40,10,35,54,332,3,79,1,1,8,10,2,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.726985793016295,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Meaning the original people groups of Europe that inhabited the landmass before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans, a group which would later evolve into the vast majority of European nations we see today, from the Russians, Italians, Irish, Norwegians and Greeks.

Although precious little is known, there are clues left behind in the archaeology, genetics, linguistics and historical texts that have been passed down through the generations, which gives us a somewhat fuzzy picture of pre-historic Europe. Be sure to let me know your thoughts on the pre-Indo-European Europeans and let me know which culture you think is the most interesting. Thanks for watching!

It is smack in the middle of finals now, isn't it! This vlog of April, specifically 11 days I filmed out of the entire month. It was a lot of hectic catching up (and recovering from vacation mode).. didn't help that I got sick, for like the 6th time this school year!

For us students, we are either just bracing ourselves for finals, or pushing through (or both). I tell myself to end each of my days trying to take away one thing I've learned that day, and find some positivity out of it. I also remind myself that there is so much ahead for me in life, and when I get very overwhelmed about school work- I know that in a couple decades time, this would have just been another part of growing up. So I make the most of it, really take in all the highs and lows, and mostly importantly, put my best effort into what I do.

Also I won't shame myself into feeling like a failure when things go wrong. It's the first week of finals and let me tell you, things are just going awry left and right.

I had this whole schedule planned out, color coded and fancy telling me everything I have to do for my 4 courses to stay on track. And right off the bat, my yarn runs out for weaving and I was delayed 2 days to prepping my loom. Last night I was washing my silkscreen, and the water RIPPED a hole in it. This happens, I have to say I wasn't as careful as I should have been, but it's frustrating because it cost me another $50 to buy a new screen and tape to stretch it...

Whenever I make these errors though, I just keep in mind that this is how I learn... I tell myself, ""I will never make this mistake again"". It's no guarantee, because you know accidents happen, and it's frustrating, but I tell myself that so I can be as preventative as possible.

But anyway- For those who are out for the summer, hooray! I hope you are having a great start to your break, I would love to hear what you are up to in the comments below. I have so much coming at me this summer, it is both exciting and a little scary! Can't wait to share that with you through the summer vlogs.

I also had this idea of making daily vlogs? Most of my footage is compiled in a weekly (or in this case, monthly) format. Would daily be too short, or too boring since there aren't as many scenes in it? I have been watching daily vlogs lately, and I haven been enjoying it. Let me know!

Also, thank you to everyone for writing translated captions for the last couple of videos recently. Here is the link to contribute:

Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the biggest cinematic spectacles of the year. In addition to returning characters like Luke, Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren, the eighth film in the Skywalker saga will add several new faces, like Kelly Marie Tran, who's been referred to as the ""biggest new part"" of The Last Jedi. In the film, she portrays Rose, a member of the Resistance who works side-by-side with Finn. Kelly Marie Tran might not be a household name yet, but it won't be long before her face is gracing thousands of action figures and posters. Nonetheless, she might look awfully familiar to Star Wars fans, and with good reason. Here are just a few of the places you may have seen her before…

I have found a paper on 'safety holes'... very interesting.

One could argue that chicks that are not strong enough to get out of the egg by themselves should not survive. I have a different opinion.
To me all life is precious. So if I can save a chick by helping it, I will.

The 'safety holes' are used when incubating rear and endangered bird species. It increases the chances of survival in the fiercely process of hatching.
Yet one has to be extremely careful. It happens easily that a chick get's injured.
This video is about the hatching of my emu eggs, the second largest eggs in the world. (and the most beautiful ones :)
The first Emu chick got out all by himself. The second one needed a little help.

Text in this video:

Seven weeks earlier:
For seven long weeks, I had no idea
If these eggs would contain life
They needed to loose 10% of their weight
So I checked them
Every egg every week
With a smaller egg it’s easy to check for life
This time that was impossible
Because the shell was way too thick to shine through
I didn’t see anything
Finally after seven weeks I could try the ‘water trick’
My hope was that at least one of the eggs was alive
And now, now I could finally find out
So, fingers crossed
Will they move?
Hmmm…
The first 4 eggs I tried, didn’t move at all
Nr 5
Oh yeahhh
And nr 6 as well!
Why always the last ones?
Some day’s later the most heartwarming thing happened
Did you see that?
The next day the reaction to my whistle became stronger
The next morning
Yes! First crack
I was very exited 
Yet it took another day before it went further
Two days after the first crack, I thought now we were almost there
But it still went slow
And the other egg (nr 6) started to worry me
It was still reacting to me, yet lesser and weaker
The chick seemed to be too weak to crack the shell
Weaker chicks might die at this point
There isn’t much you can do
But I study eggs :)
And I had found a most interesting paper
A study on ‘safety holes’
The idea is simple: by very carefully making a little hole…
Inside the ‘air chamber’, the chick can breathe oxygen and gain strength 
First I had to be sure on which side to drill, so I listened
Now I needed to work very carefully
I started at a natural spot
“Yes, yes, I know…”
The shell was a lot harder than I had thought it would be
It took surprisingly much effort
There is still a whole net of tiny blood vessels surrounding the chick
Loosing a drop of blood from one of them is not a problem
As long as I don’t shoot-out
Good… Now it can breathe
Almost immediately it sounded better, stronger
I used my phone to record its sound
When I returned at the incubator, the first chick was already out of its egg
So I put it in an old incubator to dry
The ‘safety hole’ proved to be very effective
So a short while later…
This one went a bot quicker now, but it still took some hours
Here are the highlights
In nature it would be under a giant bird right now 
Over here it needs a little help to get rid of the last parts
So now I have two baby emus at home
Might need to look for a bigger house soon

More stories soon     cool if you subscribe

The incubator I used is a MS incubator

I love reading and responding to your comments and as you can tell I'll jump into the comments section with a reply or a heart.

A couple favorite questions in this video are

1) How to get rid of eye bag or How to get rid of dark circles

2) Is Alkaline Water healthy

3) Should I dye my hair blonde

4) When to change underwear

5) High school classes to take in becoming a doctor

6) Staying in NYC

7) Are Coffee enemas legit + Other Health and Wellness topics

Doctors are traditionally unreachable and I want to change that. So hop into this video’s and any other of my video’s comment section and let’s chat! I want to see your username pop up on my next responding to comments video.

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series soon so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

From filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.

“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).

Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/erIaSavA-A0/sddefault.jpg,0.002289138603942758,5.439537276695662e-05,42.083333333333336,0.00026177773144097873,0.0023435339767097145,0.002605311708150693,2018-01-26,17:30:14,Friday,4,5,59,5,56,26,483,1,107,3,0,1,0,0,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.36012881042937,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

-Batgirl, Flashpoint Rumored to Be Part of DC’s Next Wave of Films
-Danny Boyle Frontrunner to Direct Bond 25
-IT Chapter Two Casting Begins: Jessica Chastain in Talks for Adult Beverly Marsh
-Opening This Week
-Robert Rodriguez, ‘Kong: Skull Island’ Writer Team for Sci-Fi Thriller ‘Hypnotic’
-Tomb Raider’ Clip Shows Lara Croft Has the Worst Luck
-Disney’s Live-Action ‘Pinocchio’ Enlists ‘Paddington’ Director
-Live Twitter Questions

Mentioned briefly in an article at The Hollywood Reporter, it looks as though the next slate of films inside the DCEU is taking shape.  As THR announced the hiring of Warners exec Chantal Nong, the trade also mentioned that after Aquaman debuts in 2018, and with Shazam! currently in production, THR’s insiders say that the next wave of films for the DCEU will likely include the Flash film (Flashpoint) and Batgirl.

According to Variety, casting on the IT sequel has officially begun and Jessica Chastain is in negotiations to star as the adult version of Beverly. Variety also confirms that director Andy Muschietti is set to return, with Gary Dauberman penning the script. And indeed, Bill Skarsgard is set to return as Pennywise.

OPENING THIS WEEK

AGREE / DISAGREE

THR reports that Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island writer Max Borenstein has come on board to re-write Robert Rodriguez’s original screenplay entitled Hypnotic. Rodriguez is attached to direct and produce the project, with details being kept secret about the story.

Warner Bros. has released the first clip from their upcoming Tomb Raider. The new movie (which is also a reboot of the Angelina Jolie films before) follows a young Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) as she travels to a hidden island in search of answers behind her father’s disappearance.

According to Variety, Disney is now in talks with Paddington director Paul King to helm its live-action Pinocchio retelling. Ever since Paddington 2 became the most-critically acclaimed pic of all time (according to Rotten Tomatoes) King has been on the industry’s radar.

Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle turned out far better than anyone had any right to expect. What initially sounded soulless and cynical ended up being a massively successful, well-received, family-friendly thrill ride for kids and adults alike. Starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, the movie effectively built on the 1995 story about a magical board game with a video-game-based, body-swap comedy sequel. Welcome to the Jungle made a lot out of a wacky premise, but that doesn't mean it was perfect. Many of its quirks won't be picked up by younger viewers, but the adults in the room probably noticed them. Here are some of the things only grown-ups will notice in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle...

A surprising approval for Donald Trump's hard line on North Korea from the South.

President Moon Jae-in said Wednesday (January 10) Trump's ""fire and fury"" threats for Kim Jong Un might have done its job.

(SOUNDBITE) (Korean) SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT, MOON JAE-IN, SAYING:

""I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing the inter-Korean talks.""

The two Koreas held talks on Tuesday (January 9) for the first time in more than two years, where the North agreed to hold military talks with the South and send a large delegation to the Winter Olympics next month.

Washington raised concerns the talks were a ploy to drive a wedge between itself and Seoul, but on Wednesday (January 10) Moon said his government takes the same view as the U.S. on how to respond to the North's threats and warned Pyongyang could face even tougher sanctions if provocations continue.

The North, for its part, made it clear in talks:

its weapons program isn't up for discussion, but any South Korean worried about missiles can relax.

(SOUNDBITE) (Korean) CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OF THE FATHERLAND, RI SON GWON, SAYING:

""Regarding the nuclear issues, our strategic weapons including the atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, and intercontinental ballistic missiles are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren.""

Still, Washington welcomed Tuesday's (January 9) talks as a first step towards solving the nuclear crisis and the U.S. State Department said it would even be interested in joining future talks.

There may be opportunity for that.

More talks are slated for the two Koreas before the Pyeongchang Olympics next month.

Following an extensive casting process conducted across five different continents which auditioned nearly 1,000 different actors, Disney has selected Chinese actress Liu Yifei, also known as Crystal Liu. Yifei made her name as an actor back in the mid-2000s, with roles in Chinese fantasy/adventure TV series like ""The Return of the Condor Heroes"" and ""Chinese Paladin,"" but American audiences most likely know her from her supporting role as the Golden Sparrow in 2008's ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" which starred Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Fulfilling the official requirements for the role, Yifei has both “credible” martial arts skills and the ability to speak English, and will head up the cast for director Niki Caro and Disney’s live-action ""Mulan"" retelling. The project is based on a draft written by Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa, of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" and will draw inspiration from the animated 1998 adaptation of the ancient Chinese legend, which tells of a young woman – named Hua Mulan – who secretly replaced her father in the national army in fifth-century China.

Normally, an upside-down fish in your tank is bad news. As in, it’s time for a new goldfish.

That’s because most fish have an internal air sac called a “swim bladder” that allows them to control their buoyancy and orientation. They fill the bladder with air when they want to rise, and deflate it when they want to sink. Fish without swim bladders, like sharks, have to swim constantly to keep from dropping to the bottom.

If an aquarium fish is listing to one side or flops over on its back, it often means it has swim bladder disease, a potentially life-threatening condition usually brought on parasites, overfeeding, or high nitrate levels in the water.

But for a few remarkable fish, being upside-down means everything is great.

In fact, seven species of catfish native to Central Africa live most of their lives upended. These topsy-turvy swimmers are anatomically identical to their right-side up cousins, despite having such an unusual orientation.

People’s fascination with the odd alignment of these fish goes back centuries. Studies of these quizzical fish have found a number of reasons why swimming upside down makes a lot of sense.

In an upside-down position, fish produce a lot less wave drag. That means upside-down catfish do a better job feeding on insect larvae at the waterline than their right-side up counterparts, who have to return to deeper water to rest.

There’s something else at the surface that’s even more important to a fish’s survival than food: oxygen. The gas essential to life readily dissolves from the air into the water, where it becomes concentrated in a thin layer at the waterline — right where the upside-down catfish’s mouth and gills are perfectly positioned to get it.

Scientists estimate that upside-down catfishes have been working out their survival strategy for as long at 35 million years. Besides their breathing and feeding behavior, the blotched upside-down catfish from the Congo Basin has also evolved a dark patch on its underside to make it harder to see against dark water.

That coloration is remarkable because it’s the opposite of most sea creatures, which tend to be darker on top and lighter on the bottom, a common adaptation called “countershading” that offsets the effects of sunlight.

The blotched upside-down catfish’s “reverse” countershading has earned it the scientific name negriventris, which means black-bellied.

--- How many kinds of fish swim upside down?

A total of seven species in Africa swim that way. Upside-down swimming may have evolved independent in a few of the species – and at least one more time in a catfish from Asia.

--- How do fish stay upright?

They have an air-filled swim bladder on the inside that that they can fill or deflate to maintain balance or to move up or down in the water column.

--- What are the benefits of swimming upside down?

Upside down, a fish swims more efficiently at the waterline, where there’s more oxygen and better access to some prey.

evMb8o7imBM,Epm5_DSfMn4,Jim Ross Predicts Who Will Take Over WWE After Vince McMahon,Business Insider,17.0,2018-01-25 15:32:16+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'WWE', 'Vince McMahon', 'Stephanie McMahon', 'Royal Rumble', 'WrestleMania', 'Jim Ross', 'Triple H', 'Paul Levesque', 'Shane McMahon', 'Wrestling', 'Professional Wrestling', 'Pro Wrestling', 'Disney']",189321.0,2234.0,99.0,840.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/evMb8o7imBM/default.jpg,"For decades, WWE has ruled supreme as the world's number-one ""sports entertainment"" company.

In 1982, Vince McMahon bought the company that would eventually become WWE from his father, and he's run the empire ever since. Today he is the Chairman and CEO, and he also occasionally appears on television as his ""Mr. McMahon"" character. 

Now 72, McMahon still oversees every aspect of the company, but some have begun to speculate regarding who might take over his role, assuming he ever decides to step down. We asked WWE Hall of Famer Jim Ross, a part-time WWE employee whose relationship with the company spans decades, what he sees as the most likely outcome.

Ross is currently promoting the release of his new book ""Slobberknocker: My Life in Wrestling,"" which he wrote with Paul O'Brien. Following is a transcript of the video.

Jim Ross: I have an opinion on where the company will go. I will say this — you know, Vince is very healthy. He still works out like a crazy man. He really takes care of himself. So, he ain't going anywhere soon. We don't want him to go anywhere soon. He's the rock that built that thing. He's the rudder in the water. It's an amazing company.

[Jim Ross is a legendary WWE announcer and executive. He wrote a new memoir about his career in wrestling]

I think that, if I'm guessing, and it's gonna strictly be a guess — that the money would be on, probably, Paul Levesque to be Vince's successor.

[Paul Levesque is better known as ""Triple H."" He's one of the most popular WWE superstars in history. And he's married to Vince's daughter Stephanie McMahon.]

I think Vince is kind of preparing him for that in a lot of ways. You always knew that he was different from the other guys because he was very studious, and very – under control. He didn’t drink. No drugs. He looked to be a lifer early on, and he got a lot of that from being a fan all his life growing up in the northeast — New Hampshire. Then, getting trained by Killer Kowalski who was a great, old-school guy. So, I think he's probably the heir apparent.

[Levesque is WWE's EVP of Talent, Live Events, and Creative. He also runs WWE's developmental promotion known as NXT]

Stephanie is very involved and, you know, is really more of a face of WWE. She does a lot of charity work.  And she's great at that. And you've got to have that in that world.

[Stephanie's older brother Shane also works for WWE]

I think Shane seems to be, apparently, content with being a TV character. I don't know where his role's gonna be going forward or what he wants it to be. But, I think that Paul Levesque is the one that seems to be earmarked to be the next guy, if and when Vince is not in that role. 

But Vince is a — he's a unique cat, man. For him to get a publicly traded company in wrestling — are you kidding? Think of the image that wrestling has had for so many years. And I will tell you that if Vince had not rehabilitated the image of sports entertainment and made it a global brand, there's just no way in hell I'd even be sitting here talking to you. I wouldn't even —I would be unknown!

He made all of us known and he created a Walt Disney empire with bodyslams and headlocks and the actors playing the role of their own stuntmen. It's been an amazing metamorphosis, how that's evolved. And I don't believe that there's ever been a more brilliant entrepreneur than Vince McMahon in any walk of life. Think about it. Smokey old arenas — the image that wrestling had. ""Oh, that rasslin' stuff’s all fake! Aw, nobody watch rasslin’.”

All of a sudden, he's in over a hundred countries and 40 languages or something and it’s big-time. And I just think that what he's done, without me kissing his behind – I've done that, too, on television. In the world that he was managing and pulling out of, he had to be tough. You know, he's a brilliant man.

FURTHER READING

“Diplomacy is an art that evolved initially to deal with problems in the relationships between countries. The leaders of neighbouring states might be touchy on points of personal pride and quickly roused to anger; if they met head on, they might be liable to infuriate each other and start a disastrous war. Instead, they learnt to send emissaries, people who could state things in less inflammatory ways, who wouldn’t take the issues so personally, who could be more patient and emollient. Diplomacy was a way of avoiding the dangers that come from decisions taken in the heat of the moment. In their own palaces, two kings might be thumping the table and calling their rivals by abusive names; but in the quiet negotiating halls, the diplomat would say: ‘my master is slightly disconcerted…’…”

In fact, this may be the only publicly available visual media for Shot Yuma, as I haven’t even been able to locate a photo of the test.

Careful observers may note that the clapperboard in this footage reads May 28, whereas Yuma officially took place on May 27. The discrepancy is accounted for by the Marshall Islands being across the International Date Line from the United States. 

Yuma, a tower shot, was fired at 19:56, 27 May 1956 GMT, which was 07:56, 28 May 1956 local time at Eniwetok Atoll, Aomon Island. 

Shot Yuma utilized the smallest US test device publicly known, at 5” diameter, 24.5” long, and weighing under 100 pounds - arguably close to “suitcase nuke” size. The UCRL linear implosion device, known as Swift, was designed to be fusion boosted however the device failed to boost in this test, thus resulting in the relatively low yield of 190 tons.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ewmHE7nmu48/sddefault.jpg,0.0016350352877869073,1.0348324606246247e-05,158.0,0.0003001014135811412,0.0016453836123931536,0.0019454850259742948,2018-01-03,17:11:09,Wednesday,2,11,13,11,11,74,103,3,16,0,0,10,0,1,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.295987326931807,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

At 2:03 everyone keeps saying ""Ob-wan Kenobi"" Here is the link to what they are talking about lol

Petra is amazing. She's been seen on TV all over the world. She's potty trained. We hold her over the trash can and say ""Go potty"" she does then we tell her ""Good girl"" We've had her since she was a few weeks old. We finished hand feeding her. She's a pro with her Alexa, and is currently training on her Google Home. She responds to her training by correcting us with ""ALEXA"" when we say ""OK GOOGLE"" lol. These are just a few clips of what makes Petra so amazing. it ends with a ""I love you bye bye"" she says that any time someone leaves the room lol

UPDATE: Petra FINALLY said ""Google"" & it only took unplugging her Alexa to get her to do it! 5-10-2018

CBS interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKOL7ywDli4&list=PLlCAEQFz0T_yVtb9fqNnnkStd0RFHRooh

The Petra Time line. We keep being asked so we sat down and put it together, between time stamped photos, calendars and receipts lol
June 16th, 2014 Petra hatched
July 27th, 2014. We got her & finished hand feeding her
August 26th, 2014. Her first 2 words in one day. ""Hello"" and then ""Peanut"" the words weren't clear, but they were definitely said.
August 28th, 2014 we realized just how smart she is. I told her ""NO BITING!"" and held her beak. She said in here baby babble voice ""Good birdie""
She understood that biting was bad and she needed to be a good bird. And was probably hoping to get out of trouble by trying to convince me she was a good birdie lol. We were so shocked!
December 16th, 2014 we filmed Petra saying numerous things as a still dark eyed youth.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

When the idea of Ant-Man being introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe was first brought up, a lot of fans - particularly those unfamiliar with the comics - were underwhelmed.

In a universe of gods, aliens and enormous green rage monsters, what use could a guy who can make himself really small be?

Well, as it turns out, he's very useful - and he could go on to become one of the most important characters in the franchise.

So, in this video, as we look forward to Ant-Man and the Wasp later this year, we'll take you through ten reasons why that's the case.

The reasons in question are; he might have been on an extremely important secret mission during the events of Avengers: Infinity War, his ability to enter the Quantum Realm could prove decisive in defeating Thanos going forward in the MCU, he's an original Avenger in the comic books and a true comic book icon, thanks to time-travel he could actually become an ""original"" Avenger in the MCU, his existence in the MCU has brought the Wasp to the forefront of the superhero world, Michael Douglas' Hank Pym was Ant-Man previously in the franchise and may have saved the world before, his humour is a very important trait when it comes to keeping morale up, he brings a sense of family to proceedings, he's a skilled thief and that could prove very useful for the MCU's heroes, and he's actually far more powerful than people give him credit for (he's far from simply being ""a guy who can shrink"").

We hope you enjoy the video. Let us know your thoughts by leaving a comment - and please don't forget to subscribe to Screen Rant's YouTube channel so you never miss our great new video uploads in the future.

When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakanadan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war.

#BlackPanther is the new action movie by Ryan Coogler, starring Chadwick Boseman, Andy Serkis and Michael B. Jordan. The script was written by Joe Robert Cole.

-I enjoy grindy games, and I know not everyone does
-I loved Destiny 1, and this is mainly a comparison to Destiny 2
-I do own Destiny 2 and have completed all the content including the raid and trials
-I have months played on Destiny 1 and have nearly everything in the game, so this is not coming from someone who has little to no actual experience with Destiny
-This is my opinion, and you're free to comment yours. The reason it sounds so biased (and is) is because I was just fed up and disappointed with how Destiny 2 turned out

The new Star Wars game, Battlefront 2, is about The Empire’s Plan B after the Death Star is destroyed. Apparently, this plan involves a weapon that can control the weather on entire planets. But is something like this even possible, and if so, how would it work? Well, it turns out that weather modification and weaponization are Real areas of scientific study! The Empire knows it’s science, and in this episode I’ll reveal how they’ll use it to build the scariest Weather Weapon of all time.

Only die hard fans of Harry Potter caught these small details the first time around! For this list, we’re looking at some of the most surprising bits of foreshadowing that even the biggest “Harry Potter” fans may not have caught onto. We can’t say for sure whether every single one of these was intentionally written in by J. K. Rowling, but considering her masterful storytelling skills, we’d be surprised if they were simply coincidences.

Choosing a name for your new baby can be overwhelming, but sometimes it’s like people didn’t even try. This includes celebrities such as Uma Thurman and Kate Hudson, who saddled their kids with some truly unfortunate monikers. In the most liked Instagram post of all time, we found out that Kylie Jenner has named her new baby Stormi. Meanwhile, an adult Stormi, went on to name her child Gravity. Mike Myers and his wife named their two children Spike and Sunday, and we aren’t sure what they were thinking! Uma Thurman couldn’t pick just one name, so she calls her child Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence. We get that Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon like the letter “M” but were Moroccan and Monroe really the best they could do? There are also a staggering number of celebrities that decided to name their child “Bear,” maybe hoping their infants would sleep as soundly as one.

Katie doesn't want to have sex with Josh, because she is in a happy relationship and also, like, no way! But if somebody could have sex with Josh, that would be pretty cool.

Since signing with Atlantic, Sheeran has sold millions of records, had a song appear in the second installment of The Hobbit and won a Grammy for Song of the Year, ""Thinking Out Loud.""

Yes—These are camels snacking on cactus. This pair of dromedary camels, Baby and Nessie, clearly don’t mind the spines. It hurts, but they can handle it. Camels have adapted to harsh desert conditions that require them to eat thorny plants. Inside a camel’s mouth, small cone-shaped protrusions called papillae guide the animal’s chew. The key is to avoiding being poked by the spines. Camels pivot their chew and slide the needles vertically down their throats. Regardless of their discomfort, the ruminators keep ruminating.

This was against the Jedi code and infringed on his Jedi philosophy of 'no attachments'. However, the council knew it, Obi-Wan Kenobi knew it, Mace Windu knew it, and of course Yoda as well. So why did they let it all unfold? 
The answer is from the novels and the film itself, so let me know what your thoughts are on this. Should the Jedi Council have let Anakin proceed? What if the Jedi Council DIDN'T Ignore Anakin's Feelings for Padme? Would Palpatine have taken him a his Sith apprentice early?
Would Snoke have contacted them earlier? Would Order 66 still happen? 

Thanks for watching everyone and as always, may the force be with you!!!

JUNGLE vs. FIRE ANTS! OMG! Fire ants are on a whole different level! They are a force to reckon with in the ecosystems they belong to, are super aggressive and sting, and can even float on water! They are the true kings (or queens rather) of the jungle! Join me as I recreate the fire ant motherland, the Amazon rain forest, in a massive South American biotope paludarium, complete with flowing river and both native Amazonian plants and creatures, in order to provide a new and fitting home for our ravenous and aggressive Fire Nation (red tropical fire ants). Watch how we put this incredible half terrarium-half aquarium habitat together! How will our fire ants deal with the move into this new home? Hope you enjoy this week's episode and debut of the Selva de Fuego!

*Correction: I discovered after creating this video that the Assassin Snail (Clea helena) is actually native to Southeast Asia, not South America, so I will be swapping it out with a Channeled Apple Snail (Pomacea canaliculata), which is native to South America.

Am Freitag erhellte es den Nachthimmel über der US-Metropole Los Angeles und zog eine spektakuläre Rauchwolke hinter sich her. Spekulationen im Internet über ein außerirdisches Flugobjekt wurden zum Leidwesen aller Ufo-Enthusiasten rasch enttäuscht: Es handelte sich um einen Start einer ""Falcon 9""-Rakete der privaten Raumfahrtfirma SpaceX.

Die Rakete war vom Luftwaffenstützpunkt Vandenberg in Kalifornien gestartet und auch in benachbarten Bundesstaaten wie Arizona sichtbar. SpaceX-Gründer Elon Musk nahm den Hype um das angeblich unidentifizierte Flugobjekt mit Humor und postete ein Video der Rakete auf Twitter. Es handele sich um ein ""Nuclear alien UFO"" aus Nordkorea, scherzte er. (dpa)

Dinesh is uniquely qualified to speak on this—he grew up in a country ruled by gangs with little to no hope of social advancement and came to America in pursuit of the American Dream, something that no other country can lay claim to.

Young America’s Foundation engages with students across the country to inspire them with the ideas of individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional values. YAF is the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement and introduces hundreds of thousands of young Americans to these principles every year, most of whom have never heard the arguments for freedom and personal responsibility before.

● Description
Matthew has kindly donated this C64 to the cave, the first we've looked at, so I called upon the support of Jan Beta to help us to identify what type of C64 we have.  I take you through the chips on the board, and we learn a little about the origins of the machine.

The passenger has no control which makes it terrifying and when they move around the bike wobbles in al sorts of directions which end up making the driver crash haha!

Il lui écrit ses plus grands succès et transforme l'idole Yéyé en star branchée. En 1976, le tube qu'ils interprètent en duo ""Ça balance pas mal à Paris"" permet de lancer la carrière de chanteur de monsieur. A deux, ils deviennent les rois de la chanson française. En 1978, elle est évidemment l’une des stars de sa comédie musicale « Starmania ». A la mort de son mari en 1992, la chanteuse décide de mettre fin à sa carrière et ne sort plus d'album studio. France Gall ne refera jamais sa vie et restera toujours fidèle à Michel Berger dont elle gère l'héritage musical. En 2015, elle lance ""Résiste"", une comédie musicale reprenant les tubes de son alter ego.

“Riverdale” has been one of the most  popular binge-watch worthy teen shows on Netflix. And there’s a good reason behind its popularity! But did you know that “Riverdale” was actually inspired by the characters from Archie Comics? And those characters have been around for decades before “Riverdale” even became a show! That’s right, Archie Andrews, Veronica Lodge, Betty Cooper, Jughead Jones, Josie and her band, and plenty of other characters have been around for longer than you know. And not only that, they are actually pretty different in the comics. Some of them have a completely different story while others just look like a brand new character! This is how the cast of “Riverdale” should have looked if they were copied from Archie Comics!

Wait until you see which unexpected character had the biggest change! Don’t forget to subscribe to TheThings for more videos like this one and hit that like button if you love “Riverdale”!

We got back from the Olympics on February 26th. We did laundry at home for a half day and then flew to NYC for a week of media and interviews. This is Part 1 of our NYC trip…

And for those of you who have asked, we DID vlog during the Olympics, but we’ve been so busy that we haven’t had time to take a look at the footage and put it together. Don’t worry, it’s coming soon! In the meantime, we will be posting videos from our trips to NY and LA. We are still in LA and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon! Stay tuned for more videos on a more consistent basis (WE HOPE)!

Thanks for all the support! Let us know what types of videos you want to see from us! Also, we want to collab with different channels and creators. Who would you like to see us do a video with?

fB1vM1tCz7Y,rEzEGto67Jw,An Investigative Reporter Explains Why The Trump-Russia Dossier Is Not 'Fake News',Business Insider,25.0,2017-12-08 19:28:54+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'Donald Trump', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Dossier', 'Politics', 'Spy']",8790.0,139.0,163.0,126.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fB1vM1tCz7Y/default.jpg,"Luke Harding, journalist and author of ""Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win,"" explains why he believes the Trump-Russia dossier is not ‘fake news’. Following is a transcript of the video.

The 'Steele dossier' was authored by former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele. The controversial report claims that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia. Trump has called the report ""fake news.""

Luke Harding: Well I mean, saying the dossier is fake news doesn't make it fake news. It's just an assertion.

My name is Luke Harding. I'm a journalist and a writer. And my new book is called ""Collusion"" and it's about Donald Trump and Russia.

According to people I've talked to, who are kind of close to ""Steele"", believe that the dossier is not flawless. One or two things may be wrong. He acknowledges that there's raw intelligence but broadly he thinks it's right. And he says it's between 70-90% correct. That's his kind of assessment. Which for an intelligence report is pretty good.

As we learn more about the Trump team and engagements with Russia, we were told to begin with, ""nothing to see here."" I think the dossier kind of is standing up pretty well.

The thing about intelligence is it's kind of not black and white. It's sort of grey. Some sources are better than others. But my understanding is that even though Steele hasn't revealed who his sources are we don't know who they are. They're sources that have kind of proven themselves in other areas.

For example, Steele read a whole lot of reports about the war in Ukraine in 2014, using these same sources that were behind the Trump dossier. And they were well received by US intelligence, who were actually sent up to John Kerry in the State Department and they were accurate.

Steele was hired by research intelligence agency Fusion GPS to investigate Trump.

Critics of the dossier say Fusion GPS is a ""gun-for-fire"" agency for opposition research.

Luke Harding: There's been a lot of kind of noise about Fusion GPS but really that's all sort of process. At the end of the day it doesn't matter who paid for the dossier. We know first of all it was a rich Republican who didn't like Trump. Then the Democrats took over the contract.

But essentially the key question is, is it true? Is it true?

And we now have a special prosecutor, Bob Mueller who's examining all of this. We have Trump firing the head of the FBI, James Comey because of ""the Russia thing."" Which was kind of vexing him, and we have a kind of– we have a sort of process going forward to try and verify all of this and I think really that's all that Steele wanted.

Steele wanted his allegations to be taken seriously and he wanted the US with its kind of vast resources and investigative powers to examine it.

""A Million Dreams Lyrics by The Greatest Showman""                            

I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazyThey can say, they can say I have lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we are gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we have lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we are gonna make

However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you are bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we are gonna make

For the world we are gonna make

There is a clear and consistent pattern of treating the Clinton investigation differently than other investigations. At least some of this ‘special’ treatment seems to have been motivated by political bias. As America’s premier law enforcement agency, the FBI must rise above the fray of partisanship. Our judicial system depends on equal treatment under the law.

I finally did it. I sold all of my bitcoin. I took massive gains and am a happy camper. Know that gains are not realized until you sell. Hence that is what I did. There could be more profits to be made but the rapid ramp up of the price has me worried. I feel the risks are very elevated. I certainly will not buy more at this price of near $15,000 and so that meant I was selling slowly. With various market sentiments I can gather from various sources, I finally sold the remainder of my holdings due to my increased conviction that there will be a gradual reduction in price or a correction coming. Of course, it's all speculation and I might be wrong. I know I'm happy with the gains so far.

With all eyes on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming nuptials, it's pretty easy to forget about all the things that will take place after the big day. Marrying into British royalty is a bit different than becoming a Disney princess. By that we mean there are rules. Here are some things that Markle will be barred from doing after she says ""I do"" at St. George's Chapel in the spring of 2018...

[HuhGak(허각)]
 
HuhGak releases a new song ‘The Last Night’ in approximately three months after ‘Only You’ that deeply moved people’s heart in November 2017. This track ‘The Last Night’ that will follow ‘Only You’, which is still high on the chart, has the delicate lyrics describing the last of two people who are about to break up and the lyrical melodies. It was completed by the understated sad voice of HuhGak.

**UPDATE. THE SUPERCHAT QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT GET ANSWERED ON THE SHOW WERE ANSWERED IN A FOLLOW UP VIDEO THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE: https://youtu.be/wUItvcRoyAA

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter John Paul - This past weekend there were 50th anniversary screenings of the classic movie ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and earlier this year there were 25th anniversary screenings of ""The Princess Bride"". My question is what movie released this year will we be looking back on as a classic? With so many great movies this year, which ones do you predict will stand the test of time?

B.J. Hipp - Hi John. I was wondering, you remember the movie Drive? I seem to remember that there were plans for The driver (Ryan Gosling) to be in more movies. What happened to that idea?

Paul McElligott - I’ve seen YouTube videos quoting a story from AICN, claiming sources say that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine in Avengers 4. When you read the story, however, it only cites three unrelated facts. Disney is buying Fox movie assets, Avengers 4 is filming, and Jackman said that he would only return to Wolverine in an Avengers movie. No new statements from anyone involved, and the internet runs with this as if it’s “news.”

Bruce Gordon - Just Watched the trailer for Ready Player One. So many reasons to want to see this film but what tugged at my heart were those few music notes at the end which brought back memories of what I love about movies. I know I’ve been suckered in by great marketing but I don’t care.

Rick Kear - Hey John love the show. Just wondering is it to soon for warner Bros to announce the new upcoming dc movies after justice league bombed they just confirmed some this week at comic con.

Shooting the video for “One Strange Rock” was such an insane experience. The National Geographic team had projected videos onto the cave walls that made me feel like I was in another world. I also want to shout out my buddy Brian Tyler for helping me with the orchestration on this song. 

About One Strange Rock
From award-winning filmmaker Darren Aronofsky comes a mind-bending, thrilling journey that explores the fragility and wonder of planet Earth—one of the most peculiar, unique places in the universe. Hosted by Will Smith, and told through the eyes of experienced astronauts, comes an extraordinary story of why life as we know it exists on Earth.

I had requests to add a few more songs to my video. I have a plan for a future video that I will show later in the future. In the meantime I hope you all enjoy a more complete version of my video. Thanks :) everyone please share, like and subscribe if you would like to see more of Grace

I deleted the other video because it was pretty much the same thing except that this one is more complete and is what I would want people to see. Hope you understand.

The Aviary was a big project for us...but we're excited to let some fresh new Galantis music out into the world

‎ 'Spaceship' takes us to the core of Galantis and our love for dance music. We couldn't be more excited to join forces with Uffie. The first time we heard 'Pop The Glock', it blew our minds... and since then, Uffie's music has always stuck with us. See you on the dance floor!

Microsoft’s new Surface Book 2 laptop/tablet is a great looking hybrid device with the perfect hardware for power hungry consumer. The surface book 2 can be purchased with an i7 Intel Core processor,  GTX 1050 or GTX 1060, 267 PPI PixelSense Display, 17 hour battery life and up to 16GB of RAM. The flexibility of the laptop and tablet mode can come in handy for many situations and can be the perfect solution for students looking for a lightweight, strong 2 in 1. The lack of a thunderbolt 3 port does limit it's ability to connect to external GPU's and multiple 4k displays.

Happy tuesday (or wednesday) to you! I have been having a great time, wrapping up the rest of this winter session in school. In fact, my final day was just today and I finally got to finish editing to put this up afterwards!

In this vlog, I track some of my process while making my books, as I begin to try out digital art! I start with hand drawn illustrations with ink, and later convert it digitally. The next vlog will be more in depth, as well as probably a completely dedicated video for the project!

I will be going to disneyworld for the weekend, so if any of you are there, make sure to say hello if you see me! Absolutely love meeting and talking with you. I will attempt to finish up the next couple videos so that I could at least schedule one for upload while I am away on the trip.

Regarding the evacuation in the theater- no worries, it wasn't anything dangerous. The theater staff told us afterwards that there is a glitch in their alarm system, so their fire alarm would actually go off daily (very annoying) and until fixing it, they have no choice but follow procedures each time. I didn't get to finish the movie, but at least they reimbursed us with a ticket for us to use when we return anytime.

Thank you so much for watching, and a quick reminder that we can still vote daily for us in the shorty awards, until the 22nd of this month!

Our voting link- http://shortyawards.com/10th/pyperbleu

Thank you for all the supportive messages and heart felt words I receive from you. Especially about prayers for me and my family. We are all just holding on, and it makes it so special that we can make the best out of things together. My grandfather is living comfortably now that he is in hospice service, and that brings me a bit of peace.

I hope you can make this coming week a great one for you, no matter what difficulties try to bring you down. Look for love and bring it to others.

Best Wishes,
Annabelle

In the final of the 2018 Valspar Championship, Tiger Woods showed signs of the past with his incredible birdie putt on the 17th hole, but finished in a tie for second in the final round.

The Valspar Championship is held at the Copperhead Course at Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor, Florida. In 2017, Adam Hadwin outlasted Patrick Cantlay in a thrilling duel that was tied going up the par-4 18th hole and resulted in Hadwin's first TOUR victory.
