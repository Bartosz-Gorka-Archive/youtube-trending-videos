Primatenforscher Davis Okoye (Johnson) hat Probleme im Umgang mit seinen Mitmenschen – dagegen verbindet ihn eine unerschütterliche Freundschaft mit George, dem außergewöhnlich intelligenten Silberrücken-Gorilla, den er von Geburt an aufgezogen hat. Doch als ein illegales Genexperiment aus dem Ruder läuft, mutiert dieser sanftmütige Affe zu einem rasenden Monster von gewaltigen Ausmaßen. Damit nicht genug – bald stellt sich heraus, dass auch weitere Tiere auf diese Art manipuliert worden sind. Während diese neu geschaffenen Alpha-Raubtiere Nordamerika unsicher machen und alles vernichten, was sich ihnen in den Weg stellt, tut sich Okoye mit einer in Ungnade gefallenen Gentechnikerin zusammen, um ein Gegenmittel zu entwickeln, wobei er auf einem sich ständig wandelnden Schlachtfeld einen schweren Stand hat. Denn es geht nicht nur darum, eine weltweite Katastrophe zu verhindern, sondern auch das fürchterliche Biest zu retten, das einst sein Freund war.

There is only one way to find out, and thats with an unboxing from JerryRigEverything. STAR WARS SPEAKER PRICING HERE: http://amzn.to/2ofQ0Ie

The science behind levitation is pretty interesting. Magnets themselves wont be able to free float on top of one another, But when electromagnets are introduced with automatic variance controls, levitation is possible. Basically Star Wars level technology going on right here inside this speaker. #YeahScience.

Would you buy one of these Star Wars speakers? Do you want one of these Star Wars speakers as a gift? Let me know in the comments.

And so it begins, our 7th annual Advent Calendar the seasonal online celebration of womanhood presided over by Editor in Chief Katie Grand.

“Peace on earth and goodwill towards all men,” she recently read. “Well, towards all women, anyway.” ‘That seemed to just about sum up this year,’ she says. ‘It’s festive, it’s fun and it’s everything we love about women enjoying being women, on their own terms.’
The cast-list for 2017 is full to the brim with an array of stellar talent: of beauty, brains, brawn and a touch of tinsel. ‘It’s a collaboration,’ she adds, ‘everyone talked about what they wanted to do, a consensus is agreed and then we handle making the magic happen.’

This year Love Advent will take us all the way through to mid January. ‘When you have a jolly idea, it seems a shame to end it during what can be the least jolly week of the year,’ says Grand.  

To kick us off on Friday 1st December, here is a taster of what’s in store this Advent

While it has some awesome unique features, it lacks many things you’ll find on the Xbox One or PS4. Even so, the Nintendo Switch has a number of hidden features you probably don’t know about.

This is TheGamers list of Nintendo Switch Tips and Tricks You Probably Didn’t Know. 

Whats the most useful Nintendo Switch tip you know?

Did you know you can use a USB keyboard to input text on Switch? Or that Nintendo has tucked a full-fledged internet browser onto the system, just out of sight? And those Joy-Con controllers are much more versatile than they seem at first. Not only can you use them to play Switch games, but you can even connect them to your phone or computer to play games. If you’ve ever binged through a game only to wonder how much time you actually poured into it, the Switch lets you check your play time in any game you’ve played. Not only that, but the Switch can also turn on your TV.

And don’t think you’re locked into games released in your region. You can set up a new eShop account to buy and play games from any region. If you’re in the mood for a new game but don’t want to spend a lot of money, you can see which games are on sale at any time in the eShop. If you frequently find yourself running through your battery’s charge, you might want to get yourself an external battery pack to squeeze out more playtime. If you’re the only one who plays your Switch, you can make it stop asking which user you are each time you start up a new game. And finally, if you manage to lose track of a Joy-Con, the Switch can help you find it.

Not a bad set of features for such a tiny game console.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vTWNY56GzTA/sddefault.jpg,0.015205347860987197,0.0006118984643322411,24.849462365591396,0.0006513757846117405,0.015817246325319438,0.016468622109931174,2018-01-19,06:23:15,Friday,4,9,38,9,33,55,334,2,79,0,1,7,14,4,0,5.0,8.0,"['JOHN KELLY NICKNAME BETTING POOL', '', 'nae 00s BEIS', 'Jel Bet Key 2', '', 'John “The Joe as Toe!

''In 2015, four years after singer Amy Winehouse's death, Universal Music U.K. CEO David Joseph announced that he'd destroyed all of her demo recordings in an attempt to prevent anyone from releasing them posthumously. Despite that, composer Gil Cang, who wrote songs for Winehouse early in her career, has posted a Winehouse track called ""My Own Way"" to YouTube.

Cang, who co-wrote the scratch track with James McMillan, announced on the YouTube post that the song is one ""we love and want the world to be able to hear."" He says he recently rediscovered the recording, made when Winehouse was in her late teens, and decided to share it.

In an interview with the Camden New Journal, a newspaper outside of London, Cang says he and McMillan ""had been writing quite a lot of pop tunes, doing a lot of pop promos with various artists who would come in, many of various, dubious talent. It was at a particularly dire time in the pop world — lots of terrible, terrible girl bands and boy bands and we had to make something for them. Amy came in to see us, opened her mouth and just blew us all away.""

In 2011, Island Records, a division of Universal, released a compilation album of Amy Winehouse B-sides and demos selected by producer Mark Ronson called Lioness: Hidden Treasures. A second compilation was released in 2015 as the soundtrack for Amy, a documentary about the singer's ultimately tragic life''.

I do not own any of this material. It belongs to its owners.

Let's support Amy Winehouse and her precious legacy

Lyrcs:

I've never been in love before 
Such a foolish thing to be 
Seems to me the price is high 
So I'll keep my own company 
And I'll do what I want 
When I feel

Watch them fall so easily
Temporary insanity
Some say that true love is blind
Me I like to clarify
While I 
I just take 
My own time
And I 

I'll go my own way 
I walk when I wanna 
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna talk talk 
When I wanna

Seems to be illogical
Love that's unconditional
Give your heart to someone else
But save a little for your self
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/amy-winehouse/-/my-own-way.html]
That's why I'm 
I'm taking my own time
And I 

I'll go my own way
I walk when I wanna 
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna

Don't get me wrong 
It's kinda cynical
But it scares though
So I'm careful with my heart
It's the only one I got
I cannot 
commit to that shit

Ill talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
I'll go my own way
And I'll walk when I wanna and tell u
When I wanna
My own way my own way
When I wanna when I wanna

All you need is liquid latex, cosmetic paints/shadows/whatever's safe for your face, and if you wanna go full tide pod... sfx gelatin that's dyed blue and orange by mixing in some water activated colors.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

""(CNN) The Nunes memo is finally public.

So what does the eponymous memo, named for House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, actually prove about the FBI, the Justice Department and the roles senior officials in both of those organizations played in the 2016 election?
By my reading, precious little.

The memo's biggest claim is that then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the House Intelligence Committee that no FISA warrant would have been issued relating to one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page without the so-called Steele dossier -- the work of a former British spy named Christopher Steele that was being secretly funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. The House Intelligence Committee was not made aware of the financing behind the Steele dossier during its investigation.

That could be a big deal. Except, we don't know for sure that the timeline of events -- and the reporting on who said what when -- in the Nunes memo correlates with the objective truth. Why? Because the actual FISA court warrants are classified. And because Democratic sources familiar with the Intelligence Committee testimony suggested Friday that McCabe did not, in fact, say that the FISA warrant would have never been issued if not for the Steele dossier. The sources also said McCabe did disclose to the committee that the Steele dossier was paid for by Clinton and the DNC.

If you are inclined to believe -- as President Donald Trump is -- that there is a widespread deep state conspiracy within the Justice Department actively working against you, then you see all sorts of wrongdoing here.”

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

Lars Andersen tries to perform these tricks.

Of course this is not historical archery, but Mahabharata is clearly written by people with great knowledge about archery and knowledge about real historical archery heroes.

Something described may in one way originate in real events that are exaggerated a lot.

I has been trying for several years if these described tricks can be performed in reality

Shoot multiple arrows at the same time:
(also described in other writings)
Whether it's historical reality can be discussed, it can be done but has a lot of problems
If 3 arrows are shot at the same time, it takes a long time to make the arrows clear, they do not have much power and not high accuracy.
3 arrows shot quickly after each other, can be done faster far more precisely and with very high power.
Perhaps it's extreme fast shooting that is seen as shooting simultaneous arrows?

Hit a rotating fish in the eye by looking at a reflection:

I tried and it was surprisingly easier than expected
The arrow could certainly have hit more in the middle of the eye, but since the purpose was only to show it could be done so it was not done again.


Hit different things in the air are often described in mahabharata
sword arrows wagon wheel etc.

Please do not try this,ever!!!!!
I had been training hard for years before I even started thinking about this, so do not try yourself.


Hit a machete so it stops:
It could be done but is so unpleasant that I never do it again.

Hit an arrow in the air:
When I first read about this he thought it was impossible, and never anything that was done in history.
But now I has done so many times the last year, so it may be considered whether there may also have been a few Indian historical super archers who have learned the same.
But even if some have, it still very doubtful whether it has been practically applicable as anything but choice for performance trick archery.

The painting 0:55 is from the exciting MAHABHARATA project http://mbharata.com

Many ask about equipment:
I always build my arrows myself, not modern standard arrows
but different reproductions of historical arrows.
The bows used in this video Végh bow 53 # 28 ""
Grózer 49 # 28 "" and some homemade bows.

Criticism is good
But i remove hateful not funny comments.
I also remove negative and incorrect comments from people who think themselves to be archery experts, but do not know history, physical laws etc..

Lars Andersen",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vZSYh-qIAOk/sddefault.jpg,0.04073069175519888,0.0006587305782147129,61.832095096582464,0.00330148326941787,0.0413894223334136,0.04469090560283146,2017-11-17,11:39:20,Friday,4,4,7,4,7,27,68,1,13,0,0,4,5,0,0,6.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.522002289287072,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'skateboard': 1, 'person': 1}",2

⭐⭐DESCRIPTION⭐⭐

Fortnite Battle Royal was made by Epic Games. Much like Player Unknown BattleGrounds, it's a battle royal style game where multiple players fight to be the last one standing. Although PUBG was the original game to have this style of gameplay, Fortnite seems to have a more fleshed out (and goofy) feel to it with things like the fortnite building mechanics, tons of wacky items such as bushes, axes, and boogie bombs that make you dance. We hope you enjoy our Fortnite vs PUBG skit

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v_Ou0aWNs68/sddefault.jpg,0.01316940643138584,0.0001641740456721603,80.21612903225807,0.0005131762911494299,0.013333580477058002,0.013846756768207432,2018-04-02,00:37:03,Monday,0,17,52,16,50,93,484,1,121,1,3,12,0,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.350480426578987,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Hi Teacher Friends! In this video, I share with you what a typical day in the life of a second grade teacher is like! Keep in mind that we are now at the end of the school year, so things may be a little different than what a typical day might be like earlier in the school year. :) Enjoy!

In April 2018 — less than a month before they were set to walk down to the aisle — professional wrestlers John Cena and Nikki Bella announced that their relationship was over. What happened? A little and a lot, according to the rumor mill. From conflicting schedules to angry outbursts, there was a lot going on behind the sordid curtains of the Johnikki engagement. Here's the real reason Nikki Bella and John Cena broke up...

It’s tone and intended audience changed, sometimes radically, between movies and especially between the original series and the remake. Here, I’m looking at how and why.

Robocop, broadly, is about a policeman who gets gunned down by villains and rebuilt as a cyborg by an amoral corporation. OCP are, really, the driving antagonists of all four films, utilising Robocop as the PR pre-game to taking valuable defence and security contracts that will make their corporation king.

All four outings feature Alex Murphy, aka Robocop, dealing with life being not quite the man he once was, but also an incredible force of justice, and the thematic backbone of the series is the juxtaposition of man and machine together. Murphy is limited by directives and by direct control, but Robocop, you might argue, is limited by Murphy.

Based off this: https://teslamotorsclub.com/blog/2017/08/15/the-model-3-needed-new-ap-hardware-but-not-for-the-reason-everyone-thinks

The last Model 3 event was the least climactic Tesla event because the #TeslaModel 3 event was The Anti-Sell. Tesla does not want you to buy a Model 3 yet.

Tesla doesn’t want you to think Model 3 is its best car just because it’s their newest model, even though it has some newer technology compared to the Model S which is 2x the cost. Tesla doesn’t want to sell more Model 3’s right now. With 450,000+ preorders, Tesla has a backlog. They’d much rather sell a more expensive Model S or X because they can produce those immediately & make a profit.

Model 3 has new Autopilot Hardware 2.5 & provides more power for future autonomous driving, including added computing & wiring redundancy. Starting July 2017 all Tesla cars have HW 2.5 and Tesla said any previous cars with HW2 that somehow may not be capable of full self driving would get a free upgrade if the customer paid for FSD. Tesla still believes HW 2 is capable of self driving.

Why introduce HW 2.5? The Tesla Network is Tesla’s future ride sharing platform. It’s like Uber & Lyft but instead of a human the car will drive itself, pick up passengers, and take them to their destinations.

From Tesla Master Plan:
""When self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination. You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app & have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation.”

Model 3 is currently the only Tesla vehicle that is capable of joining the autonomous ride sharing network. The minimalist interior is a polarizing feature of Model 3. Almost everything in Model 3 is controlled by the 15” touch screen, from opening the glove box to climate control, it’s all software-based controls.

Why? Because autonomous ride sharing. Since it's software controlled, everything is customizable and can be remembered based on who is using the car. Model 3 answers two concerns regarding autonomous ride-sharing: What if someone steals my valuables, and what if someone damages my car? The first is addressed with software-controls. You can restrict or grant access to anything.

What about damage to your car? Model 3 has something in it that the S or X don’t currently have: an interior camera. It can see who is in the car at any given time and monitor what’s happening inside the car. But with a new camera how will the car handle the new data processing? The new Hardware 2.5

Model 3 doesn’t come with a car key or even a key fob. It comes with an NFC key card to unlock and start the car. But this is the backup method. The real entry method is a smartphone. With the Tesla app & Bluetooth LE, it sends an encrypted signal to Model 3 as your get near it so when you have your smartphone in your pocket and walk up to Model 3 it will unlock. It knows exactly who is getting in the car and it will set the car settings based on who the person is.

Model 3 has new autopilot hardware, a new interior camera, is software controlled, and has automatic entry via a smartphone. Tesla Model 3 is not just another electric car built for the mass market. It’s not even about a car capable of driving itself. Model 3 is the first car ever to be designed for autonomous ride sharing.

#Tesla is downplaying the significance of #Model3 for now, but there’s no denying that it may be the most technologically advanced car ever.

From Elon :
“There will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose to use that car exclusively. You can choose to have it used only by friends and family or other drivers who are rated five stars. You can choose to share it sometimes but not other times. That’s 100% what will occur.”

FAQ: http://bit.ly/2u9uJxX

The list itself is completely objective based on placings and players beaten. However, to create the X-factor a survey was conducted among a panel of community leaders, tournament organizers, and top players from around the world. The X-factor is the difference between their #PGRv4 placing and how they were rated by the panel.

Our bucket list ride is a mix of tough climbs, sinuous descents, and ridiculously perfect road surfaces, all surrounded by the breathtaking scenery of Gran Canaria. Also, as far as we're concerned a ride cannot be considered for a bucket list ride if it's not got a number of cafe stops, which of course ours features.

I've always been a fan of big mudguards to get that ultimate clear vision when racing but I was intrigued to know what that actual difference was.

I'm always surprised when people choose to run the smaller mudguards because they ""look better"" Ah well, you enjoy getting that crap out your eye while I crack on with my ride.

Side note, big mudguards keep your camera clear too!

This tiny piglet and her golden retriever best friend love eating, bathing and even going on walkies together.

When Luna the mini pig first arrived home in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, in August 2017, there were teething troubles between her and canine companion Cloud.

Despite their size difference, the four-year-old Golden Retriever will lead the Juliana pig on walks around their back yard while holding a leash in her mouth.

The pair have quickly become bosom buddies through spending their days in the back-yard play fighting, sharing snacks and sitting in a paddling pool.

Chris King components are always instantly recognisable, and even if you can't see them, you'll always hear Chris King hubs coming.

We were lucky enough to get to pick Chris King's brain for a while at the recent Bristol Bespoked Bike Show. Discussing everything from the first headset he made, to what should be the only bottom bracket ""standard"", we really could have stayed and listened to Chris all day. 

Which other legends of the cycling tech industry would you like us to speak to next?

While it's clear that Hela is based heavily on her comic counterpart, there are a lot of big changes to the character that you may have missed. In this video, I take a look at six comic characters and one broader concept that in one way or another influenced the MCU's take on Hela.

SPOILERS for Thor: Ragnarok and to a much smaller extent, other movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

Special thanks to Youtubers MCU Scenes and Janootz for clueing me into the Gorr connection.

MY VLOG SERIES - A SNEAK PEAK INTO HOLLYWOOD AND BEHIND THE SCENES:
I also have a VLOG series where I take you behind the scenes from when I meet with Hollywood stars at different interview locations and give you a little sneak peak of what it's like to interview some of Hollywoods biggest stars. In my VLOGS I also take you to premieres, Hollywood parties, premiere after-parties, red carpets, The Oscars, The Golden Globes - and travels to film festivals, like Toronto, Cannes and Venice, comic-con in San Diego, as well as the typical film junket. I share some of my favorite interview tricks, some amazing, funny moments, but also some of my bloopers and less proud or awkward moments. So please come along for the ride behind the scenes in Hollywood, and don’t hesitate to ask questions or leave comments in the description section. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

How Slavoj Zizek provoked Jordan Peterson: 
Zizek's essay for the Independent ""Why do people find Jordan Peterson so convincing?"" provoked a defensive reaction from both Peterson and his fans. This video will explore just why Žižek wrote the essay the way he did and how Žižek's assessment that Peterson's hot takes on subjects like white privilege and neo-Marxists ought to be slotted next the pseudo-observations of clowns like Milo Yiannopoulos.

YOU KNOW I had to bring y'all to 7-ELEVEN in Taipei, Taiwan. 7 eleven in Asia is on a whole other level with their food variety. For me, I go to 7-eleven about 7-10 times a week. I eat there, pay my bills there, get coffee there, buy train tickets, refill my metro card...I mean the list goes on.

Having grown up in both Taiwan and the States, the importance of 7-Eleven is VERY different. Here in Taiwan, the convenience store is a day-to-day visit for us. We have 7-Eleven, Family Mart, and Hi-Life as the main ones. You can find it almost every 2-3 blocks. So you KNOW the food options are going to be AMAZING.

7-Eleven convenience store foods to try include:

1. TEA EGGS - marinated eggs
2. BUNS - fluffy buns with pork filling. Sometimes they have plain baos!
3. HOTPOT FOODS - instant hotpot items boiled for your consumption
4. BENTO - curry, mapo tofu, chicken fillet, dumplings bento boxes...I mean the microwave foods are things you'd want to order at a Chinese restuarant
5. COLD NOODLES - this is a personal fave of mine! Cold noodles with sesame paste
6. ONIGIRI - definitely a Japanese food but Taiwan is heavily influenced by Japan so yup - we love these! Rice with different fillings from pork floss to tuna to chicken, etc.
7. TAIWANESE SNACKS - yooooo...Taiwanese snacks are crispy, sweet, spicy, and just darn delicious. Buy a ton and do a Taiwanese snack taste test!
8. RAMEN - if you can eat meat, get the Taiwanese beef noodle ramen. They have actual beef chunks in it - amazing.
9. ASIAN BREAD - pineapple bun, chocolate bread, cheese loafs, etc. etc.
10. DRINKS - tea on tea on TEA! Milk tea, oolong tea, get your tea on.

Just because a director is willing to push the boundaries of decency in the name of entertainment doesn't mean they're guaranteed to get away with it. Sometimes, studios are forced to drop controversial scenes entirely, either to get a better rating, or because of public outcry. Here's a look at some offensive movie scenes you never got to see…

I call it the greatest college game ever played! It was a game for the ages as Alabama squeaked past Georgia in a thrilling 26-23 OT win for the national championship, as a freshman named Tua Tagovailoa with virtually no meaningful game experience was called on to lead his team to victory on the biggest stage in scholastic football.

True freshman QB Tua Tagovailoa hasn’t played much at all this season, but his number was called by coach Nick Saban after Alabama trailed 13-0 at halftime.

After a somewhat shaky start, which included an interception, Tagovailoa settled in and eventually went 14-24 for 166 yards and 3 TD passes, including the dramatic 41-yard game winner in OT on an improbable 2nd down and 26 play. He had just made a freshman mistake, taking a huge sack instead of throwing the ball away. Undeterred, Tagovailoa took the very next snap and launched a bullet right on target to a streaking Devonta Smith and the celebration was on.
As the cameras descended on Tua Tagovailoa, the first thing he did was thank Jesus and give all the glory to God.

“First and foremost I’d like to thank my Savior, Jesus Christ. With Him all things are possible,” he said before later adding, “All glory goes to God. I can’t describe what He’s done for me and my family. Who would’ve ever thought I would’ve been here right now in this moment? And I thank God for that.”
Incredible. Here’s a young kid with the world on his shoulders, he’s just achieved legend status, and is still thinking of God first.
The shout out to God doesn’t appear to be just lip service. Before the cameras were on him, God was at the center of the conversation. Here’s part of a Q & A he did with AL.com last year, in which he said he liked Alabama because the coaches and players went to church:
What were the lasting impressions from your trip to Tuscaloosa last month?
“There were so many things, but the most important one is when I went to church with one of the coaches. It was amazing to see coaches going to church. I got to see players going to church. It was amazing to see. I was raised going to church every Sunday. The atmosphere over there, it’s just amazing over there.”
What would you like the fans to know about you off the field?
“I feel that’s not up to me. That’s up to the fans. They’ve been watching the film. I’m just doing my job and my job is to play the sport that I love. I use my sport and my talent as a tool to spread God’s word. Whatever I get out of it, all glory goes to Him.”
And yes, his name is a tricky one to pronounce—just watch these Alabama students try and attempt to say Tua Tagovailoa.

Now graduated from college and out in the real world where it takes more than a cappella to get by, the Bellas return in Pitch Perfect 3, the next chapter in the beloved series that has taken in more than $400 million at the global box office. 

After the highs of winning the World Championships, the Bellas find themselves split apart and discovering there aren’t job prospects for making music with your mouth. But when they get the chance to reunite for an overseas USO tour, this group of awesome nerds will come together to make some music, and some questionable decisions, one last time.

For three decades, both countries achieved huge growth rates, which allowed both Japan and Germany not only to recover from the damage caused by World War II, but even to become some of the richest countries in the world.

However, in Japan, the model came to a sudden halt between 1989 and the early 1990s. Today, the German model has shown itself as superior and has reaped better economic and social results.

So the question we ask ourselves in this video is, why has the German model been better than the Japanese? Why has Germany performed better than Japan for the last decades? Some possible answers, which we discuss in this video, have a lot to do with the Keiretsu, how the Yen and the Marco were managed differently, and a very different immigration policy.

In this clip, lightfoot crabs leap from rock to rock, desperately avoiding the water - their lives depend on it. Moray eels launch themselves from rock pools, jaw gaping. Then octopuses, too. Both crawl across dry rock to set their ambush. Elsewhere, the ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares.

This episode is a rollercoaster ride of heart-stopping action and epic drama, peopled with characters from the beautiful to the bizarre. We meet fish that live on dry land and puffins that must travel 60 miles or more for a single meal, and witness a life-and-death struggle in a technicolour rock pool.

In a secluded cove in the Galapagos, sea lions feast on 60kg tuna. It should be impossible - tuna are usually far too fast for sea lions to catch. But here the sea lions club together to herd their prey inshore. Once trapped in the shallows, these huge fish are easy pickings.

“Ann Coulter, conservative commentator and consistent supporter of President Donald Trump, has turned on the president after his bipartisan meeting on Tuesday to discuss the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and other immigration policies.

On Tuesday a judge blocked Trump's September decision to end the program, which followed a meeting the president held with Republicans and Democrats to discuss immigration policy.

That evening, Coulter posted a series of angry tweets that accused Trump of conducting the “DACA lovefest” meeting to counter negative press from the recently released Michael Wolff book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.”

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 19, 2017 – Boeing [NYSE:BA] for the first time is showing what it believes is the unmanned aircraft system (UAS) best suited for refueling U.S. Navy jets operating from aircraft carriers.

Through its MQ-25 competition, the Navy is seeking unmanned refueling capabilities that would extend the combat range of deployed Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, Boeing EA-18G Growler, and Lockheed Martin F-35C fighters. The MQ-25 will also have to seamlessly integrate with a carrier’s catapult and launch and recovery systems.

“Boeing has been delivering carrier aircraft to the Navy for almost 90 years,” said Don ‘BD’ Gaddis, a retired admiral who leads the refueling system program for Boeing’s Phantom Works technology organization. “Our expertise gives us confidence in our approach. We will be ready for flight testing when the engineering and manufacturing development contract is awarded.”

The UAS is completing engine runs before heading to the flight ramp for deck handling demonstrations early next year.

The Navy issued its final request for proposals in October.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

Amber Mozo is a 22-year-old photographer born and raised on the North Shore of Oahu. As the daughter of legendary surf photographer Jon Mozo, a former fixture in the lineups along the famed North Shore, Amber was raised with a love for both the ocean and photography.

Jon Mozo passed away while shooting photos in the water at Pipeline — he was 33 years old. Amber was only 9. Soon after her father’s passing, Amber picked up a camera and her photographic journey began.

While photography has taken Amber all around the world, shooting some of the most beautiful known surf breaks, until this winter, she hadn’t yet swam out into the lineup that stole her father’s life — Pipeline. This winter, however, under the tutelage of fellow North Shore surf photographer, Zak Noyle, Amber swam into the Pipeline lineup for the very first time during the 2018 Volcom Pipe Pro.

vu26EhE8tMU,-GvVeT7pNT8,3rd December | Emily Ratajkowski by Phil Poynter | Love Advent 2017,LOVE Magazine,22.0,2017-12-03 08:32:13+00:00,[],1331234.0,3944.0,1386.0,477.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vu26EhE8tMU/default.jpg,"Emily doesn’t exercise and when Katie Grand told her about the #staystrong concept and asked her what she wanted to do exercise wise, she asked to eat pasta and drink red wine as her exercise. Lolz so she was named Carb Loading Day - which is in fact a real thing for athletes.
 
Emily says, “To me, female sexuality and sexiness, no matter how conditioned it may be by a patriarchal ideal, can be incredibly empowering for a woman if she feels it is empowering to her. The way I dress, act, flirt, dance, have sex - those are my decisions and they shouldn't be impacted by men. Being sexy is fun and I like it. I should never have to apologize for that. My life is on my terms and if I feel like putting on sexy underwear, it’s for me. Personal choice is the core ideal in my concept of feminism. Katie directed us to say ‘Stay Strong’ at the end of each video and I think it's a message from one woman to another. You're watching a video of a girl grinding in lingerie or whatever else and she is looking into the camera at the end saying, ‘you do you, however YOU want to, fuck the rest’. In the wake of the Harvey fallout and women coming forward with incredible amounts of sexual harassment cases, I have been so disappointed to hear women talk about ""modesty"" and ""our responsibility"" as if we need to, yet again, adjust to make it ""easier"" for the rest of the world. I'm tired of having to consider how I might be perceived by men if I wear the short skirt or post a sexy Instagram. I want to do what I want to do. Feminism isn't about adjusting, it's about freedom and choice.
Do you think viewers will understand that, given the current wider conversation about the sexual objectification of women? why or why not? What are the risks? This is something I've battled with personally and publicly. I've had men comment on sexy images of me online and say ""this is empowering to you? Ha! I just masturbated to it so hope you feel good about yourself!"" I guess that's the way people can react, which ironically, ultimately serves my point. I don't care about your reaction or what you do with my expression of self. In fact, it has nothing to do with you at all and that's the point-which is why it feels good. Ultimately, if a woman wants to wear a burka or nothing at all, it's great if it's what she wants and feels good about.”

CHILDISH GAMBINO IS BACK ON HIS RAP GRIND BABY! The musical project of actor/musician/comedian/writer Donald Glover returns with ""THIS IS AMERICA"", what is hopefully the first single from his upcoming 4th album. Glover recently inked a new record deal with RCA after leaving Glassnote, and isn't afraid to make bold statements with his new video and song.

From the 2017 Classic Tetris World Championship, Round 4 matches:  

Hauser (5) vs Alex Kerr (17)
Matt Buco (7) vs Jonas Neubauer (3)

With full commentary by Chris Tang and James Chen, these matches are some real gems for all you Tetris fans out there!

In the 1990 Nintendo World Championship competition, Tetris was the game to beat. The winner, Thor Aackerlund, is still seen by many as the best to have ever played. Today’s Classic Tetris tournaments are played on that same version of Nintendo Tetris, using original NES game systems, controllers, and Tetris cartridges. In 2009, a player named Harry Hong became the first to achieve the highest possible score of 999,999 points. Inspired by this achievement, filmmaker Adam Cornelius produced a short film about Harry called “Max-Out”, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to document the world of competitive Tetris. As word of Adam’s Kickstarter campaign spread, rumors of max-out scores from other Tetris Masters began to surface, threatening the supremacy of Harry’s achievement. With the help of Nintendo World Championship veteran Robin Mihara, Adam searched for all of the Tetris Masters he could find. Jonas Neubauer emerged as an early max-out artist, along with the elusive original champ Thor Aackerlund. The idea of bringing these and other NES Tetris Masters together to compete in a live tournament became an obvious and irresistible proposition which was artfully captured in the 2010 feature length documentary Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters. Under the leadership of producer Vince Clemente, The Classic Tetris World Championship is currently held at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, an annual event which has hosted the tournament since 2012. Chuck Van Pelt and his organizing committee have built the PRGE into the largest classic gaming expo in the country, drawing around 6,000 attendees. Every year the scores get higher. Rivalries are revisited once again, and new players emerge to challenge the old guard. Over 20 players have maxed out the score now. Will you be the next?

""Gentleman"" Lyrics
 
V1:
know it’s winter somewhere,
but it’s spring time right here
you need me to water the grass before it all disappears
say you’re sick of that high school shit,
you need a college degree
so you took all your frustration to me

Chorus: 
tell me have you ever had a gentleman?
if not, then girl you deserve a gentleman
eat you out for dinner like a gentleman,
knock before I enter like a gentleman
x2

V2:
said fuck it with that subtle and slow
nah, we don’t want that— throw yourself on like it’s meant to be
leave you with a fifth of your sanity

Chorus: 
tell me have you ever had a gentleman?
if not, then girl you deserve a gentleman
eat you out for dinner like a gentleman,
knock before I enter like a gentleman
x2

Bridge:
take what you want, don’t be scared
girl you know i’ve been here before
you can’t ignore all the signs that you feel
when you’re touching and kissing my neck
girl you know what you want and I’m here to give it to you

Chorus: 
tell me have you ever had a gentleman?
if not, then girl you deserve a gentleman
eat you out for dinner like a gentleman,
knock before I enter like a gentleman

Congratulations to Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) who recently was awarded a Michelin Star!

Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) is no doubt one of the most legendary Thai street food restaurants in Bangkok - some people are loyal fans, others say that it’s overpriced. It’s a Thai restaurants in Bangkok that I had been wanting to eat at for a long time, but never got around to it - partly because it is so expensive. So finally one day for lunch, Ying and I drove over to central Bangkok to try Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) for the first time.

But really quickly, about the name....

In Thai, Jay (เจ๊) means a Chinese Aunty and Fai (ไฝ) means a mole, yes a mole. What I can tell you first about the restaurant is that the owner is absolutely awesome. She wears ski goggles and a snow cap while she’s cooking, and she cooks over huge fire charcoal, fanning the flame as she expertly cooks. She’s also quite a character, and she loves to chat - so while I was filming she shared all about herself, and how her method of cooking her legendary Thai crab omelet ensures that it doesn’t soak up very much oil. It’s indeed the most amazing omelet you might ever see in your life.

Crab omelet (ไข่เจียวปู) - You can either order the 800 THB or the 1000 THB crab omelet, I went with the 1000 THB. It’s huge, but only uses 2 eggs, but it’s packed with shell less crab nuggets. The omelet is cooked burrito style, and  it’s massive. It’s a must order when you eat at Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ).

Drunken noodles (เส้นใหญ่ผัดขี้เมาทะเล) - Her version of Thai drunken noodles (pad kee mao sen ya) is the dish I would come back for over and over again. Again, it’s not  cheap,  but the quality of seafood and the seasoning that she uses is superb. The balance of flavor will blow your mind - it’s really the best plate of Thai drunken noodles I’ve had in Bangkok.

Tom yum goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง) - For our final dish we tried Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) tom yum  goong. Again, massive prawns and seafood were used, and she cooked it over charcoal. It was awesomely delicious, sour, and flavorful.

Conclusion:
Eating at Thai street food restaurants like this can be all about expectations. You have to go in knowing the prices are very high and you’re going to spend way more money than going to any other corner Thai street food restaurant. That being said, it’s a one-of-a-kind historical culinary legend of a restaurant in Bangkok. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience eat at Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ),  and it was an honor to stand there and talk with Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ), and then eat her cooking.

Total price - 2,370 THB ($72.32)

Rome, 1973. Masked men kidnap a teenage boy named Paul. His grandfather, J. Paul Getty, is the richest man in the world, a billionaire oil magnate, but he's notoriously miserly. His favorite grandson's abduction is not reason enough for him to part with any of his fortune. 'All the Money in the World' follows Gail, Paul's devoted, strong-willed mother, who unlike Getty, has consistently chosen her children over his fortune. Her son's life in the balance with time running out, she attempts to sway Getty even as her son's mob captors become increasingly more determined, volatile and brutal. When Getty sends his enigmatic security man Fletcher Chace to look after his interests, he and Gail become unlikely allies in this race against time that ultimately reveals the true and lasting value of love over money.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

[ PENTAGON ]

PENTAGON returns with its fifth mini album, all of which are self-written songs again, in November 2017.

The title track ‘RUNAWAY’ gives an unexpected thrill from the beginning with the strong intro and the powerful sounds that draw you in. The music video catches your eyes by describing the hope for a new start without giving up despite the unstable future. It continued the story of the last title track ‘Like This’ that expressed the pains of the wandering youth.

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w-90gDyu0Go/sddefault.jpg,0.01169321365570198,0.0003631835633495901,32.19642857142857,0.0007750077825049289,0.012056397219051572,0.0128314050015565,2018-03-08,06:05:49,Thursday,3,10,37,10,32,57,322,2,76,0,1,8,16,5,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.287032289141551,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Paisley Park is a self-contained 55,000 square foot, $10 million creative-complex located in Chanhassen, Minnesota (about 22 miles outside of Minneapolis).  Prince came up with the idea to build the complex while filming the movie Purple Rain.

Construction started on the project in 1986 and it was completed 1988.  The complex contains 2 recording studios, a video editing suite, wardrobe department, sound-stage, offices, his music vault and living space.

Prince lived the last year of his life at Paisley Park.

These pictures were taken by the Carver Police Department the day of his passing as well as a couple weeks later during the execution of a search warrant.

Hopefully these photos give you a better appreciation for Prince.  He lived a bit more humbly than most people would imagine.  For people that have taken the tour, it'll give you the opportunity to see spaces in the complex off limits during the tours.

Because of copyright issues there is no Prince music in this video.   Instead I have used music that means something to me.  You might not like it or think it fits, but we all have different tastes.

subtitles available.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand my upload schedule. The timings are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of advanced procrastination most of my uploads will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jeff's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Zarya literature, for instance. My fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about JEFF. As a consequence people who dislike my videos truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Jeff's existential catchphrase ""What's up everyone, this is Jeff from the Overwatch team,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Gravitons and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as my genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Jeff Kaplan tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for Blizzard employee eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 SR points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.

went a month without uploading. oops. next vid will be around the 5th of July hopefully. i've finally purchased the parts for a new computer, so i am hoping to expand the type of videos i create in the near future. possibly have a crack at SFM, and will be able to actually record gameplay at a fair framerate. don't worry, not planning on going down the memetage route though. i say i'll have a new computer ""in the near future"", but it's gonna take at least another month before the parts are all delivered. anyway, i'm boring myself here with this lame ass description.

later nerds.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w0u0ZSqy908/sddefault.jpg,0.015507447352538737,0.000907595700668488,17.086294416243653,0.0010780578373422649,0.016415043053207217,0.017493100890549486,2017-11-17,06:06:46,Friday,4,9,38,9,33,52,334,1,79,0,1,6,14,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['~  CORDEN', '', '   ', '', 'ai', 'OW', 'piss']","['~', 'CORDEN', 'ai', 'OW', 'piss']",True,"['~', 'corden', 'ai', 'OW', 'piss']",5,5,15,1,1,0,0,5.602463476335197,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

1) Original Mar-Vell to appear in Captain Marvel with Jude Law entering negotiations to star

2) ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ Tracking to Open Over $200 Million

3) Box Office Report

4) First trailer for ‘Smallfoot’ starring Channing Tatum released

5) First short tease from Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom released

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

1) Variety is reporting that Jude Law has entered negotiations to join Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn in Marvel’s Captain Marvel. Law will be playing Doctor Walter Lawson, a.k.a. Mar-Vell, who becomes a mentor to Larson’s Danvers as she tries to figure out her new powers. Half Nelson directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are directing the film that will be set in the ’90s before the Avengers Assembled, with the Skrulls and Mendelsohn playing the villains in the movie. Captain Marvel is set to hit theatres on March 8, 2019.

According to a report from THR, analysts predict that Star Wars The Last Jedi will open above $200 million dollars domestic, putting the eighth episode in the Skywalker saga the fourth movie ever to achieve such a feat after The Force Awakens, The Avengers, and Jurassic World. Although THR doesn’t specify if they think The Last Jedi can beat out The Force Awakens, many predictions place the movie opening below The Force Awakens’ $248 million domestic haul from two years back.

BOX OFFICE REPORT

BUY OR SELL

Warner Bros. and Warner Animation Group have released the first trailer for the animated adventure-comedy, Smallfoot. Starring the voices of Channing Tatum, James Corden, Zendaya, Danny DeVito and LeBron James, Smallfoot turns the Bigfoot legend upside down when a bright young Yeti finds something he thought didn’t exist—a human. Smallfoot arrives in theaters on September 28, 2018.

Universal Pictures (via a tweet from Colin Trevorrow) have released the first trailer tease for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The small tease will be attached to a longer trailer that some expect to debut ahead of Star Wars The Last Jedi.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi generated quite a bit of controversy and differing opinions upon release, whether we're talking about Rey's parents or Luke Skywalker's death. I decided to study this matter further and find out where all the negativity is coming from, and how it might affect the upcoming finale to the trilogy, Star Wars: Episode IX directed by JJ Abrams.

This theory-examination-thingy turned out to way longer than I expected, but I hope you like it. And it did finish nicely for the Bluray release, since deleted scenes and bonus features seem to be all the rave now. And there's a documentary too I hear.

Opinions? What did you think about Episode VIII and are you awaiting to see what happens in Episode 9? There was cool stuff. Like the throne room scene and the salt planet attack. Visually very impressive. Also Avengers Infinity War is coming out and that looks pretty good as well.

Brace yourself boy  
She's dancing in your headlights  
Drifting  
Trying not to fall like  
Permanently in your arms 
Out of nowhere 
She's leaning in your window  
Singing  
Songs out your soundtrack  
Play it back 
Permanently into your heart  

I was in the back room  
Dreamin’ out loud before I found you  
I was stuck on that phone call  
Tom Petty waiting on a free fall  

Sometimes we Brace  
And then fall  
Sometimes we don't feel right  
Sometimes we don't fall at all  

Thank you my love  
My little war is over  
Sometimes I don't think straight  
Drifting  
Drifting  
Permanently out of your arms  
Then out of nowhere  
You’re leaning in my window singing 
Songs out of my sound track  
play it back 
permanently into my heart 

 I was in the back room  
Dreamin out loud before I found you  
I was stuck on that phone call  
Tom Petty  waiting on a free fall  
 
Sometimes we Brace  
And then fall  
Sometimes we don't feel right  
Sometimes we don't fall at all  

 I was broken hearted  
From the ones who hurt to love  
But when you're lion hearted 
You let em fall, you let em fall back in your arms yea  

I was in the back room  
Dreamin out loud before I found you  
I was stuck on that phone call

Here is what you'll need!

SIX-CHEESE MACARONI AND CHEESE
Servings: 10-12

INGREDIENTS
¼ cup butter
¼ cup flour
2½ cups milk
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoon mustard powder
½ teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 cup shredded cheddar (divided)
½ cup shredded Gruyère
½ cup shredded provolone
1 cup shredded mozzarella (divided)
½ cup shredded Colby Jack
½ cup shredded Gouda
1 pound macaroni, cooked al dente
¼ cup panko bread crumbs

PREPARATION
In a pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter and whisk in the flour until well-incorporated, about one minute.
Add the milk a few tablespoons at a time, whisking constantly until absorbed. It will clump up initially. Keep adding the milk until fully absorbed and the mixture is smooth and creamy.
Reduce the heat to low and add garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, cayenne, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Add a ½ cup of cheddar, Gruyère, provolone, ½ cup of mozzarella, Colby Jack, and Gouda. Stir until smooth.
Add the cooked macaroni and mix until fully coated.
Pour the mac and cheese into a baking dish and top with the remaining mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and bread crumbs.
Broil on high for 5-7 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!

One of my local friends suggested Central Mercado a wonderfully vibrant night market in the heart of Manila.

The night market first of all, smelled incredible. From the roasted meat skewers to the refreshing local drinks, there was something for everyone at this night market.

Having filled up on great eats at this night market, I proceeded to a local restaurant that many locals recommended for a taste of Dinuguan which is essentially pork blood stew with organ meat inside.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Storm ""Friederike"" was the strongest storm in germany since 11 years. Pilots had to deal with wind speeds up to 75knts.

As a result I was able to film lots of ""go arounds"". Some pilots had to do three approaches until they finaly managed to land at Düsseldorf. Other pilots just tried it once and diverted to other airpots, like the Delta Boeing 767-400 for example.

Especialy the second landing, a Dash 8 of Eurowings did an incredible approach while fighting with extreme wind gusts at Düsseldorf Airport.

blackbear - anxiety (ft. FRND) Lyrics

[Intro: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: blackbear]
Every time you cross my mind, you get right under my skin
Am I crazy out my mind the situation I'm in
And it gets harder just to breathe, feel like the walls are closing in
But all I need is some closure

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
Yeah, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me

[Chorus: blackbear]
Anxiet xiet-xiet xiet-xiet xiet xiety
Xiet-xiet-xiet-xiet
Give me anxiety
Anxiet xiet-xiet xiet-xiet xiet xiety-ty
Xiet-xiet-xiet-xiet
Anxiety

[Verse 2: FRND]
Every time I smile what I'm doing fine, does it show?
'Cause' I'm really freaking out, too scared of letting you go
Then my heart drowns out my thoughts, my head's about to explode
What I need is some closure

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Anxiet xiet-xiet xiet-xiet xiet xiety
Xiet-xiet-xiet-xiet
Give me anxiety
Anxiet xiet-xiet xiet-xiet xiet xiety-ty
Xiet-xiet-xiet-xiet xiet-xiety
Anxiety

[Bridge: FRND]
It feels way inside of me
Every time I smile what I'm doing fine, does it show?
'Cause' I'm really freaking out, too scared of letting you go

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me anxiety

[Outro: blackbear]
Anxiety
Give me anxiety
Anxiety

Moderated by Kevin Vlk

ABOUT ""ANNIHILATION""
Based on Jeff VanderMeer’s best-selling Southern Reach Trilogy, ""Annihilation"" follows a group of soldiers who enter an environmental disaster zone and only one soldier (Oscar Isaac) comes back out alive, though he is grievously injured. In an attempt to save his life, his wife Lena (Natalie Portman), a biologist, volunteers for another expedition into the zone to figure out what happened to him. The film stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. Written and directed by Alex Garland (28 Day Later, Ex Machina).

""Annihilation"" in theaters February 23, 2018.

Stick around to the end to hear about a potential hint from Nintendo about re-releasing Gamecube content in 2018!

LeBron James achieved another first Tuesday night, albeit one he'd probably like to forget. For the first time in his career, he was ejected from a basketball game.
The Cleveland Cavaliers star was tossed during NBA regular-season game No. 1,082 -Tuesday’s win over the Miami Heat with 1:59 left in the third quarter.
James had just missed a shot as he drove to the basket and believed he was fouled. He complained and continued to yell at referee Kane Fitzgerald, who gave him a technical foul and then ejected him.
James told NBA TV after the game: “I’ve never been thrown out in my life. They always say there’s a first time for everything. Tonight was the night.”

Then we're off to Staten Island with VICE security guard and foodie extraordinaire Vic Zagami to get some crispy bar pies and the legendary vodka pie at Goodfella's. The episode ends with a visit to the Bronx for a walk down Arthur Avenue with Mark Iacono, Frank's favorite pizza friend. Frank and Mark's walk is filled with fresh cheese, prosciutto, clams, tripe—and, of course, more pizza.

▸ Lyrics for Alison Wonderland - Awake (Lyrics / Lyric Video) 

[Verse 1]
I was alone, I was a fool
Looking at you
Thinking I knew you
Picked up my phone, nothing to lose
All of a sudden it's color blue

[Pre-Chorus]
I get it, I messed up, you pushed it, I fell off
You'll always be better in your own eyes
I get it, I messed up, you pushed it, I fell off
You'll always be better in your own eyes

[Chorus]
Goodbye my friend
It's been too long
I know you've been away
Too much was said
Too much was done
And now I'm wide awake
Awake, awake, awake, awake

[Verse 2]
I know it's too late, I know where it's left
And now I see space in the bed that we slept
There's no way to change
It's been a short while
The only way up is accepting your smile

[Pre-Chorus]
I get it, I've messed up, you pushed it, I fell off
You'll always be better in your own eyes
I get it, I've messed up, you pushed it, I fell off
You'll always be better in your own eyes

[Chorus]
Goodbye my friend
It's been too long
I know you've been away
Too much was said
Too much was done
And now I'm wide awake (yeah)
Awake, awake, awake, awake

[Bridge]
Awake, awake, awake, awake

[Chorus]
Goodbye my friend
It's been too long
I know you've been away
Too much was said
Too much was done
And now I'm wide awake (yeah)
Awake, awake, awake, awake

[Outro]
Awake, awake, awake, awake

It’s ZOMS Vs POMS!

Welcome to Seabrook, just your normal, picture-perfect town… if that town had a mysterious green gas leak causing a zombie apocalypse! 😱

Fast forward 50 years and the Zombies, thanks to the Z-band, now pose no threat to the humans and the two live harmoniously in the town (kinda). The Zombies have been banished to the isolated outskirts of Seabrook and must live in the run down ‘Zombietown’ 🏚, interacting as little as possible with the ‘Normals’ (humans). BUT THEN, life as they know it is officially changed forever when the Zoms find out they can FINALLY enrol in Seabrook High School 🏫. How will the ‘normals’ take it… you’ll have to watch to find out!

ZOMS
All they want is to be treated like anyone else, go to normal school, hang out with the human kids and NOT be treated like freaks. But some humans (and by that we mean most) still think that they will be a zombie’s main course if they are anywhere near them. SO, for now, zombies at Seabrook High must come in a different entrance and have all their classes in the basement. Oh, and the school has a built in Zombie panic room, in case they try to, you know… eat anyone. 🆘

POMS
Omg! 😆 Being a cheerleader at Seabrook High is the ultimate indicator of social status, and everybody who’s anybody knows it. Their main job alongside maintaining school pep, is to cheer on the Seabrook High football team A.K.A the Mighty Shrimp… GOoooooo Shrimps! 🏈

As if this film isn’t already jam packed full of pom-poms, spirit, pep, cheer and best of all zombies, it also has some awesome tunes like ‘Bamm’, ‘Fired up’, ‘Someday’ and ‘My Year’ that will make any Zombie you feel alive!

Who’s who?

Zed (Milo Manheim) is team Zombie. Zed and his friends Eliza & Bonzo are among the first few zombies that have actually been allowed to enrol in Seabrook High School. He believes if he joins the Mighty Shrimp that one day humans and zombies will live happily in Seabrook and everyone will be treated the same. Dream on Zed, dream on. 👫💭

Addison (Meg Donnelly) is team Pom. Addison has always wanted to follow in her cousin Bucky’s footsteps and become a Seabrook cheerleader 📣, so when she is picked to join the squad as a freshman it’s a dream come true! But she is hiding a secret, and although she might look the part on team Pom, she knows what it is like to be different.

Bucky (Trevor Tordjman) is the leader of team Pom 🤸. As head cheerleader, he is responsible for hiring and more often firing the members of the squad. Due to this power, he pretty much controls the entire school and his dislike for the zombies soon becomes everyone’s view.

Eliza (Kylee Russell) is team Zom. She is not only Zed’s bestie but a complete computer whiz that could hack in her sleep 💻! She unlike Zed, is more suspicious of the humans especially Bucky and his posse of pom-poms. She doesn’t believe that humans and zombies will ever get along but that doesn’t mean she won’t help Zed out with his plans.

Zoey (Kingston Foster) is team Zom. Zoey is Zedd’s little sis and although she might be a zombie she is SUPER CUTE! It is her dream to one day become a Seabrook cheerleader, but zombies aren’t allowed to try out. Let’s hope her big bro comes through and mends this divided town! 💚

Bonzo (James Godfrey) is definitely team Zom! He the third member in the little trio and the peacemaker of the group – even if he can only speak in zombie!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w7t2wNacl5s/sddefault.jpg,0.008401265830300368,0.00024124148116019654,34.825129533678755,0.00014905723641633903,0.008642507311460566,0.008791564547876905,2018-03-03,10:30:01,Saturday,5,12,74,11,67,69,619,8,157,2,0,7,8,1,2,5.0,7.0,"['/', '', 'cones']","['/', 'cones']",True,"['/', 'cone']",2,2,5,1,0,0,0,6.4644709855134685,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Ronald Jamal Everett - True talk, when I heard Favreau was going to be doing a Star Wars show I just about shit myself. No lie, this man is going to deliver! Iron Man is still my favorite superhero movie and what he did with Jungle Book is crazy. Why would anyone not be happy about this??? Never really cared if they did a Star Wars tv show, but now I can’t wait!

Carnell - Prior to prequels release, I felt it was a missed opportunity to already know it was the story of Anakin's fall. I felt Lucas shouldn’t assume that we know who Darth Vader is. (I know, ridiculous) But new fans could watch the prequels and move on to original trilogy. The reveal in ep. 5 wouldn’t already be spoiled.

Vrinder Singh Johal - Hey John , love the show. Return of the Jedi is my favourite Star Wars movie but I was wondering why I’ve never heard much if any praise for the director Richard Marquand . Can you tell me why?

Dani Rivera - Even though the Snoke conspiracies were pretty much over after The Last Jedi, I can’t help but wonder... What if JJ’s original plan WAS to have Snoke be Darth Plagueis and expand his story in the next episodes, and then Rian Johnson was like, nah, I wanna focus on Kylo, I’m cutting him off (no pun intended). Your thoughts?

YoMamma - I have always felt that Han's death in TFA was missing just a little bit. The fact that he dies at the hand of his son never really hits that hard for me while watching the movie. What do you think are some easy ways they could have added a little depth to that relationship to make that moment hit a little harder?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w7wDv1JaZSE/hqdefault.jpg,0.040317409426098114,0.0040076947739660146,10.06,0.01090092978518756,0.04432510420006412,0.05522603398525169,2018-03-12,00:57:52,Monday,0,12,23,10,23,65,176,1,40,0,0,11,23,0,0,4.0,7.0,"['x', '—_', '=', 'y', '<', '=', '~ 4', 'as']","['x', '—_', '=', 'y', '<', '=', '~', '4', 'as']",True,"['x', '—_', '=', 'y', '<', '=', '~', '4', 'as']",9,8,11,4,0,0,2,6.458059404766376,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

If you haven't seen Deadpool, but you like what you see from Deadpool 2's amazing marketing campaign, then you should probably go rent Deadpool. It's pretty hilarious, but it's not for kids. Even though the sequel is only the second movie in the series, it's a part of the long-running, extra-confusing X-Men franchise. Making matters even crazier, Deadpool 2 is bringing in a ton of extra heroes from the comics. If you're planning to see the Merc with a Mouth in action, but just don't have the time for Deadpool, or maybe you just want to know who all these new people are, here's everything you need to know before seeing Deadpool 2...

#GringoMovie

About Gringo:
Mild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.

Targeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.

Pursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.
Directed by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.

Following his appearance in the ‘rondo’ with the rest of the squad, the French striker carried on his session alone as his recovery from injury continues. Other players who also continued with their solo recovery work after injury were Javier Mascherano and Rafinha.

About ayydubs:
My name is Alyx, or Ayydubs on the internet. You may have seen my Hidden Camera Uber Prank series, where I completely distress innocent people. If you can’t handle the cringe, I also make vlogs, advice videos, skits, sketches and whatever else I so please. New videos every Thursday.

We all know him as he is one of the most popular scientists, Stephen Hawking. He was suffering a disease as we know that is called ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) which had lowered his life expectancy. But what was the real reason of his death? How could he beat this chronic illness and survive for 50 plus years? This is still a mystery! In this video we will disclose the real reason why! Stephen Hawking has been an authority figure when it comes to black holes, time travel, artificial intelligence, future of humanity, alien life, mars mission etc. His fascination about science, space and the Universe continue to astound us!

XO Tour Llif3 has been smashing the charts for months now, and Uzi just released his ''Luv Is Rage 2'' album earlier this year. So musically speaking, Uzi is doing pretty well for himself. But apart from the music, there's been one word that's been constantly associated with Uzi - and the word is femininity. 

If you know anything about Uzi as a person, then you know that he's very expressive in the way that he carries himself. ''Uzi is being that way because he wants people to talk about him'' is a common phrase people say whenever they think about Lil Uzi Vert and his very flamboyant personality. But is Lil Uzi Vert really too feminine? That's what I talk about in this video. 

In this video I talk about whether or not Lil Uzi Vert is too feminine or not.

Solo A Star Wars Story Movie 2018 that is a prequel to the original Star Wars movies featuring Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Donald Glover as a young Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, and new characters played by Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany, and more. Plus rants on Star Wars the franchise. Did the movie come out okay or does it have issues due to changing directors from Lord & Miller to Ron Howard. Also a mini Star Wars rants...

LYRICS ::

I can keep a secret from my mama, I can keep a secret from my pa
I keep myself out of trouble, stay one step ahead of the law
And I can keep it from my neighbors – it ain't like they even care
But I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs

It's the patronage of strangers that's keeping me from being broke
But when they hand over the paycheck to me, they have to wonder where it goes
Because I never seem to save it – I sure ain't wasting it on clothes, nor soap
It's a mystery to you but there's a guy at the store that knows

Because by eleven in the morning, I'll find him selling smokes
Laughing in another language but we all know a joke's a joke
Then by seven in the evening, I'm darkening the door
Lord, it's so hard trying to keep a secret in that god damn store

He's there to see me buying cigarettes – he's there to see me buying beer
He's never seen me on the internet and five o'clock is nowhere near
But every day can be the weekend if you can walk a couple floors, take that three story tour
And make sure yr talking money when yr rocking with the boss at the store
I'm rocking with the boss

I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store
I can't keep a secret, I couldn't lie anymore
I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store
Why try like before?

Because you can lie with yr expression or lie with the things you say
But you can't lie with yr dollars, nah, babe – yr dollars, they give you away
And the faces on the paper, the faces from the paper glare
That's why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs

The money in the pocket, there's a fire burning there
That's why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs
It's glaringly apparent why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs
So why should I attempt it when I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs?

Here's the number of super useful recipes of handmade makeup items, not only they look great but also taste delicious! And not to mention, the positive effect on your skin! Give it a try! 

1. DIY lipstick with dry flowers
Probably you've already seen a stunning transparent lipstick that has recently gone viral. Don't buy it, DIY it! 
Take any transparent or semi-transparent lip balm and microwave it for 30 seconds. Place a dry flower inside a lipstick container and pour the balm inside. Let it cool down for 2 hours. Done! Lovely DIY lipstick is done and you didn't spend a dollar on it :)

2. Repair broken press powder
Have you broken your compact powder? Don't worry, don't throw it away - use our awesome life hack instead! Pour some alcohol and remove excess liquid with a paper towel. Press the powder with a coin and let it dry overnight. Great job! Your broken compact powder looks like new again!
This trick works with any powder makeup: powders, blushes, eye shadows and highlighters.

3. How to make a lip stain
DIY lip stain is a great solution for busy women who want their lipstick to stay put all day long. But don't waste your money on it! You can easily make it at home. Take some nontoxic school glue and mix it with a few drops of food coloring of your choice. Apply it on your lips with a lip brush and let it dry for 10 minutes. Now peel off the glue. Lovely! Now you have bold colored lips that will come off only in the end of the day.

FAQ:
Who is this lady?
Gina Petitti was born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy. Her family ran a farm in Italy and she met her husband, Vito, in the same town. In 1970 Gina, Vito, and her 4 children immigrated to America. Gina’s husband passed away in 2012, but she is surrounded by a large family, which includes 9 grandchildren, and lives 5 minutes away from her eldest daughter in New Jersey. Gina spends her time cooking, gardening, and being an active member of her local Church. 

Where does Gina get her recipes?
Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.

Why does she make such large portions?
When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldn’t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!

Why is no one helping her in the video?
Grandma Gina doesn’t want help! Usually, it’s because we will slow her down or not do it “her way.” For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  

Why don’t we buy her a new...?
Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etc… but she doesn’t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!

Who is behind the camera?
Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.

Does Gina read the comments?
We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking! Your comments bring her lots of joy, laughter, and inspiration to make more videos to share with you.

Common questions:
What distro do you use?
On my office PC I use Ubuntu 17.10 with the stylish Pop! theme by System76.

On my Steam Machine I now run Ubuntu 16.04 with the Steam Compositor and nomodeswitch packages installed. (This is because later versions of Ubuntu have PIE enabled by default which prevents me from using Dolphin)

What do you use to edit your videos?
Audio editing: Ocenaudio
Video editing: KdenLive

What are your machines specs?
Steam Machine: Intel Core i7 at 3.8 GHz, Nvidia GTX 970 4GB, 12 GB RAM, Ubuntu 16.10 w/ Steam Compositor

Office Rig: Intel Core i5 at 3.4 GHz, Nvidia GTX 750 Ti, 8 GB of RAM, Ubuntu 17.10

Server: AMD FX 6300 at 3.5 GHz, Nvidia GTX 750 1GB, and 8 GB RAM, Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMykVQucpUM/sddefault.jpg,0.011598195284166654,0.00035793064841349766,32.40347071583514,0.0005947394288172218,0.011956125932580152,0.012550865361397372,2018-03-26,01:13:17,Monday,0,15,52,13,50,86,484,1,121,1,3,10,0,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.137174397423368,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'handbag': 1, 'person': 1}",2

At CES 2018 this year, Samsung didn't have too many announcements that I found exciting. However, they did announce one breakthrough technology called ""Micro LED"" to be used in TVs. This could potentially have all the benefits of OLED, without the downsides. The TV they showed off using this technology was called ""The Wall"" TV, probably because of how big it is, at 146 inches. The rest of what Samsung had to show was not that interesting to me personally, such as smart fridges, and they had almost zero computer tech like they did last year.

Paolo was lucky enough to capture a fast fireball falling to Earth over the Atlantic Ocean, off the South Africa west coast -- look closely between 00:07 and 00:08 seconds at upper right in this video.

A fireball is basically a very bright meteoroid -- a small bit of natural “space rock” -- entering Earth’s atmosphere and burning brighter than the background stars. This particular meteoroid was moving much faster than typical, with an estimated speed of around 40 km/s, according to experts working on near-Earth objects (NEOs) in ESA's Space Situational Awareness Programme. 

""This speed is actually quite fast for meteoroids, which typically enter the atmosphere at around 20 km/s,"" says Rüdiger Jehn, SSA NEO segment co-manager.

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

I am out of school (and that hasn't quite settled in yet). This morning I attended the mandatory studio clean up session, and was there for 3 hours doing rigorous cleaning of the dye lab and it was tedious and gross. And lonely.

But I am here now! Believe it or not... I still want to make a room tour? I am in love with my space, and just thinking about having to leave and never being able to be back here again makes me sad. It also makes me immensely grateful for the ability to have occupied this space, even if it were just a little while. I want to film my space to remember it, I love it very much. Look out for that next week, hopefully.

even though it is summer break now for many of us, I still have another school vlog coming? haha.. I have quite a lot of footage on hand for finals week, which is why I chose to split this one from that. A little bit overwhelmed by the deadlines I have to meet as well as moving out of here in 2 days time! so much going on.

For those who have seen on my instagram (@pyperbleu), I am in the process of adopting a furry friend, a life companion and the newest member of our family to be. I am suddenly thrilled to get everything set up, so we can bring them home!

Basically, what I have to do is move out of my dorm here, stay a few days at Tyler's place, and then move into my apartment because the lease starts at exactly the first of the month. I won't be going home to California until july! This summer is going to be so fun, I already know it is going to be over before I know it. But I will surely be documenting it so I can always look back, and share it with you too.

Thank you for being here with me through it all, it is incredible that there is this amazing community I can share my life with. It is because of you I am able to do what I do and love it. Thank you endlessly. Please take care and know how valuable you truly are, and do things for nobody but yourself! I will see you soon.

Best,
Annabelle

Lyrics
Girl i know your more than just a number
i know when i look into your eyes
see i could love you more than any other
i know that you’ve been hurt i'll make it right

i know its hard to trust someone like me
when its my reputation thats first to speak
i won’t make a promise i can’t keep
cos i can give you something that you never had before

i just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
maybe i can mend your heart with mine
i just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
take you from a broken paradise
hit you like a wave girl an pull me under
don’t give me a chance to escape
i just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
take you from a broken paradise

i know everybody gave you warnings
i dont blame em, i dont trust my self
but this aint just like any other morning
and you aint just like any other girl

i know its hard to trust someone like me
when its my reputation thats first to speak
i won’t make a promise i can’t keep
cos i can give you something that you never had before

i just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
maybe i can mend your heart with mine
i just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
take you from a broken paradise
hit you like a wave girl an pull me under
don’t give me a chance to escape
i just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
take you from a broken paradise

So let me get this straight – THE GRAMMYS. POTENTIALLY CANCELLED? Like music’s biggest night? Those Grammys? I need to sit down…

That’s right – the award show we look forward to every year to find out which artist will be taking home the distinguished album of the year award and to watch our faves take the stage to perform in what is quite possibly the biggest night of their lives – has been given the ‘decline’ by some of music’s biggest names.

In past years, many celebs like Justin Bieber and Drake openly chose to skip out on the ceremony altogether because they felt like it doesn’t accurately represent talent and artistry, but a new report from Hits Daily Double was just released revealing that many other big names are joining in on the boycott.

Justin Timberlake has been releasing new music all month, along with his album release, set to drop February 2nd, but the news report claimed that he declined to perform or appear at the award show next weekend because he’s preparing for the Super Bowl Halftime Show. Ok, so valid excuse, but I should also mention that he’s had bad blood with the Recording Academy for years after reportedly feeling like they snubbed his previous 20/20 Experience album from a few major categories.

And don’t expect to hear any new Reputation performances or a soulful rendition of “Perfect” by Ed Sheeran, because Hits Daily Double is also stating that Taylor Swift, Lorde and Ed Sheeran have all “declined to appear” to the 2018 Grammys. Although Taylor’s Reputation album was ineligible due to its late release date, her first single off the record “Look What You Made Me Do” was completely shut out.

Same goes for Ed who likely won’t be attending because the Recording Academy kept him from some of the top categories to avoid another #GrammysSoWhite controversy, according to many sources. And then we lave Lorde, who may be the biggest performance snub of the year due to the fact that she was the ONLY female artist nominated for album of the year and wasn’t asked to perform. This allegedly made her team QUOTE, “extremely unhappy” to the point of boycotting the show altogether.

The news is definitely hitting hard for many who’ve been looking forward to seeing these names grace the stage come January 28th, but I do want to say that there are still many HUGE names set to take the stage next weekend, including Kendrick Lamar, Miley Cyrus, Sam Smith, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Cardi B, and many more, BUT right now I gotta know what you guys think about all this conundrum – do you think the award show will make an attempt to make amends come next year? Share all your thoughts down here in the comments, and then click right over here to get all the details on Cardi B’s first major movie role. Thanks for hanging out with me here on Clevver News, I’m your girl Joslyn Davis and I’ll see you next time.

This year for Thanksgiving I take a break from killing animals and explore what exactly it takes to make a completely vegan meat-substitute from scratch.  The tofu-turkey, aka Tofurkey, I make uses a combination of tofu, seitan and nutritional yeast, plus a cornbread stuffing.  I also tryout living by a vegan diet while working on this project, just for the full experience.

Special thanks to Yia Vang for his guidance with helping me make the tofu and tofurkey.  If you're in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, be sure to check out his pop-up restaurant Union Kitchen: http://www.unionkitchenmn.com

He'll be appearing in a ""Practical HTME"" video next week where he'll show you how to turn your tofu into a traditional Hmong dish!

3:07 China is one of the largest producers of fentanyl worldwide. VICE News follows the path of the dangerous drug as it moves to the U.S. and the effort to keep it from reaching the streets.

9:01 Brexit, and non-Brexit country, are on edge. Even pro-Brexit towns like Grimsby (70% Leave), are now clamouring to be an exception to any trade restrictions that might arise from leaving the Union. VICE News met the city’s crucial fish processing community that’s trying to take matters into its own hands.            

14:46 Postville has become synonymous with the militarized approach that the government now takes to immigration enforcement. And the effects of the raid are still being felt.   

19:26 The Department of Justice lost a fight this week to stop two undocumented teenage girls in detention facilities from having abortions.

22:22  New Orleans residents have been going to Fred Parker, aka Chocolate Santa for almost 40 years. Now 71, with bad knees and traveling via scooter, he's still making stops at local schools and his studio – where lines go down the block. VICE News visits Fred and his fans right before Christmas hits.

We heard some fun questions being answered by Natalia Tena who played Nymphadora Tonks, Stanislav Yanevski who played Viktor Krum, Bonnie Wright who played Ginny Weasley, and Oliver and James Phelps who played Fred and George Weasley. Then we saw the opening ceremonies on the Music Plaza Stage which concluded with the Orlando Philharmonic performing the music of Harry Potter live along side clips from the films. Then we headed over to Hogsmeade in the Wizarding World area of Islands of Adventure to see the all new Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle projection show. It was beautiful!  We'll have another vlog out tomorrow which will show more of the expo, merchandise and the studio tour!

Check out the awesome chisels I use here:
http://www.rockler.com/stanley-sweetheart-8-pc-socket-chisel-set

I wanted to try something new and decided to go with a wedged mortise and tenon joint...during the build I realized, that that would mean I could never take the bed apart in case i wanted to change something. so I left out the ""wedged"" part of the joint and simply went with a regular tenon for the looks. the joint are super snug but just to make extra sure nothing comes lose, i screwed everything together from the top through a 18mm birch plywood.
I still need to build a rail and better stairs.
The bed is secured into the metalframe of the trailer...it is super sturdy!

any cool ideas?

Mercedes-Benz has taken a completely new approach, revolutionising the compact class from the inside with a new feeling of spaciousness. The unique interior architecture is shaped in particular by the avant-garde design of the dashboard: for the first time a cowl above the cockpit has been completely dispensed with. As a result, the wing-shaped main body of the dashboard extends from one front door to the other with no visual discontinuity. The Widescreen display is completely free-standing. The air vents in a sporty turbine-look are another highlight.

The dashboard is divided into two three-dimensional, horizontal sections: the lower section is visually separated from the main body of the dashboard by a ""trench"", and it appears to float in front of the dashboard. The ambient lighting enhances this effect, accentuating the free-floating impression of the substructure. The 64 colours of the optional ambient lighting make five times as many colours available than before. And it is not just the variety that has increased, as the emotive presentation also sets standards in this segment: the different colours are composed into ten colour worlds to allow an avant-garde lighting display with spectacular colour changes.

The new A-Class is the first Mercedes-Benz model to feature the completely new multimedia system MBUX - Mercedes-Benz User Experience, which also ushers in a new era in Mercedes me connectivity. A unique feature of this system is its ability to learn thanks to artificial intelligence. MBUX can be individualised and adapts to suit the user. It thus creates an emotional connection between the vehicle, driver and passengers.

Queendom is about celebrating all the differences in us. It’s about celebrating the women and the children and animals and the men also. The quiet ones and the introverts, where they can sing and be seen. It’s about the shy people and the lonely people and I hope it can be a place where we can come and be lonely together and then not be lonely anymore. Queendom is a place for all of us.

On this episode of Dragon Tails, Coyote proves once again how formidable the bite of a common snapping turtle really can be when his finger gets snapped beneath the waters surface. YIKES.

Get ready and prepare yourself because IT’S A BAD BITE! 

*Please never attempt to catch or handle wild snapping turtles. Their bite can cause massive tissue damage and potentially the loss of appendages. This video should prove as a reminder why it is always wise to view wildlife from a respectful and safe distance.

It's Warriors vs. Cavs yet again. Of course. Can't have anything interesting happen at the end of the day.

In this video Tod talks about the Colletière à Charavines light hunting bow, one of a very few surviving European crossbows from this period (around 1000AD). This is a very simple bow with only a few components. It could be constructed with European woods such as ash and yew and basic hand tools by any ""back woods bodger""

How do you get closure?




But of course that phantom message never found it’s way to me - and why would it? We were awful together, so why would we magically work well apart? And that’s the obvious part about closure that movies tend to leave out: if you were dating the kind of person who goes out of their way to exercise self insight, compassion and empathy so that you could heal - chance are you probably wouldn’t have split up in the first place. Closure has this reputation for being a team sport but in reality it isn’t usually accomplished by holding hands, it’s most often done with clenched fists as you fight off the addiction and search for meaning.

So, because you can’t always get it from them - let’s work on it together. Are you ready to let go? Close your eyes and remember. 

Remember that feeling in your stomach on that date

Remember the way they made you feel small in big rooms

Remember that inspirational quote that you read over and over wishing it felt like home rather than hope on your lips, 

Remember the look that never felt right, the touch that always kinda rubbed you the wrong way - remember that yes nothing worth having comes easy but having someone worth loving is not supposed to be THAT hard.

I loved you. I do not understand you. Have a nice life.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wX2l7YFZMt4/sddefault.jpg,0.05290028045271785,0.0004583450566804927,115.4158415841584,0.0025004764973361533,0.053358625509398336,0.055859102006734496,2018-02-25,15:30:01,Sunday,6,11,38,11,27,63,206,1,28,0,2,9,2,4,15,5.0,4.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.714729501269432,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'bowl': 1, 'person': 2}",3

FAQs

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, and that is sophdoesnails, where I do loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! I do the occasional nail video on here but they are difficult to film.
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? I am 20
-What is your hair colour? 
Grey: Makki Hair colouring mask in Grey mixed with loads of conditioner.

LYRICS:
Give me your misery, all of it give it to me
I can hold onto it for you, it’s not a problem
I just want your energy, a piece of that fractured mountain
I’ll take whatever comes with it as long as it’s yours
All I know is that I want it more than yesterday
If I was waiting, I was waiting for just one little spark
You are the brightest I’ve seen
You are the best side of me
And just for when we’re apart
I’ve got a piece of your heart
But I want the whole damn thing
I feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too
Seeing forever this downcast blade from the sky
Could never sever through, not what we have me and you
Burning together and burning forever
I don’t know, I just can feel it in the atmosphere
If I’m wandering, I’ve wandered into just the right spot
You are the fire in my sleep
You are the reason I dream
And just for when we’re apart
I’ve got a piece of your heart
Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore
The years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die
But we’ll get by
And it goes on forever just like this
If I could go back, I would do it all over with you again

There's a reason mashed potatoes regularly sit in the number one spot on the list of America's favorite Thanksgiving side dishes — they're somehow creamy and fluffy at the same time, delectably buttery, and happen to provide the perfect vehicle for gravy. But great potatoes shouldn't be reserved for one day a year. Whether it's a huge holiday feast or just a weekday dinner with the kids, you want to put your best foot forward when it comes to this beloved side dish. Here's how…

Liftoff occurred at 4:14 p.m. EDT and Bangabandhu Satellite-1 was deployed into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) approximately 33 minutes after launch.

The Bangabandhu Satellite-1 mission served as the first flight of Falcon 9 Block 5, the final substantial upgrade to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Falcon 9 Block 5 is designed to be capable of 10 or more flights with very limited refurbishment as SpaceX continues to strive for rapid reusability and extremely high reliability. Following stage separation, SpaceX successfully landed Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship in the Atlantic Ocean.

In this video, we talk about my strategy for taking notes with the iPad and Apple Pencil. I use an iPad Pro but would probably recommend the new 2018 iPad with Apple Pencil if you're buying a new one. We talk about the benefits of taking notes with an iPad vs traditional methods, we talk about Notability vs OneNote (I prefer Notability), and I share various techniques of note-taking that I use in lectures, seminars and hospital placements.

In this video you can see how I capture a flyby of the ISS (International Space Station) in the night sky through my Telescope. For a detailed image I use a DSLR and for a trail picture I use the App NightCap on my mobile phone.

""Left To Right"" Lyrics:

(Hook)
she told them other boys step aside

from the moment she caught my eye

Let me set the scene up
dance floor in between us
DJ got us geeked up
I know everybody seen her

She stuck around when her crew left
I feel like it's up to me what we do next yeah

(Pre)

They let you Do Stuff(tm), and you can even convert your entire social life to be run entirely via Google's servers! WOW!

Well, according to a recent investigation by the Tucker Carlson clan, it turns out Google is hoovering up far more data than previously thought.

So, I finally decided to take the plunge: I've switched to a DUMBPHONE, and I've never been happier.

You can watch the Tucker Carlson Tonight video here:

https://www.facebook.com/TuckerCarlsonTonight/videos/585398735128783/

It turns out that your phone is vacuuming up data - including barometric pressure, if you're on foot or in a car, and precise location data - even when the phone has no SIM card and is in airplane mode.

Well, we knew it was bad... But not THAT bad!

Even airplane mode won't save you...

I spent nearly 2 years not going out and just saving everything I had and we both scraped our savings together to buy this home, we landscaped both the front and back gardens, rennovated the kitchen and bathroom, skimmed the ceilings in every room to remove the artex ceilings throughout the whole house and fitted spotlights throughout, We completely re-carpeted and painted to create the best space we could on the budget we had at the time and it is by far one of our biggest achievements.
I am so glad that we bought when we did as it brought us closer together whilst also proving an amazing investment.

But now we are getting ready for the next chapter.

Der liebenswerte Bär Paddington mit Schlapphut und Dufflecoat hat nicht nur bei Familie Brown ein Zuhause gefunden, er ist auch in der Nachbarschaft ein geschätztes Mitglied: Höflich, zuvorkommend und immer fröhlich - außerdem lieben alle seine Marmeladenbrote, ohne die er nie das Haus verlässt. Als der 100. Geburtstag von Tante Lucy ansteht, sucht Paddington nach einem geeigneten Geschenk. Fündig wird er im Antiquitäten-Laden des liebenswerten Mr. Gruber, das allerlei Schätze birgt: 

Ein einzigartiges Pop-up-Bilderbuch hat es Paddington angetan. Allerdings muss der kleine, tollpatschige Bär dafür ein paar Nebenjobs antreten - das Chaos ist vorprogrammiert. Und dann wird das Buch auch noch gestohlen! Paddington und die Browns setzen sich auf die Spuren des Diebs, der ein Meister der Verkleidung zu sein scheint ...

1) ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ is Like a Gangster Movie, Paul Bettany Says

2) ‘Bright’ Sequel Already Ordered At Netflix

3) Opening This Week – Downsizing, Father Figures

4) Judi Dench, Josh Gad Cast in Kenneth Branagh’s ‘Artemis Fowl’ Adaptation

5) Original Shape Actor Playing Michael Myers in ‘Halloween’ 2018

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

With The Last Jedi currently in theatres, Star Wars fans are now wondering about the next entry from a Galaxy Far, Far Away: Solo: A Star Wars Story. While the production problems alone have given fans something to talk about, not a single plot element has been revealed, other than it will feature everyone’s favorite scruffy looking nerf-herder Han Solo and his walking carpet companion, Chewbacca. But if actor Paul Bettany is to be believed, it looks as though Solo will break new ground by being a sort of “gangster film” set inside the Star Wars Universe.

According to a report from Bloomberg, Netflix is looking to continue taking on the big studios in fantasy franchises by setting up a sequel to the yet to be streamed Bright. Will Smith has already signed on for the sequel, but there is no word yet on who else will join him and who might direct. David Ayer helms the first installment that stars Smith alongside Joel Edgerton, Noomi Rapace, Lucy Fry, Edgar Ramirez, Ike Barinholtz and Kenneth Choi. It is set to debut this Friday, December 22nd.

OPENING THIS WEEK

Disney announced yesterday that Academy Award winner Judi Dench and Josh Gad have joined the cast of the live-action adaptation of Artemis Fowl, directed by Kenneth Branagh. Joining the cast as well is Irish newcomer Ferdia Shaw, who will make his onscreen debut in the title role.

According to Bloody Disgusting, the new Halloween movie written by Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, with Green directing for Blumhouse will be a true homage to the original that started it all. The site reports that the film has cast the original “Shape” actor Nick Castle as Michael Myers but since Castle is now 70 years old, stunt performer James Jude Courtney has also been cast to help complete the film.
