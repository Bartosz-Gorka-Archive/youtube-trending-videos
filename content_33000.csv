Khloe Kardashian told her followers on Snapchat that she’s got a pretty big fear regarding her pregnancy. She’s terrified that she’s about to get an outie belly button! “I have such a phobia with belly buttons, and I know when you’re really pregnant your innie becomes an outie,” she said in a short clip. Then, while flustered, she added, “Oh, my god, I can’t even think about that. I’m so grossed out by that. Ew.”

“The next US presidential election is a smidge less than three years away, yet just about everyone is wondering who the Democrats could rally behind to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. So far, senator Bernie Sanders is in the lead, according to PredictIt, a political prediction stock market.

Candidates begin laying the groundwork for a presidential run years in advance—the beginning of the next campaign seemingly begins when the last one ends. And Trump, an unconventional Republican whose time in office has been beset by turmoil (paywall), has inspired a sense of urgency among those who oppose him. Even so, no clear leader for the Democratic party has emerged since the end of Barack Obama’s second term and Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016.”

After getting my 20” turbine wheels from EV Wheel Direct something just wasn’t right about the look of Tez, my Model 3. So I called up my friends at Unplugged Performance and they let me know about a new set of suspension which lowers the car 1.5” (moderate) and also should improve the ride comfort.

## View My Results - https://teslanomics.co/improving-model-3-suspension-lowering-possible

Here are the full details on the springs themselves which retail for $335 w/o installation

Full details here - https://unpluggedperformance.com/product/model-3-dual-rate-lowering-springs

// Concept

This ambitious engineering project began with a review of factory spring rates and led to a goal of the following:
1. Target an increase in comfort in daily driving situations. Solution by studying factory spring rates and producing a softer but proportionate spring rate front and rear.
2. Target an increase in performance when cornering. Solution by utilizing the highest technology partner and producing a secondary more sporty performance spring rate that engages when cornering g forces are loaded.
3. Target an increase in range. Achieved by lowering the car as height is proven to correlate to aerodynamic efficiency.
4. Every day improved performance at significant value. Solution by producing in bulk volume in a direct manufacturer partnership produced to proprietary Unplugged Performance developed specifications.

// SPECIFICATIONS:

* Produced in an engineering partnership with Formula 1 and 50+ consecutive Indy car winning spring supplier HYPERCO
* Proven Dual Rate spring technology allows for best of both worlds. The car rides at noticeably softer spring rates around town. When sporty handling is desired, natural cornering g forces activate the spring’s 30% sportier secondary spring rate which reduces body roll and gives noticeable difference in both feel and handling at the limit
* Physics proven benefits of range efficiency by lowering center of gravity and reducing underbody air turbulence
* Three unique offerings – Mild provides near factory ground clearance and softest ride. Moderate provides a ground clearance equivalence to modern sports cars. Low provides a ground clearance equivalence to modern hypercars. Mild is approximately 0.7″ drop, Moderate is approximately a 1.5” drop, Low is approximately a 2.1” drop
* Designed, Engineered and Produced in America

Lyrics:
LET ME BACK IT UP
TO THE START OF THE CLIMB
FACED WITH AN ARMY OF VIPERS AND LIONS

I HAD TO KEEP ON REACH UP
CUZ IT WAS MY TIME
TO TEAR DOWN THE KINGDOM
AND CALL OUT THE LIARS

GOT A JAIL ON MY HEART FROM THE PESSIMISTS
GOT THESE NAILS IN MY MOUTH FOR IMPRESSIONISTS
SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY ON A THERAPIST
COULDN’T FIX ME I ACCEPTED IT

GLADIATOR
GLADIATOR
PICKED A FIGHT WITH THE GODS
I’M THE GIANT SLAYER

BONE SHAKER
DOMINATOR
FREIGHT TRAIN, WRECKING BALL
I’M THE GLADIATOR

TELL ME WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU THINK YOU BELIEVE
CAUGHT IN A CROSS FIRE
TROUBLE AT SEA

EVERY SINGLE DAY
I FEEL THAT GOLD UNDERNEATH
I SEE THE LOCKED DOORS
BUT I GOT THE KEY

IMMA GIVE YOU SECOND JUST TO CATCH YOUR BREATH
CUZ I CAN SEE THAT YOUR HEART IS JUMPIN OUT YOUR CHEST
I KNOW YOU GAVE IT ALL CUZ I’VE ALREADY SEEN YOUR BEST
IT’S TIME YOU ACCEPT THIS

GLADIATOR
GLADIATOR
PICKED A FIGHT WITH THE GODS
I’M THE GIANT SLAYER

BONE SHAKER
DOMINATOR
FREIGHT TRAIN, WRECKING BALL
I’M THE GLADIATOR

I’VE GOT EVERY REASON TO FIGHT
I’VE GOT EVERY REASON TO FIGHT
HAVE YOU EVER SHAKEN HANDS
WITH THE DEVIL IN THE NIGHT?
I’VE GOT EVERY REASON TO FIGHT

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Tom Allom & Andy Sneap – production

You know that life isn't set
I lead the pack I ain't no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die cause there's no surrender

Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

You know the way that I feel
If you're with me you better hold on tighter
I'm only keeping it real
That's who I am, I'm just a non-stop fighter

Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave

Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

I'm chasing a dream as I go higher
I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
I'm living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender...

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote gets up close with a teeny tiny Owl!

Well a teeny-tiny ""Scops Owl"" to be more specific, and this isn’t just any ordinary owl folks… ""Tiny” as she is appropriately named is actually a foster parent for other owls at a sanctuary in South Africa called “The Caring Owl.” That’s right Tiny actually nurtures baby owlets who have lost their parents so they can grow and be rereleased back into the wild…how AWESOME is that?!

Primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   
“Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). Peyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage.

I was overwhelmed by the amount of emails and messages I received in response. I didn't want the conversation to end there, so I decided to start a podcast where I invited others to share their experiences. It was a huge success, so for series two I wanted to progress things and film it too. So every Tuesday at 5pm I'll be uploading the video footage from the podcast here... I guess that makes it a vidcast, but let's not get too technical. 

The series will be a collection of frank and warm conversations with  high-profile mums and dads. We'll be discussing all aspects of parenthood  - the highs, the lows, the challenges and rewards. There is no such thing as the perfect parent. Instead, we’re all simply doing our best. It’s time to stop comparing ourselves and champion each other instead. Each episode will be truly unique yet unifying. No topic is out of bounds, and I hope the podcast and supporting video will be essential viewing for any parent seeking solidarity and support.

A huge thank you to Fisher-Price for sponsoring both the podcast and these videos, who celebrates a child’s uniqueness and encourages parents to just, let kids be kids!

A multi-platinum singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Hunter Hayes is a forerunner in today’s country music scene. With the breakout success of his self-titled, debut album Hunter Hayes, Hunter quickly carved out his place on the country music charts and awards landscape with hits like “Wanted”, “I Want Crazy”, “Everybody’s Got Somebody but Me (featuring Jason Mraz)”, and “Storm Warning”. His next album Storyline, featuring hit songs “Invisible” and “Tattoo”, and The 21 Project, a multi-genre window into Hunter's creative mind, further cemented his growing legacy. Following the release of the critically acclaimed tracks “Dear God” and “One Shot” in 2018, Hunter is back with his new single “Heartbreak”, ready to forge new musical roads and add to that legacy.

BAKU - For over a week, anti-government demonstrations have emerged across Iran. At this point, protests have been reported in dozens of cities, with at least 20 people confirmed dead in sporadic clashes between protestors and law enforcement units. In the Iranian capital, more than 450 people have been detained. Yet, despite the media hype, the unrest does not bear the signs of a revolution.

It's known officially as a ""Suite With Whirlpool Bath"" and it's about twice the size of a regular balcony cabin!  We loved having our own Jacuzzi on the balcony, and we spent a lot of time in it.

In this video, I explain what is so special (and so unusual) about the 28 cabins on the MSC Seaside that feature a Jacuzzi tub on the balcony...  and give you some advice on how to pick the best one of the 28 cabins, depending on what's more important to you:  privacy, or peace & quiet.

I also show you the surprising way that this cabin can transform from a great cabin for a romantic couple in to an excellent cabin for the whole family.

Most of this video was shot with a GoPro Hero 6 mounted on an image stabilizing gimbal...  in order to reduce camera shakiness and provide professional looking video.

Copyright Surrey NanoSystems.

► WHAT IS VANTABLACK? - Vantablack is not a black paint, pigment or fabric, but is instead a functionalised ‘forest’ of millions upon millions of incredibly small tubes made of carbon, or carbon nanotubes. 

Each nanotube in the vantablack forest has a diameter of around 20 nanometres (that’s about 3,500 times smaller than the diameter of the average human hair), and are typically from around 14 microns to 50 microns long. A surface area of 1 cm2 would contain around 1,000 million nanotubes

► HOW DARK IS IT? - Vantablack has been recognized by Guinness World Records as the World’s Darkest Man-made Substance. It is the darkest material ever measured by the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK, reflecting only 0.036% of the light that strikes it (measured at 700nm).

The goal was simple. To try meditate every day for 30 days and to see what benefits I might get in my life. I really enjoyed this challenge. 

I began meditating by using a variety of different apps, specifically Muse, Headspace, Calm and 1 Giant Mind. They all were similar but had their own, slightly unique spin on what meditation is and how to practice meditation. I found that Headspace was the app that seemed to mesh best with my personal tastes.  I focused on using that app for the remainder of the month.

Initially, I found meditation to be very challenging. My mind was very active and I constantly experienced a plethora of ideas flowing around inside my mind.  I’d start thinking about my business and its next hire, it’s clients, that book I wanted to read, what I need to eat, what I need to prepare for the gym and so on. Ideas were flying through my mind, and I found it really hard to just stop and go no, this is my time to meditate…

I need to count each inhale and exhale, and focus on my breath to take away from all the thoughts running through my mind.

Gradually, I began to see improvements. Particularly through the feedback given by the Muse Headband and the Headspace app. I developed a better understanding of what was meant by genuinely being aware of your thoughts. Foregoing detailed attention to the hyperactive part of my brain. It got to a point where thoughts would flow over me, similar to the waves on the surface of the ocean. I became comfortable just watching these thoughts, from below, flow over me, helping me become even more present.

Personally, I started to notice some benefits almost immediately.

I started to feel stronger and more focused at the gym, resulting in me being able to lift more weight in each exercise.  My mind wouldn’t wander in the middle of a task, whether it be work or something more personal. I was very aware of being more present. Perhaps the most beneficial thing for me was the improvement in my sleep. I was able to fall asleep quicker by shutting off my active thoughts and I became more relaxed in bed. Compared to how restless I was prior to the challenge.

I continued to track my results for the remainder of the month and was super happy with my progression. When I started, the Muse headband showed that I really struggled to calm myself for 5 minutes. Over 30 days, however, I was able to consistently achieve 10 minutes sessions wherein I was calm for 85% of the time.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience and something that I’ve continued following the challenge. I’ve begun to make it into a daily practice where I spent 10 minutes isolated and in alignment with my thoughts. I would urge you all to give it a go.  The rewards reaped from the amount of time spent calming yourself, are phenomenal.

Music is the sound of culture, and everywhere you go in the USA you’ll hear the energy of real places overflowing with local personality. From guitar licks to banjo picks, from brass horns to thumping bass, music opens the door to amazing discoveries around every corner.
With this in mind, we asked five musicians from different cities to reimagine one classic American song -- “Do You Wanna Dance?” by Bobby Freeman -- each in their own unique style.
Here we experience San Juan, Puerto Rico through the music of Calma Carmona. Native to Puerto Rico, Calma is known as the “soul songstress.” Bringing depth and a unique sound to each song, she enchants listeners with every word of her romance-filled lyrics.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

Movie Mistakes Animators Made Without Getting Caught! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

We all love animated films right? They’re not only fun but full of memorable characters and most importantly, breathtaking animations.They help take us to new worlds or to see our world in a different light. But despite the attention to detail that goes into them, mistakes still happen. Take Disney’s Frozen, which has it’s fair share of mistakes but the one we’re talking about this time focuses on a certain snowman named Marshmallow. Other Disney and Pixar films have made mistakes, such as Finding Dory, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and Moana. They all look gorgeous but still have something that draws us out a bit. But it’s not all Disney and it’s not all for kids. Batman: The Killing Joke is definitely not for kids but still remains one of the most talked about and polarizing films of that year. One animation mistake can be found during one such scene that divided fans. Other films include the return of Spongebob Squarepants to the big screen and of course, the Minions, who are always up to no good it seems. Luckily for them, this mistake actually has nothing to do with them specifically so they’re off the hook this time. The Peanuts Movie saw the return of Charlie Brown and Snoopy to the big screen yet despite it’s unique and charming animation style, was also the victim of some animation mistakes. Cars 3 raced into cinemas so we looked back at the first Cars, which had an usual cow tipping scene which caused the film one of its biggest mistakes.

From Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television, A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE! is inspired by the holiday classic feature “A Christmas Story” and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway production “A Christmas Story: The Musical.” Marc Platt (“Grease: Live,” “La La Land,” “Wicked”) and Adam Siegel (“Grease: Live”) will executive-produce, with Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary (“Grease: Live,” “Anything but Love,” “Ira & Abby”) serving as co-executive producers and writers. Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “La La Land”) who composed the original score to “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” will compose several new songs for the LIVE television event on FOX.

Two-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick (“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “The Producers,” “Manchester by the Sea”) will star as the narrator where he will play the grown-up “Ralphie Parker,” who looks back with love and humor on his favorite childhood Christmas. Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker."" Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.

 These inhabited stories are predicated on an underlying value system (as we must want to be where we are going more than we value where we are).

 In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing on our current frame), and determine emotional significance (positive: things that move us along; negative: things that get in our way).

Joining Bateman and McAdams in the cast are Billy Magnussen (“Bridge of Spies,” TV’s “American Crime Story”), Sharon Horgan (Amazon’s “Catastrophe”), Lamorne Morris (TV’s “New Girl”), Kylie Bunbury (TV’s “Pitch,” “Under the Dome”), Jesse Plemons (“Black Mass,” TV’s “Fargo”), Chelsea Pereti (TV’s “Brookyn Nine-Nine”), Danny Huston (“Wonder Woman,” “X-Men Origins: Wolverine”), with Michael C. Hall (TV’s “Dexter” and “Six Feet Under”) and Kyle Chandler (“Manchester by the Sea,” TV’s “Bloodline”).

Bateman and McAdams star as Max and Annie, whose weekly couples game night gets kicked up a notch when Max’s charismatic brother, Brooks (Chandler), arranges a murder mystery party, complete with fake thugs and faux federal agents. So when Brooks gets kidnapped, it’s all part of the game…right?  But as the six uber-competitive gamers set out to solve the case and win, they begin to discover that neither this “game”—nor Brooks—are what they seem to be.  Over the course of one chaotic night, the friends find themselves increasingly in over their heads as each twist leads to another unexpected turn.  With no rules, no points, and no idea who all the players are, this could turn out to be the most fun they’ve ever had…or game over.

“Game Night” is written by Mark Perez (“Accepted”).  John Davis (“Joy”), John Fox (TV’s “The Blacklist”), Jason Bateman and Jim Garavente (“Bad Words”) are producing, with Marc S. Fischer serving as executive producer.
The behind-the-scenes team includes director of photography Barry Peterson (“Central Intelligence,” “We’re the Millers”), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” “Apollo 13”), editors Jamie Gross (“Vacation”), Gregory Plotkin (“Get Out”) and David Egan (“Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return”), and costume designer Debra McGuire (“Vacation,” “Ted”).
The film will be released worldwide beginning March 2, 2018.

“Game Night” is a New Line Cinema presentation and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment company.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hit hard, cause a scandal
Can't stop, I'm hard to handle
Don't care if my halo dips
My rise to this is worth the risk
Run fast, put up a champion
One chance to make it happen
Don't care if my halo dips
My rise to this is worth the risk

[Pre-Chorus]
Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work for the dollar, dollar
Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work

[Chorus]
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world

[Post-Chorus]
I got fight, I got heart
I got the strength to tear it apart
I got bite, I got brains
I got the grace and power to reign

[Verse 2]
I run, run the high road
I'm back taking my throne
I know the patriarch don't fit the part
What I'm gonna start
See now, I'm the wild one
I stole the bones of Brando
I know the patriarch don't fit the part
What I'm gonna start

[Pre-Chorus]
Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work for the dollar, dollar
Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work

[Chorus]
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world

[Post-Chorus]
I got fight, I got heart
I got the strength to tear it apart
I got bite, I got brains
I got the grace and power to reign

[Bridge]
Eh, eh
Eh, eh
Eh, eh
Eh, eh

[Chorus]
It's a girl gang
Those boys, they wish they could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
And boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world

[Post-Chorus]
I got fight, I got heart
I got the strength to tear it apart
I got bite, I got brains
I got the grace and power to reign

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

Approximately 90 kilometres in length and running through more that 20 municipalities the Tramuntana are actually pretty hard to miss and being a UNESCO World Heritage Site only adds to their allure.

Starting in the picturesque Port de Pollença I was keen to find out more. The island is such a hotspot for professional and amateur cyclists seeking winter sun, continually growing in popularity since I first visited over 20 years ago.

To be honest I wasn't too sure where I'd end up, but then that's half the fun isn't it? What I did know is that we'd be tackling Mallorca's highest road pass, up to the Túnel de Monnàber that cuts through the famous Puig Major (Mallorca's highest peak at 1,445m) followed by the longest descent on the island, 14 kilometres of sweeping bends and smooth road all the way down to Soller. Anything more than that is a bonus, so let's ride!

Start: Port de Pollença
Length: 82.7 km
Highest point: 850m
Start Elevation: 0m
Elevation Gain: 1,536m
Max Gradient 10%

月曜日／amazarashi
作詞・作曲：秋田ひろむ

体育倉庫のカビたウレタンの匂い
コートラインは僕らを　明確に区分する
渡り廊下で鳩が死んでた　いつもより余所行きな　教科書の芥川

支柱に縛られた街路樹　まるで見せしめの磔
好きに枝を伸ばしたいのに　同じ制服窮屈そうに
右向け右で左見て　前ならえで列に背を向け
救いなのだその幼さが　君だけは大人にならないで　

月曜日、蹴飛ばしたら　ゴミ箱にも嫌われて　転がって潮風に錆びた
息苦しいのは　ここが生きる場所ではないから
僕ら地球外生命かもね
好きなこと好きって言うの　こんなに難しかったっけ　それならば僕は息を止めて潜るよ
君の胸の内の深さには　遠く遠く及ばないとしても

駅ビルのコンコース　待ちぼうけ
ソフトクリーム溶けた　全音符のクラクション
近寄る度　多くを知る　知らないことは多いと　河川から望む学区外

明日の話はとにかく嫌い　将来の話はもっと嫌い
「儚いから綺麗」とか言った　花火が永遠ならよかった
見えてるものを見えない振り　知ってることを知らない振り
いつの間にそんなに大人びて笑うようになったのさ

月曜日、蹴飛ばしたら　川の水面で水切り　満月を真っ二つ切り裂いた
胸が苦しいのは　互いに思うことが伝わるから
僕ら超能力者かもね
嫌なこと嫌って言うの　そんなに自分勝手かな　それならば僕は息を止めて潜るよ
君の胸の内の深さには　遠く遠く及ばないとしても

普通にも当たり前にもなれなかった僕らは　せめて特別な人間になりたかった
特別な人間にもなれなかった僕らは　せめて認め合う人間が必要だった
それが君で　おそらく僕で　ゴミ箱にだって　あぶれた僕らで
僕にとって君は　とっくの昔に　特別になってしまったんだよ

月曜日、蹴飛ばしたら　大気圏で焼け落ちて　僕の胸に空いたクレーター
確かに似た者同士だったけれど
僕ら同じ人間ではないもんな
一番怖いのはさよなら　それなら約束しよう　永遠に別れはないと

Intro:
If I were to list off channels that served as motivation for my YouTube career, Channel Awesome, and most notably, Doug Walker aka. The Nostalgia Critic was one of them.

Every Tuesday night, I grab a takeaway and pull up my laptop, and watch his latest review in an almost ritualistic manner, that habit has continued until today, even though I’m not unconditionally in love with his content, it’s hard to deny that they’ve brought me gems like Sharkboy and Lavagirl that had me chuckling for days following, and I don’t laugh at much, so for someone as emotionally soulless as me, to have that sort of content to at least entertain the vacuum was meaningful, and I’ve learned a lot about cinema and the standards surrounding it through the indirect messages often portrayed in their episodes.

I found out about The Nostalgia Critic through ThatGuyWithTheGlasses, I can’t exactly say how that happened, we’re talking about approximately 2011 when I discovered their content, so bringing specifics into my memory is a challenge to say the least, though I will say that I also discovered two other critics, ToddInTheShadows and The Rap Critic in quick succession, although I’m not certain which order, but much alike to the NC, they are two critics whom I still watch to this day.

I’m not going to enter too much depth as I assume it’s a story you already know by now, but ThatGuyWithTheGlasses was set up by a partnership between Doug Walker and a few people we’ll get to in a moment, this was done in light of the very stringent copyright rules regarding YouTube and a situation regarding his series of 5 second movies, this is covered in a nice article that I’ll link below, now whether that’s fair use or not, is very subjective, it’s the sort of comedic cutting that came into contention earlier last year with Sargon of Akkad and Akilah Obviously, but either way, hosting videos on Blip and using their domain as a way to embed their content, they decided it would be reasonable to host a numerous selection of creators. But wait a minute I hear you say, who are “they”, well Doug Walker, we’ve already introduced, his brother, Rob Walker, and a third individual named Mike Michaud. The two other individuals were Mike Ellis, and Bhargav Dronamraju, the latter of which there isn’t too much to say, and the former whom we’ll address later.

Now, if you’re thinking to yourself, “huh, I’ve never heard of him”, don’t worry, I hadn’t heard of him until a couple days back when I coincidentally found myself on their Wikipedia page briefly before the document in question was released. I remember thinking to myself “I’ve never heard of this bloke, what does he do?”, well, things, he does things, things that we’ll address very soon.

I was having a discussion with Quinton Reviews over this a couple weeks before the documents were released, we had both noted how many creators had left abruptly and seemingly with little notice, we’d wondered about the explanations for such decisions, well, on April the second, after rumbles of activity, we received their full side of the story.

The document itself is a seventy page condemnation of Channel Awesome, and their questionable behaviour and incidents that resulted due to it, now I’m someone who always look into such claims with an element of scepticism, it’s an integral part of my philosophy, because if I didn’t then I think that such an approach could be easily exploited by people with malintent, although I do completely comprehend that it’s a tender subject.

Even with that said, the sheer number of corroborating testimonies and accounts makes it hard to dispute, saying any of it is false at all is a push, they persuaded me over the benefit of the doubt line for Channel Awesome. I’ve read all seventy pages, and it’s convincing content.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

1) Star Wars The Last Jedi Rolling Stone article: will the saga continue after Ep 9 and will Carrie Fisher’s death be addressed?

2) Disney’s Live-Action ‘Mulan’ Casts Liu Yifei in Title Role

3) Opening this week – The Shape of Water 

4) New Trailer for ‘All the Money in the World’ Features Christopher Plummer’s J. Paul Getty

5) First trailer release for ‘Mary Magdalene’ starring Rooney Mara

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

In an extensive report from Rolling Stone, more details about the future of the Skywalker Saga including how Episode 9 will deal with the General Leia character and whether or not the Skywalker Saga will end after Episode 9 was touched upon ahead of the December 15th release of The Last Jedi.  One of the bigger questions to start is will the Skywalker Saga continue after Episode 9? According to the director, JJ Abrams confirmed he does see the Saga ending after Episode 9 but cautioned that the future is “in flux.” 

THR reports that Disney’s world-wide search is over and Mulan has been found. The trade reports that Chinese actress Liu Yifei, also known as Crystal Liu, is set to star as Mulan in Disney's live-action adaptation of the classic Chinese tale. A team of casting directors for Disney visited five continents, seeing nearly 1,000 candidates for the role, which required martial arts skills, the ability to speak English.

OPENING THIS WEEK 

BUY OR SELL

A new trailer has been released for All the Money in the World, but this time – it features the added scenes of Christopher Plummer in the role of J Paul Getty, previously played by Kevin Spacey before he was removed entirely from the movie after allegations of harassment. 

The first trailer for Mary Magdalene has officially been released online. Starring Rooney Mara as Mary and Joaquin Phoenix as Jesus, the movie is the directorial follow-up from Lion helmer Garth Davis, and is set in the Holy Land in the first century C.E. where a young woman leaves her small fishing village and traditional family behind to join a radical new social movement led by Jesus of Nazareth.

INGREDIENTS
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, sliced
¾ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup dry white wine
1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
Kosher salt
1 pound spaghetti
2 pounds mussels, scrubbed, debearded
2 pounds large shrimp, peeled, deveined
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Lemon wedges (for serving)

RECIPE PREPARATION
Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until golden and softened, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and garlic is softened, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly darkened in color and starts sticking to bottom of pan, about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring often, until the smell of the alcohol is almost completely gone, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes and juices, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until sauce thickens slightly, 8–10 minutes. Taste and season sauce with salt.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.
Add mussels, shrimp, and ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce. Cover and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until mussels open, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, pick out shrimp and mussels and transfer to a large bowl, discarding any mussels that have not opened. Loosely cover with foil to keep warm.
Add pasta and another ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce and stir to coat. Reduce heat to medium, add butter, and continue to cook, stirring and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, return shrimp and mussels to pot, and carefully toss to combine. Mix in parsley and lemon juice.
Transfer pasta to a platter and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fssih_SHlYE/sddefault.jpg,0.013097747566376921,0.0002368489614173041,55.3,0.0006631770919684518,0.013334596527794227,0.013997773619762677,2018-02-01,09:35:00,Thursday,3,8,38,8,33,45,334,0,79,0,1,7,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,"['ata', 'OW', 'Rader', 'rr ia', '', 'al']","['ata', 'OW', 'Rader', 'rr', 'ia', 'al']",True,"['ata', 'OW', 'rader', 'rr', 'ia', 'al']",6,6,16,0,1,0,0,6.340432902628943,1,['surprised'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"{'cell phone': 1, 'tie': 1, 'car': 1, 'person': 1}",4

20 MINUTES OF BRAND NEW GAMEPLAY! NEW ISLAND, NEW DINOSAUR! | Jurassic World: Evolution Gameplay

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

NORWAY LOCATIONS SHOWN: Lofoten, Nustjord, Flakstad, Ramberg, Bidge to Torvoya, Ytresand Beach, Björnsand, Mærvollspollen, Unstad, Grunnførfjorden sandbanks, Henningsvær, Vikjorden, Lødingen, Rørvikstranda, Straumen. Filmed by Stefan Zimmerman on the DJI Phantom 4 Pro Drone. 

ABOUT THE MUSIC: ""This production is a continuous mix of three ambient works, each work featuring a different Hatfield sister :) The first song features Erin Hatfield on vocals, and later on a beautiful sounding hang drum provides some rhythmic backing, then featuring a vocal solo by Erin Hatfield around the 10:00 mark. The second song is a remix from my game, Pixelsphere. The third song features Ashley Hatfield. Ashley's vocals are washed in reverb and linger as chord swells in the background which are combined with a boy's choir sound. My wife Julie Hatfield's lovely vocals are featured in all three songs. Big thanks to the vocalists Erin, Ashley and Julie for helping me with this composition!"" ~Alex Smith. MUSIC NOTES: This ambient score features a very unique instrument: the hang drum. From Alex: ""They are pretty cool and organic sounding kind of like a steel drum that you hold in your hand, with the exception that the instrument itself is a specific type of resonator so it the way it rings after it's struck with your palm.""

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday and Friday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

In this episode of On Location, Coyote is getting the chance to meet face-to-face with the man he considers to be the “Godfather of Sting”, entomologist Justin Schmidt.  

Justin has successfully been stung by more than 80 insects species, which in turn allowed him to create the world famous Insect Sting Pain Index.  It is this very index that became Coyote’s roadmap for all of the painful stings he has endured over the past 2 years on the Brave Wilderness Channel.

In this exclusive interview Coyote and Justin will talk about their painful experiences in the world of stinging insects and will ultimately land at a very interesting crossroads.  Is the infamous bullet ant really the most painful sting in the world?  Or is it possible…that an even more potent sting is yet to be discovered…?

Get ready to learn about the Origins of Sting!  

If you enjoyed this look into the Origin of Stings check out the documentary INSECTA featuring Coyote and Justin! - http://bit.ly/insectadoc

Back in action with a new series, and we’re breaking down the Sandwich! Sandwiches have been a large part of my culinary world for most of my life but I’m excited to go deeper than ever before. I’ll be exploring the true art form of the sandwich, by searching for the best sandwiches this world has to offer, learning what truly makes them so special and then showing you how to create them 100 percent from scratch. I’ve gone so many incredible sandwiches already rumbling through my brain that I want to explore, but please comment in below with any suggestions that you would like to see me create! Stay tuned, things are about to get wild in the sandwich game…

OK, this is exciting and scary. So, while I wait for the time at which we are all coordinated for this thing to go live let me tell you how this worked.

First, the designer got the manuscript, then they read it, then they sent me three sample covers that I did not like. They were obviously rough mockups, but I didn't like the direction. There was good energy, but all of the fonts were hand-written and, honestly, I wanted it to look visibly distinct from a John Green book.

So then I sent them a few things:
1. Three images that I really liked that were not book covers. They all had bold colors, repeating patterns, and felt illustrated but now hand-drawn.

2. A few of my favorite recent book covers.

3. A few lines, less than 400 words about what I really hoped for that included this sentence: ""Getting the mix between high energy and fun and deadly serious is something I thought a lot about when writing, and it's hard, but it may be an impossible thing to hope for in a cover design.""

Then a few weeks went by during which time I was assured that a lot of time and thought were going into sending a long a more finished product that took my thoughts into account. I feel very lucky that I got to have this much feedback.

What I then got in my email was five designs...three of which were color variations on the final product. And I was like, ""YES! THIS!"" but then of course I had some thoughts. I asked for some other color treatments, and I also suggested adding the eyes to one of the Carls, which I think is a very cool touch. In the end, I went with one of the original color schemes but was glad I had seen the others anyway. And with a couple of very very minor finishing thoughts we had it.

I have a lot more thoughts on covers and I could critique great design all day, but I only had four minutes. I feel bad that there are so many great covers out there (and on my bookshelf right now) that I didn't get to talk about, but there are only so many minutes in a vlogbrothers video and only so many hours in a day!

Thanks everybody, I hope you like it!

In today's Practice Notes 59, I share ways to practice arpeggios that I believe are effective and efficient.  Although this video is very piano specific, there are some concepts that can translate over to other instruments as well.  These points of conscious practicing really helped me improve my piano technique over the years.

The two pieces of music I use to demonstrate these practice methods is Chopin's Etude Op. 10 No. 1 and Exercise 8A from my Modified Chopin Exercises book.

Black Mirror is widely loved, but it's also horrifying to watch. So what makes it so compelling, and is it more than a critique of technology?

OK. A thing I didn't say, that I probably should have, is that we haven't actually had a chance to do as much research on marijuana as we should have. Edibles have different effects than smoking which has different effects from vaping. Different strains have different amounts of THC and CBD and that matters. These are both psycho-active compounds and they both have effects on your brain. That's why they get you high, but the highs are different and the effects (and thus potential negative side-effects are different.)

But it's also very hard to even STUDY marijuana because it's illegal...so this is both another reason to decriminalize (to make research easier) and a reason why it's more complicated (we don't know for sure how many of the negative effects we've teased out.

THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VIDEO WHICH INSPIRED THE ""50 MUMS/50 KIDS"" VIRAL VIDEO!

Here's a great song for any TWILIGHT fans - Christina Perri's beautiful song -  'A Thousand Years'.  

Tracy is currently recovering from a shoulder operation, so Suzanne is doing a bit of Carpool karaoke signing here with her daughter Ella (this is one of Ella's favourite songs).  Ella turned 18 last year so the lyrics in this songs are also quite poignant for Suzanne as Ella enters the next chapter of her life as a young adult! 

Here are the #Makaton signs we chose to put into this song - enjoy!

The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe.

The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the centre of the Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in a galaxy we call the Milky Way, which is one of hundreds of billions (perhaps trillions[which?]) of galaxies in the Universe. Many of these stars have planets. At the largest scale galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then, and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an action role-playing game developed by Warhorse Studios and published by Deep Silver for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. It is set in the medieval Kingdom of Bohemia, an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire, with a focus on historically accurate and realistic content. It was released worldwide on 13 February 2018.

The story takes place in 1403, as war wracks Bohemia. On the orders of Hungarian king Sigismund, Cuman mercenaries raid the mining village of Skalitz, a major source of silver. One of the survivors of that massacre is Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Destitute and vengeful, Henry joins the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who leads a resistance movement against Sigismund's invasion. As Henry pursues justice for his murdered family, he becomes involved in an effort to restore Bohemia's rightful king and Sigismund's half-brother, Wenceslaus IV, to the throne.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a single-player experience with branching quest lines and a interactive world encouraging emergent gameplay. It features period-accurate armors and clothing, combat techniques, and real-world castles recreated with the assistance of architects and historians.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fydScv7aZc4/sddefault.jpg,0.029085134970074512,0.0011237327470379874,25.88260869565217,0.006209844876022963,0.030208867717112495,0.036418712593135456,2018-02-20,14:34:58,Tuesday,1,11,63,11,46,73,500,4,76,0,0,8,0,1,4,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.680043052767407,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

About Generation Wealth:
For the past 25 years acclaimed photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield (The Queen of Versailles, Thin, kids+money, #likeagirl) has travelled the world, documenting with ethnographic precision and an artist’s sensitivity a vast range of cultural movements and moments. Yet, after so much seeking and searching, she realized that much of her work pointed at one uniting phenomenon: wealth culture. With her new film, Generation Wealth, she puts the pieces of her life’s work together for in an incendiary investigation into the pathologies that have created the richest society the world has ever seen. Spanning consumerism, beauty, gender, body commodification, aging and more, Greenfield has created a comprehensive cautionary tale about a culture heading straight for the cliff’s edge. Generation Wealth, simultaneously a deeply personal journey, rigorous historical essay, and raucously entertaining expose, bears witness to the global boom-bust economy, the corrupted American Dream and the human costs of capitalism, narcissism and greed.

Casey Neistat, of course, does the same on a regular basis. As always, I'm enjoying making these storytelling breakdowns to figure out how to vlog better. 

SECRET CUTS
So if you've come to here to see just what I ended up cutting from the video, I appreciate you so much. You're awesome! Anyway, cut to the chase. 1)Guitar: You'll find me running around with the guitar at about the 1 minute mark. And I was going to connect Jack Conte as a musician, with how varying shots is similar to how melodies are a sequence of variation of tones. I really digged the analogy, but ultimately decided it bogged down the video so I cut it. 2) The other one is Alfred Hitchcock on my screen at about 2:30. I had a whole explanation about what a Mcguffin is. It's a film term that is related to the whole having an item/thing drive a narrative. But again, the video worked better without it, so again it was cut. Haha, anyway, thanks again for watching the video!

Video Features: We usually see breed lists either related to dogs or cats but rarely see lists of other creatures.  And today when i saw a bizarre chicken, I thought it would be great to bring something different on 4 Ever Green for its awesome audience. So I researched and collected information about some of the most interesting chicken breeds that exist on our planet. So
Here we present the list of most beautiful and bizarre chickens you won't believe actually exist.

Official Anabolic Aliens video of: Sugar Amounts Exposed In Popular Hydration Drinks! 

Sugar is one of the top leading causes to being overweight/obese. It directly correlates to weight gain, abdominal obesity, decreased HDL which is your good cholesterol and increased LDL which is your bad cholesterol, as well as high triglycerides, blood pressure, blood sugar, and uric acid levels. By consuming too much sugar resulting in these conditions, your risk for obesity, diabetes, and even heart disease significantly increases. Not to mention how bad too much sugar is for your oral health. It can be detrimental to your teeth and gums. In this video I showcase popular drinks I see people drinking at the gym or at sporting events to stay hydrated exposing their sugary truth! I compare Gatorade, Powerade, VitaminWater, Vitamin1, VitaCoco, BodyArmor, Snapple Lemon Tea, and Nantucket Nectar.

Watch this brave little dog’s amazing recovery and transformation. Anna was saved by Howl Of A Dog organization from a city pound in Romania. She was severely emaciated and required emergency care. The medical investigations and blood tests performed revealed a very long list of affections triggered by the lack of food. She was anemic and dehydrated, lost significant muscle mass and body fat and the level of proteins in her blood was very low. The little food she was eating was actually consumed by the internal parasites from her digestive tract, leaving her even weaker. Her already fragile body was all covered in fleas causing constant itching and scratching. She was also diagnosed with mange and ear infections and had scars on her ears, legs and an infected wound on the tail.
She was put on antibiotics and received intravenous glucose and amino acids and the medicated baths helped her get rid of parasites and mange.
Anna has made a beautiful recovery and now needs her own loving home.
She is a cheerful dog full of joy, very loving with everyone, enjoying every cuddle and attention she receives. She gets along great with all dogs, and with cats as well
Anna is a young dog estimated to be around 2-3 years old, medium sized, weighing now 17 kg (37 lbs). She is fully vaccinated, microchipped and ready to go to her own loving home.
Anna is in our care in Romania, but we also facilitate international adoptions. To adopt her please check our adoption procedure here: www.howlofadog.org/adoption-procedure. Thank you!

UPDATE: Anna was adopted and she now lives in a beautiful town in New York state: https://bit.ly/2K49XLM

Thanks for all of your support. This wouldn’t have been possible without you all. Homework EP out now! 

I can’t seem to stop myself from writing big piano ballads. Sorry/Not Sorry. Wrote this with my brother Chuck. When the party’s all over and you think it’s all done- this is a song that says, hey, I’ll be there for you.

The Day That The Dance Is Over Lyrics:
They’re cleaning up the confetti. It’s an empty room. Plastic cups in the corner. Many times you have carried me higher up than I could reach, but this time you’re on my shoulders. And while there’s something to talk about, and while there’s something to say: I promise you, Iwon’t be gone on the day that the dance is over- I will be your song. Keep holding on. On the day that the dance is over I will be your song.
 
You can put away your costume. You can be yourself. There is nothing to be scared of. They can turn all the lights out, leave us standing in the dark, but I’m not going anywhere, love. And while there’s something to talk about, and while there’s something to say: I promise you, Iwon’t be gone on the day that the dance is over- I will be your song. Keep holding on. On the day that the dance is over I will be your song.
 
I know the party is over, I know that all good things must end. But I believe there is music in the silence. And while there’s something to talk about, and while there’s something to say: I promise you, I won’t be gone on the day that the dance is over- I will be your song. Keep holding on. On the day that the dance is over I will be your song.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g1eqq-W-bI0/sddefault.jpg,0.03892563959512234,0.00019128078425121543,203.5,0.0029170319598310354,0.03911692037937355,0.04203395233920459,2017-12-15,05:10:21,Friday,4,12,53,11,22,62,345,3,40,0,1,11,51,5,11,4.0,6.0,"['darren ¢', '', 'omework ep the day that the dance is over']","['darren', '¢', 'omework', 'ep', 'the', 'day', 'that', 'the', 'dance', 'is', 'over']",True,"['darren', '¢', 'omework', 'ep', 'the', 'day', 'that', 'the', 'danc', 'is', 'over']",11,10,39,0,0,0,5,4.50462647262544,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

She explains why you may not like the sound of your own voice on recordings, the differences between your outward, inward and inner voices -- and the extraordinary things you communicate without being aware of it.

Is there anyone out there who doesn’t love Ellen Degeneres? This hilarious, outspoken talk show host is beloved by tons of fans, but not by everyone. Even some people who appeared on The Ellen Degeneres Show could barely contain their dislike of Ellen. Wendy Williams is constantly competing with Ellen for daytime ratings, and that might just explain their awkward encounter on television. Priyanka Chopra and Ellen started out having great banter, until Priyanka inadvertently insulted Ellen with an offhand comment. Giada De Laurentiis was supposed to teach Ellen and Nicole Kidman how to cook, but she spent more time mocking their dishes than instructing. Jennifer Lawrence not only managed to insult Ellen with her anti-LGBT comments, but many fans as well. Gospel singer Kim Burrell’s comments made Ellen cringe so badly that she uninvited her from appearing on her show as a musical guest.

We could be going back to Hawkins, Indiana sooner than we thought. 

The second season of Stranger Things has been out for almost a month, and we or may not already be re-watching it. Stranger Things 2 was everything we were hoping for and more, even the infamous seventh episode with spoiler alert Eleven’s sister.

We don’t want to admit how fast we watched the whole season, but let’s just say that we didn’t sleep until it was finished. As much as we love being able to watch the whole season at once, there’s something somewhat disappointing about not having a new episode to watch every week which makes the wait in between seasons even more unbearable.

Although the second season literally just came out, we’re already thinking ahead and wondering how they’re going to answer all of our questions and tie up loose ends. We haven’t been given an official confirmation that we’re getting a Stranger Things 3, but with the second season bringing in over 15 million streams, Netflix would be insane to not continue the show that became an overnight success when it debuted last year.

Last night Stranger Things stars Finn Wolfhard, AKA Mike Wheeler, and Linnea Berthelsen, AKA Kali, along with show creatives attended the Vulture Festival’s Stranger Things: Inside the Upside Down. The panel was all about the second season and answering some of the fans’ most burning questions. 

While talking about how thankful they are for the amazing response to the new season, the Duffer Brothers, the brains who created the show, accidentally let it slip that they were already working on season three! 

Ross Duffer said QUOTE “We are in very early days on season three and we’ re still figuring it out.”

He quickly realized his mistake and continued on to say QUOTE “I probably wasn’t supposed to say that… That’s not official, that wasn’t an official announcement — we’re just working on it, just for our own amusement…for fun!”

Obviously everyone began to freak out over this admittance and even Finn tried to help by saying QUOTE “Maybe if you guys like it, there will be a third season!”

Besides an announcement from Netflix, this is the best confirmation we could have ever gotten about Stranger Things’ future. 

Are you guys so excited about what’s to come for Stranger Things and what is your favorite moment from season two? Let us know in the comments below. I’m Drew Dorsey, thanks for tuning in!

So... I watched Davie504's video this morning about the impossible bassline claimed by the famous DJ Deadmau5 -  Strobe(Sparkee Nudisco remix) and I thought it would be fun to do a little bass challenge :)

The background is that Deadmau5 was listening to Sparkee's remix of ""Strobe"" and said that the bassline of that remix was ""technically impossible"" and he would love to see a bass player play that part live...

My fellow bass friends try out this impossible bassline; then record a version of this, upload it to youtube  and put the link in the comment box below :D I would love to watch different versions of this impossible bassline played by different bass players :P

Now, a 50th anniversary Mustang BULLITT revives that legend. With an upgraded 5.0-litre V8 engine, available Dark Highland Green paint and ultra-modern, performance inspired interior, this is a car destined to become an icon of its own.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Bob Sackett - There was talk of a live action Jonny Quest movie with Robert Rodriguez to direct, any idea or word on this project? Thanks.

Jessica Ritter - I was just wondering if you had a chance to see the new poster for Ocean’s 8? I think it looks and sounds wonderful. The cast is great and I love these kinds of films. What do you think of the poster and what are the odds the film turns out well?

Karan K - Hey John, love the show I wanted to know what does Disney buying fox mean for the gambit,x-force,and the orient express sequel that were already greenlight by fox?

Joshua Nyberg - John, I absolutely love your content. With both jumanji and the greatest showman opening in theaters next week which do you think will have a better opening in terms of revenue. Also do either of them stand a chance to lead the box office in revenue or will that honor belong to TLJ on its second weekend? Thanks.

David Browning - Hi John, been a fan since AMC days and love you’re a fellow supporter of Man of Steel. Now with JL, you say you’re a fan but I watched you rant about how WB should reboot. I think this shows how little you actually believe in them. Why say you like something but also want it to change just because your friends don’t like it and why reboot after establishing a universe, which has huge potential?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8q0zF2pclQ/hqdefault.jpg,0.03337024051177954,0.0019068708863874022,17.5,0.006335732299932337,0.035277111398166944,0.04161284369809928,2017-12-15,19:11:37,Friday,4,13,21,13,21,74,168,1,50,0,0,12,15,2,0,5.0,7.0,"['(A | ee', 'AE', '', ' ', '', '5', '=', 'an', 'ag', 'a', '=', '=n,', 'oi', '=', '=', 'o', '—', 'uo', '=', '', 'WARS', 'A LUT TTT']","['(A', '|', 'ee', 'AE', '5', '=', 'an', 'ag', 'a', '=', '=n,', 'oi', '=', '=', 'o', '—', 'uo', '=', 'WARS', 'A', 'LUT', 'TTT']",True,"['(', 'A', '|', 'ee', 'AE', '5', '=', 'an', 'ag', 'a', '=', '=n', ',', 'oi', '=', '=', 'o', '—', 'uo', '=', 'war', 'A', 'lut', 'ttt']",24,19,37,8,3,2,5,6.183950771019349,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

About Damon and Jo:

We just finished up 12 weeks of pregnancy.  It's crazy to think we are 3 months along and finishing up our the first trimester.  We let work know, announced on social media that we are expecting and had our second ultrasound!  Busy week for us, and the highlight was seeing our little baby roll over!

A breakdown of some products I love so far and links to our other videos are below : )

But a recent video taken in the Simpson Desert has highlighted how bad the insects have been as of late.

When Andrew Harper from the Outback Camel Company was travelling through the western Simpson Desert in the last couple of weeks the number of flies he saw shocked him.

The cameleer said he had never seen the flies this bad in his 22 years traversing the outback, which is why he subsequently took a video of them, racking-up hundreds of thousands of views on social media.

""The flies have been atrocious to say the least,"" Mr Harper said.

""We all had fly nets on and we stopped for a break. I was looking back at my lead camel and her saddle and the front of the saddle. Right across both sides was just black.

""There must have been hundreds of thousands of them. Worst I've ever seen for bush flies at this time of year.""

Mr Harper said he never usually wears a fly net, but this trip it was a must. Along with a mosquito net at night for sleeping too.

""We would time it in the morning, about half an hour before sunrise. The swarm would arrive and on go the fly veils.""

Mr Harper said naturally he, and the rest of the crew, swallowed quite a few flies, whereas the camels were not too bothered by the influx.

Where do the flies come from?
Mr Harper said the flies were high in numbers because of recent rainfall and high temperatures.

""We had good rain up here in March and we're working on a desert fringe cattle station at the moment,"" he said.

""So the cattle follow the feed, the flies follow the cattle, and of course flies need cattle poo.

""With the extended warmer temperatures their life cycle is thriving.""

Mr Harper said the flies live for about a month and they were looking for moisture.

The female flies were looking for protein.

""There's about three females to every male in bush flies and they need protein to reproduce,"" he said.

Nearly 4,000 US flights were cancelled on Thursday as snow blanketed parts of the north-eastern US seaboard as well as eastern Canada.
Boston could get up to 18in (45cm) of snow while rough waters have already triggered coastal floods in the region.
The storm, known as a ""bomb cyclone"", is expected to continue to affect eastern North America into the weekend.
After the snowfall ends, temperatures are expected to plunge as frigid air lingering over the North Pole heads towards the US mid-Atlantic region.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

lyrics:

(verse 1)
i need emotion novocaine
i need a numbing of my brain
i need something 
to take away 
the remains of ur name

i need amnesia for a day
& an umbrella for the rain
that hasn't gone away
since u said u didn't need me

lately, 
been thinking maybe
there's a place we
won't feel so crazy

then in a hazy
mid-morning daydream
i found a shady
spot that they saved me

they said

(hook)
come be the newest member of 
the broken hearts club
we hate every little thing
about the people that we loved
we’re the let down, we’re the lied to
where the lost go
when it finds u
where the lonely,
make the lonely,
feel less lonely
& we’re dying to
invite u to stay
& take away the pain
cuz misery loves company 
so hey, what do u say?

(verse 2)
& at first i wasn't sure
if there's even a cure
for what i'm feeling cuz what i'm feeling’s
been feeling more & more absurd
the repeating in my head
of every last word that u said
feels like ever since u left
u still won't leave me

& lately, 
been thinkin maybe
there might be a place we
won't feel so crazy

for changing 
the way u made me
& in a daydream,
i let them save me

(hook)
i'm the newest member of 
the broken hearts club
we hate every little thing
about the people that we loved
we're the let down, we're the lied to
where the lost go
when it finds u
where the lonely,
make the lonely,
feel less lonely 
& we’re dying to
invite u to stay
& take away the pain
cuz misery loves company 
so hey, what do u say?

(bridge)
i guess
if u can't beat 'em join 'em
that's what they always say
let's go inside, let's coincide, 
& all commiserate

singing

(hook)
we're the newest members
of the broken hearts club
we still feel pretty lonely 
& we wish we didn't but
we're the newest of 
the broken hearts club
& we all kinda hate it
but it's easier than love
singing
we're the newest members
of the broken hearts club
& we still feel pretty lonely 
& we wish we didn't but
we're the newest of 
the broken hearts club
& we all kinda hate it
but it's easier than love

ABOUT PARKS AND RECREATION
From Emmy Award-winning executive producers Greg Daniels (NBC’s “The Office,” “King of the Hill”) and Michael Schur (NBC’s “The Office,” “Saturday Night Live”), “Parks and Recreation” is a hilarious ensemble comedy that follows Leslie Knope (Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Amy Poehler, NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” “Baby Mama”), a mid-level bureaucrat in the Parks and Recreation Department of Pawnee, Indiana, and her tireless efforts to make her quintessentially American town just a little bit more fun.

People like the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones pay $1 million annually for personal coaching, thousands of fans pay $650-$3,000 to participate in intense events like ""Unleash the Power Within,"" and millions around the world have bought his books and tapes.

Last September, the eight winners of Shopify's Build a Bigger Business competition were flown to Robbins' Fiji resort Namale for both group and private coaching sessions with him. We had a chance to observe his roughly 30-minute one-on-one sessions with the winners, including the entrepreneur he personally selected from entrants, Lively founder Michelle Cordeiro Grant.

The sessions offered a rare look at how Robbins is quickly able to assess a person's pain points, both personal and professional, and leave them with insights both practical and powerful.

Just Why?

Alright what's going on guys it's Trev back again here to bring you another video.  In this one we will be giving our thoughts on just why they decided to kill off Carl Grimes in the walking dead.

It was gimples decision, not Chandlers. There is a interview with chandler and he stated that “I have no clue to be honest, when Scott told me, that was his decision”. Beyond pissed at Gimple right now. - Justin Patton

Q&A: It has to be the actor. If AMC truly decided to kill Carl off at this point, for shock value or ratings or whatever, then that would be the biggest misstep the show has ever made. The past 8 seasons have been about Rick trying to build a world for his kids. Sure, there have been characters in between, but the main story is Rick and his family. Do you think that either way, either Chandler wanting off or AMC doing it, it is going to adversely affect everything in the show and everyone in the group? And do you think it will put a spice in the ratings, only to dwindle because people will boycott the show because of his death? Would love to hear your thoughts. I personally feel like it was a really bad idea, and might cause a spark for a bit, but will in the end harm the show. - J Morris

they f'd up one of the best characters of all time - 
Andre E 

Q&A: How many episodes will Carl live? Just the premiere, or maybe another episode or two? How long could they draw it out for? - J Morris

I almost was brought to tears seeing Ricks face when we saw Carl was bit, we see Rick doing everything for Carl since season 1 and Carl dies just like that - Andrew Ortiz

People are maaaad! I’m just going to watch to see where it goes from now on. Who else is counting the days until Fear The Walking Dead season 4? - Brianna Salo 

Time for people to act like they were always a fan of Carl, so they have another reason to complain about the show. - Platinum Pop

Hey trev Question, what if, and WHAT IF, Carl’s immune, I don’t wanna sound like some stupid ass fan but I just don’t see how the hell they would kill Carl like that, it’s too lackluster and I guess I’m in denial but I still love twd just a thought - PopsPlays

he got bitten last episode he said it happen saving the guy - 
Willywhitsonreactions 

As always, thanks for watching everyone!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gFeeAayWYB0/sddefault.jpg,0.008968339954255448,0.00021818947875285903,41.10344827586207,0.0003761887564704466,0.009186529433008309,0.009562718189478752,2017-11-17,09:35:00,Friday,4,11,38,11,33,63,334,3,79,0,1,9,14,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.172746056321379,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

When most people think of foreclosure, they think of people who can’t afford to pay off their mortgages.

But in Detroit, it’s often the result of people struggling to pay their property taxes. One big reason is that, in the years after the Great Recession, the city went bankrupt and failed to lower property assessments far enough to account for the impact of the housing crisis. While the value of residents’ homes fell, their taxes remained inordinately high, and tens of thousands of people fell so far behind on their inflated tax bills that the county seized their homes and sold them off at annual auctions.

In recent years, the city and county have lowered assessments and offered reduced interest rates to some homeowners. But they have no plans to stop punishing those who were overcharged in the past.

VICE News followed this year’s tax foreclosure auction and investigated how the county financially benefits from the process. As Detroit touts its comeback and celebrates its success in climbing out of the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, many of the city’s residents remain on the brink of displacement.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST and on Thursdays at 5pm EST I do LIVE STREAMS!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

I’ll be honest, the strangest thing about this Giant Stack of Waffles Cake is the fact that we’ve haven’t done them sooner! You guys have been requesting this cake for AGES, but with the recent release of Stranger Things Season 2, I thought it would be the PERFECT opportunity to cake Eleven’s fave food up a notch! To make my GIANT Stack of Waffles Cake, I baked two round pans of moist & fluffy Vanilla Cake, whipped up a batch of butter-coloured buttercream, piled it in scoops on top of my fondant-covered waffle cakes, and drizzled the entire creation in real Canadian maple syrup and Hershey’s Kisses!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

90 million years ago, an ancient snake known as Najash had...legs. It is by no means the only snake to have limbs either. But what’s even stranger: we’re not at all sure where it came from.

A Fifth Harmony member just dropped a new Christmas medley duet and your ears about to be blessed.

Christmas came a little early when Dinah Jane and Leona Lewis dropped their Christmas medley duet yesterday.

If there’s one thing we know about Fifth Harmony, it’s that these girls can SING. Ever since their time on The X-Factor, the girl group has been improving and topping the charts with their songs, and now they’re branching out and doing their own side-hustle.
Lauren Jauregui just released a collab with Steve Aoki and now Dinah Jane is joining in on the fun. Yesterday the 20-year-old singer took to Twitter to announce her new collaboration in the sweetest way possible. In a series of emotional tweets, Dinah talked about how she grew up inspired by female artists like Leona Lewis, Beyonce and Carrie Underwood and how she sang Leona Lewis’s song “Yesterday” for her first ever YouTube cover.

Dinah then went on to say that she always dreamed of singing with Leona but never thought it was possible until she saw that Leona favorited a fan’s tweet that said the two needed to work together. Dinah saw that as an opportunity and took it, which is how we ended up with one of our new favorite Christmas songs.

In the medley, Dinah and Leona sing some of the most classic holiday tunes and it truly sounds like angels singing. As if getting this incredible duet wasn’t good enough, they also released the CUTEST music video that has our Christmas cheer going through the roof.

Leona even surprises Dinah with a framed photo of the two of them and it brought Dinah to tears! We may or may not have teared up, too.

We don’t know about you, but this song is getting added to our Christmas playlist ASAP.

Are you dying over this collaboration and what’s your favorite Christmas song featured in the medley? Let us know in the comments below! I’m your host Naz Perez, thanks for tuning in.

And click to the left to hear all about Camila Cabello’s two brand new songs! Thanks again to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring today’s episode. Xfinity Mobile is a new kind of network designed to save you money.

However according to Mikhail Varshavski, also known as the social media star ""Doctor Mike"", we have too many people who believe they know it all -- also referred to as ""I Know All"" (IKA) experts. In his passionate talk, Doctor Mike asks us to celebrate doctors who are self-aware and say ""I don't know"". He also draws the importance on asking the right questions and being aware of medical research limitations and conclusions. Dr. Mikhail Varshavski D.O., is a New York-based doctor focusing on family and preventative medicine. Better known as ""Doctor Mike"", he is a social media entrepreneur, philanthropist, and a doctor with purpose, stressing the importance of preventative medicine by highlighting his experiences through his unique journey. Doctor Mike started documenting his medical journey through his popular social media platforms to motivate students to pursue their medical training. Doctor Mike graduated from the New York Institute of Technology in 2014 with a B.S in Life Sciences and a Doctorate in Osteopathic Medicine via an accelerated 7-year track. On June 30, 2017, he completed his 3-year Family Medicine Residency at the Atlantic Health System-Overlook Medical Center in Summit, NJ. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I came up with an idea and wanted to see if I could make it, which is a bit of a departure for most of my projects. The bench is made of solid walnut and ash. It's dimensions are 40"" long, 20"" tall, and 12.5"" deep. Surprisingly it is not uncomfortable to sit on.

I didn't glue the base to the squiggle because I want to revisit a better base design in the future. One thing I realized would save a lot of time is starting from the middle and working my way out; this would let me attach two pieces at a time and really cut down on the time waiting for glue to dry.

I think this method for creating unorthodox shapes is pretty interesting. This shape in particular could make a nice coffee table by adding a piece of glass on the top.

If you have any questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments. I will do my best to answer them. Thanks for watching!

True to the spirit of everyone's favorite regenerating degenerate, Deadpool 2 doesn't hold back on the violence, profanity, and fourth-wall-breaks, taking everything great about the first movie and turning it up to 11. In that vein, Deadpool 2 also introduced a ton of new characters, and then...well, let's just say there are plenty of spoilers ahead.  Some of those new characters carry a lot of weight in the comics...and a few have even saved the world once or twice. Let's take a look at all the characters in Deadpool 2 who mean more than you realized…

It's our first night in Japan ever and we're staying at a CAPSULE HOTEL! The futuristic design gave me galaxy vibes. It felt like we were inside a spaceship floating among the stars.

The pods turned out to be more spacious than expected. I did not get claustrophobic, but everyone's level of comfort varies in enclosed spaces. How about the rest of the experience? Watch the full video to see the detailed tour!

Amphibian airplanes can be a relatively new concept even to pilots. That’s because most of us train in tricycle, land airplanes. But the fact is 70% of planet is covered by water so it only makes sense that we have airplanes that can land or float on water. Well we do, and today we are checking out 5 of the best light modern sea planes available in the industry.

Being that these aircraft are light, and many of them in the LSA category, you get limited amount space/useful load and you’re traveling no more than 120 miles per hour for the most part. Here are the airplanes listed:

1. Icon A5 - Arguably one of the most technologically advanced light plane built in the last 20 years. The Icon A5 stuck a chord with many old and new pilots, particularly those who want to fly just for fun or sport. The airplane is known for its good handling capabilities and anti-stall safety feature. But honestly there is no such thing as anti-stall for an airplane. Due to troubles and some failed promises over the years, the ICON initial goal to take over the sport aviation market has somewhat stalled. There are very few production airplanes flying today, and pilot/owners seem to be very happy with the product. Below are specs for the A5.

USEFUL LOAD: 430-550 lbs
RANGE: Up to 491 miles
SPEED: Up to 109 mph
PRICE: $269,000

2. Super Petrel LS - If you’re in the US, You probably haven’t heard about this amphibious plane. Me either, not until researching for this video. The Petrel is a French/Brazilian design and although popular around the world, its a bit quiet here in the United States. With all the cool features in the airplane though, which includes double wings, and a turbo charged engine upgrade, all for $175,000. Not bad, hopefully the company gets more love and coverage. Below are specs for the Super Petrel.

USEFUL LOAD: 537 lbs
RANGE: Up to 590 miles
SPEED: Up to 115 mph
PRICE: $175,000

3. Vickers Waves - An Icon A5 lookalike but much sleeker. This airplane is designed by founder and owner Paul Vicker from new Zealand. Lots of cool features including those folding wings also seen the Icon A5. But the Vicker is still in design phase. There is no flying prototype yet to confirm any performance numbers. Below are specs for the Vicker Waves.

USEFUL LOAD: 500 lbs
RANGE: Up to 828 miles
SPEED: Up to 138 mph
PRICE: $180,000

4. MVP - The name alone draws special attention. MVP is another light seaplane that flames to be the most practical of all. With this plane you can fly on land, water and snow. You can also take it fishing, camping and much more. Perfect airplane for the all the adventurous daredevils out there. Below are specs for the MVP.

USEFUL LOAD: 450 lbs
RANGE: N/A
SPEED: Up to 120 mph
PRICE: $189,000

5. Searey - Available in both light sport and experimental with your choice of engine, ranging from the Rotax 912, 914 or 915. The Searey airplane is hands down the best bank for the money. No it’s not the best looking plane when compared to the other sleeker ones like the A5 or the Vicker, but you get all the same feature and then some with the Searey. And a complete light aircraft will only cost you $125,000. Below are specs for the Searey.

USEFUL LOAD: 450 lbs
RANGE: Up to 416 miles
SPEED: Up to 120 mph
PRICE: $125,000

With 2018 just around the corner you know what that means. That’s right, movie award season is coming. In the lead up to all the red carpets and gossip it’s time for Hollywood to unleash the final wave of blockbusters in the hope of scoring a nomination. Of course, we here at TheRichest love movies. In fact, we can’t get enough of them - to the point that we create our own videos about movies. If you’ve followed us for any amount of time then you know that we love picking apart films. Even if they are our favorite, we love finding those goofs, mistakes and things that just don’t make sense. Then we put them all together and present them to you.

Icon. Artist. Legend. Edna Mode is back, dahlings. 

Disney/Pixar’s Incredibles 2 opens in theatres June 15!

In “Incredibles 2,” Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack—whose superpowers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don’t shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That’s what makes this family so Incredible.

Announcing Demi was tonight’s hilarious host Tracee Ellis Ross and the camera immediately cut to Demi sitting in the audience with a microphone looking stone cold as heck.

All of a sudden it cut to a ton of tweets from some Demi haters covering the stage screens.

She stood up and walked to the stage delivered a powerful message saying QUOTE, “There’s so much hate in this world. We have to rise above and never say sorry for who you are.”

And with her backup dancers in tow she broke out into Sorry Not Sorry looking boss in baggy black pants and what may or may not be a bedazzled bodysuit.

Whatever it was, she looked incredible sporting extra long, sleek black hair that was very reminiscent of prime Cher.

With amazing vocals, flashing red lights and an entire choir going wild in the best way possible behind her, this performance definitely stands out as one of Demi’s best.

BTS fans were especially stoked to see the boys get cut to in the crowd. Jungkook was definitely hype and having a great time while also munchin’ a snack.

Dancing and eating at the same time. Super relatable to be honest.

Earlier in the night she arrived at the carpet in a stunning black strapless dress with her date Danica Roem, the first openly transgender state legislator.

Dem told E! News QUOTE, “My story with ‘Sorry Not Sorry’ is about bullying and I wanted to have her in the audience with me tonight because I feel like we have been through some of the same things and now get to share this experience together.”

So what did you think of Demi’s statement performance? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below. I’m your host Ava Gordy, thanks for watching Clevver and I’ll see you next time.

Lyrics:
Verse 1:
Remind me where we used to go
We were dancing to the break of dawn
You took me high you took me low
We were dancing to the radio
Remind me where we used to go
We got lost in our favorite song
I never never wanna know 
If we ever ever let this go

Pre chorus:
All we had was love
You took me higher
Gave me that sweet, sweet fire
In the setting sun
The tide got higher
And we caught fire

Chorus:
We were dancing to the radio

Verse 2:
Remind me where we used to go
We were dancing to the beat of love
We took it high we took it slow
We were dancing to the radio
Remind me where used to go
We got lost in our favorite song
I never never wanna know
If we ever ever let this go

Pre chorus:
All we had was love
you took me higher
gave me that sweet sweet fire
In the setting sun
the tide got higher
and we caught fire

Chorus:
We were dancing to the radio

Outro:
Ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody like you

Because there ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody like you

There's no doubt that Gordon Ramsay is one of the biggest names in the restaurant industry. He's an international sensation whose multiple-Michelin-starred cooking chops have made him a household name. He's starred on several TV shows, and has restaurants all over the globe. He enjoys considerable success, but fame has a way of bringing on the haters — and Ramsay's got a lot of them. What is it about Ramsay that makes him so reviled? In some cases, his many feuds can probably be chalked up to professional jealousy, but it definitely goes further than that. Many people simply can't stand his personality, while others have found themselves as the target of one of Ramsay's cruel comments. Here are some of the people who can't stand Gordon Ramsay...

Yellow Highend Primer | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nij/
Yellow Corrector | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nih/
As I mentioned, the colour yellow neutralizes the color red in warm skin tones but can also be used for hiding purple or blue bruises veins, and under eye circles.

Purple, lavender, or lilac Primer | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8ni2/
Purple, lavender, or lilac Corrector | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nih/
The colour Purple, lavender, or lilac neutralizes unwanted yellow tones found on the skin and it's great for brightening.

Pink Primer | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8ni2/
Pink HIGHEND primer | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nik/
Pink Cream Corrector | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nhx/
Pink Liquid Corrector | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nih/
The colour pink is best for light skin tones that wish brightening around the eye area and masking signs of fatigue.

Orange CREAM Corrector | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nib/
Orange LIQUID Corrector | http://go.magik.ly/ml/8nih/
The colour Orange is best for darker skin tones that wish to hide dark circles or other spots with deep discolouration.

NOTE : When picking the corrector tone we have picked the opposite however you must consider the depth of corrector too (how light or dark it is) use the skin shade for reference, the light you are the pale the corrector, the darker you are the deeper the corrector.

Its soundtrack is a mix of 80s pop, classical compositions & songs by singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, including two songs written specifically for the film.

Listen to the full soundtrack: https://soundtracks.lnk.to/CallMeByYourName

While the soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a compilation of tracks by numerous musicians, Guadagnino decided he wanted to approach American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens to create a song especially for the film. “An artist for whom I have enormous admiration is Sufjan. His voice is fantastic and angelic, and his lyrics are so sharp and deep and full of sorrow and beauty. The music is so haunting. All these elements were the ones I wanted to envision in the film.”

While Guadagnino knew that Stevens had never collaborated on a movie before, he reached out. Stevens read the book, they had a long conversation, and the result was that he wrote not one, but two original songs for the film: “Mystery of Love” and “Visions of Gideon”. 

The soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME also includes tracks by John Adams and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as pieces written by Erik Satie, Maurice Ravel and Johann Sebastian Bach. As the film is set in the 1980s, Guadagnino chose period Italian pop music (including Giorgio Moroder & Joe Esposito’s “Lady Lady Lady”) for the radio, but particularly spotlights The Psychedelic Furs’ anthem “Love My Way”. “I love The Psychedelic Furs,” says Guadagnino. “It’s kind of autobiographical, because I remember listening to that song when I was seventeen and being completely affected by it. I wanted to pay homage to myself then.”

LYRICS 
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
'Til I breathe my last breath
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

The loss came only a week after the President made a very blatant attempt to woo voters in Pennsylvania by calling for heavy tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. Trump wants to focus on American made products and goods, so we wondered how things were going on his family website trumpstore.com. Jimmy ordered a bunch of stuff and it turns out, a lot of it isn’t even made in America.

The headline acts are the Ford GT, Lamborghini Huracán Performante and McLaren 720S. But that would be forgetting to mention a new Porsche 911 GT3, or its burliest rival yet, the Mercedes-AMG GT R. Then there’s the Volkswagen Up GTI, the most attainable GTI in a very long time. The Honda Civic Type R, quite possibly the most talented front-wheel-drive car ever. The first all-weather Mercedes E63. The hardcore BMW M4 CS. The slashily styled Lexus LC500. One of the most powerful roadsters on sale, the 602bhp Audi R8 Plus Spyder.

The day I've been waiting for has come! Tarte has added foundation to their ever amazing Shape Tape family! Woo Woo!!

Watch as I put the two formulas to the test and show a side by side comparison.

Now you guys know I love my shape tape and so I was THRILLED to receive these and have the opportunity to tell you guys my first thoughts.

I hope you all enjoy this review/first impression grwm, let me know if you'd like to see more:)

I'm going to leave more regarding my final thoughts on this foundation down below!

Hydrating Shape Tape:

Looks hydrating and gives a beautiful glow to the skin
Would recommend for Dry & Normal skin (could work for combo with additional setting threw the day)
Light-Medium Buildable coverage
Blends easily & didn't crease
Wouldn't recommend for long wear on Oily, combo skin types

*Cant comment on shade match as the shades sent were not correct for my skin tone. However, the undertones seemed off & I’m curious to see if they have my correct shade.

Matte Shape Tape:

Dry and patchy looking when first applied but improved with wear
Would recommend for Oily, Combo & normal skin Would hydrate well prior to applying on normal skin types and would NOT recommend for dry skin
Medium-Full Coverage
Would recommend for 5+ hours of wear

***One thing I hadn't realized was that the shade range is EXTREMELY limited for POC which is disappointing to see. Hopefully they will launch additional shades in the near future! *Update* 10 additional shades will be added. I feel this is a little too late as they should have waited to launch the collection as a whole.
The launch was poorly executed & extremely insensitive.***

Please feel free to ask any additional questions not answered above, below.

Species Profile : Tyrannosaurus Rex | Jurassic World Evolution

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

When a pregnant parishioner asks Reverend Toller to counsel her husband, a radical environmentalist, the clergyman finds himself plunged into his own tormented past, and equally despairing future, until he finds redemption in an act of grandiose violence. From writer-director Paul Schrader comes a gripping thriller about a crisis of faith that is at once personal, political and planetary. BUILD hosted Schrader, Ethan Hawke and Cedric ""The Entertainer"" Kyles as they discussed the new film, ""First Reformed.""

The clothes on the hangers were custom Off-White pieces designed by Virgil Abloh for Jenner’s night out at the Met Gala the following day. There was a cloud-like corseted top made with gauze fabric and a pair of high-waisted white trousers with trains at the hem of each pant leg. A pair of white lace gloves were the icing on this heavenly cake. “It’s so dope,” the Vogue cover girl explained once she slipped on the look and started posing in front of a full-length mirror.

Since the start of the Syrian civil war, Kurdish people in the North have carved out an autonomous region of their own — Rojava — by fighting the Islamic State. Their militias, which form the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have emerged as the most effective fighters against ISIS and won them a close partnership with the US. 

The ruling Kurdish Party, the PYD, has set up a democratic federation made of local governments. Their constitution claims to accept people of all ethnicities and religions and treat them as equals. One of its central tenets is equality of men and women. In fact, the all-female Women’s Protection Unit (YPJ) militia fights alongside the SDF, and they’re known to be especially good soldiers. 

But the more territory the Kurds take from ISIS, the more worried Turkey gets.

Turkey has been at war with another closely linked Kurdish group, the PKK, for decades. In 2018, Turkey invaded the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin, putting the country in direct conflict with the Kurds of Rojava. 

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

About Damon and Jo:

It’s Damon. It’s Jo. And It’s Damon and Jo. Ok so look, we got tired of all the boring, predictable lifestyle and travel content out there, so we took matters into our own hands and started filming our travels, and adventures around the globe, in 5+ languages.

They say that there are no new ideas in Hollywood. And to that, we say: good. After all, why waste time coming up with a bad new idea when you can just remake a classic, old, good idea? If something was a hit once, chances are it will be a hit again, which is why Hollywood is currently working on another slew of awesome reboots. Here's a look at some upcoming remakes that will get you pumped…

Lyrics: 

I wanna feel the same now
I wanna feel the same as when you stood next to me
Stood next to me
There was a time I knew how
There was a time I knew how sweet your kiss could be
Your kiss could be
I remember every smile
Every little smile and every ride just with you 
Ride just with You
If you stay a little while
I will find the place just for me and you 
Trust me, it’s true

Maybe you can‘t understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland
Go where we want to be
When we get there at night
Let’s stay there for a week
Just wanna feel so close to you

Baby please understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland
Go where we want to be
When we get there at night
Let’s stay there for a week
Just wanna feel so close to you

I wanna see that girl now
I wanna see the girl I saw on the crowded street 
On the crowded street 
There was a time you knew how 
There was a time you knew how to make my life complete
Make my life complete
Still remember every smile
Every little smile and every ride just with you 
Ride just with You
If you stay a little while
I will find the place just for me and you  
Trust me, it’s true

Maybe you can‘t understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland
Go where we want to be
When we get there at night
Let’s stay there for a week
Just wanna feel so close to you

Baby please understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland
Go where we want to be
When we get there at night
Let’s stay there for a week
Just wanna feel so close to you

But there is one glaring difference between these two men’s presidencies: Fox News.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Trump and Nixon are similar in a lot of ways: they both faced major FBI investigations, were accused of obstructing justice, lashed out at the media, and oozed raw sexual charisma. Some pundits look at those similarities and assert that, like Nixon, Trump will also face impeachment.

But Nixon never had Fox News. As trust in mainstream media has collapsed over the past 40 years, the amount of conservative media has exploded. And sources like Fox News have spent months casting doubt on the FBI and the Mueller special investigation.

Without a uniting narrative in the media, it’s unlikely Trump will face impeachment or that Republicans in Congress will be the ones to hold the president accountable for his actions, regardless of what Mueller ultimately finds.

On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump. Follow Carlos on Facebook for more: https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox

On the TV side, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Limited Series went to Nicole Kidman for her work in Big Little Lies. Nicole beat out fellow Big Little Lies stars Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon for the win, but it’s clear that those ladies have nothing but love and support for one another. It was Nicole’s first ever SAG award win, and she was visibly thrilled and humbled at the honor.

Outstanding performance by a male actor in a limited series went to Alexander Skarsgard for his work opposite Nicole Kidman in Big Little lies, so clearly those two should keep acting together because something’s definitely working.

When it came to the awards for best comedic performances in television, William H. Macy was honored for his work in Shameless, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus took home yet another award for her work in Veep. Seriously, that woman is unbeatable when it comes to acting awards in comedy. 

In the TV drama categories, Claire Foy won best actress for her turn as Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, and Sterling K. Brown took home the Actor for his work in This Is Us. Sterling made history by being the first African American male to receive the award in this category, and he gave an impassioned speech where he thanked his wife in a way that made her, and literally every person in the room and at home watching, completely melt.

I hope he gets all the awards forever because every time he gives a speech it’s the absolute best.

Speaking of This Is Us, the entire cast took home the award for best performance by an ensemble in a drama series, beating out the other amazing casts of Game of Thrones, The Crown, The Handmaid’s Tale, AND Stranger Things. Their collective reaction was of pure shock and delight, and Milo Ventimiglia gave a heartwarming and humble speech on behalf of the cast.

Last but not least in the TV categories, the best performance by an ensemble in a comedy series went to Veep. Julia unfortunately couldn’t attend the show to collect her awards because she just finished her last round of chemo for breast cancer, but she did hilariously tweet about the wins, writing QUOTE, “I wish I could have been @SAGawards tonight but have to admit it’s pretty fun to watch in my pj’s. So honored to win. So proud to be a union member. So happy for my @VeepHBO bozos for winning ensemble award. Miss being at the table with you all. How was the chicken?” 

Moving on to the film categories, Sam Rockwell took home the Actor for his supporting role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, meanwhile Allison Janney won for her supporting role in I, Tonya. 

Frances McDormand was honored with the award for Outstanding Performance by a leading actress, also for her incredible work in Three Billboards. It was also a big night for veteran actor Gary Oldman, who won his first Actor EVER for his leading performance as Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour. 

The Actor for outstanding performance by an ensemble went to the cast of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, and considering it also won Golden Globes for Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Best Motion Picture Drama, it’s definitely shaping up to be a huge Oscar contender. 

Alright guys that’s our winners recap, now I wanna know which actors and actresses were you most excited to see win, and which wins surprised you the most? Let me hear all your thoughts in the comments, and after that click right over here to check out the best moments from the show.

About SXSW:
Started in 1987, South by Southwest (SXSW) is a set of film, interactive, and music festivals and conferences that take place early each year in mid-March in Austin, Texas. SXSW’s original goal was to create an event that would act as a tool for creative people and the companies they work with to develop their careers, to bring together people from a wide area to meet and share ideas. That continues to be the goal today whether it is music, film or interactive technologies.

The ICU is where some of the sickest, most unstable patients get transferred in the hospital. It's a place where patients can be closely monitored so that we can intervene when needed. The stakes are very high!

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

What better way to start off the new year with a SWEET new cake recipe that absolutely ANYONE can do!? That’s why this week, I’m caking FIVE super simple, but super DELICIOUS mini tiered cakes! These cakes are the perfect way to introduce yourself to working with fondant if you’re still a beginner and is especially great for events, birthday parties and sweet tables.

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

The Inca through ingenious engineering and strict central planning forged one of the world’s most unusual empires. The largest empire in the pre-Columbian Americas, without a written language, the wheel, or money and one of the only empires to stretch upwards rather than across. In this video, we will look at how the Inca rose to power from unknown origins and dominated their region.

#上海迪士尼 #Disneyland 

這次去繩索探險道竟然在維修QQ
有看到一點點玩具總動員園區,4/26開幕唷

1.加勒比海盜-沈落寶藏之戰
推薦指數☆☆☆☆☆
上次來沒玩到,超級無敵精彩
很想再玩第二次

大推薦有來一定要玩這個
雖然LEE先生跟他妹妹在美國也玩過了
但他們也是很推薦

2.創.極速光輪
推薦指數☆☆☆☆☆
因為第一次只有我跟LEE先生兩個人來
所以我不得不捨命相陪
所以第二次我就沒玩了
這個是LEE先生妹妹這次來最想玩的項目

3.探險家獨木舟
推薦指數☆
超級無聊,超級累人
因為你必須要一直划,划回去原本上船的地方
一路上也沒有什麼好看的或是刺激的
也不能拍照錄影
不推薦

4.小飛俠天空奇遇
推薦指數☆☆
就是跟小熊維尼一樣,帶你看一個故事書的感覺
只是小飛俠是坐在腳騰空的設施上

就是....你懂得
很適合帶小朋友玩的一個項目

5.七小矮人礦山車
推薦指數☆☆☆
第二次玩,可怕程度降低
但因為是園區裡也算刺激的
所以喜歡刺激的還是可以玩一下

6.漫威英雄總部
推薦指數☆☆
LEE先生妹妹原本想說應該會是個設施
後來來看是個類似展場
有可以拍照的背版,也有遊戲可以讓人玩

但因為我對這個沒什麼興趣
加上也沒什麼吸引人的
所以我們看看就走了

7.冰雪奇緣.歡唱盛會
推薦指數☆☆☆☆
很適合帶小朋友來,他們一定會很開心
整體來說是也不錯精彩

歌曲當然都很好聽
也都是中文版的
可以聽見很多人都跟著一起唱
害我不小心笑場了一下

8.我們這次一樣是吃皮諾丘鄉村廚房
推薦指數☆☆☆
不想出錯,所以沒有開發新的(哈哈)
但真的蠻推薦他們家的比薩
