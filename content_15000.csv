Embrace the resonance of the full blood moon during this shamanic journey. We are created out of water, the moon is said to be master of water.  What we are is simply this open space of awareness. 
Powerful shamanic drumming will  keep Your consciousness awake during this journey, the Gong will remind You to breathe deeply, slowly and consciously even when the drum is moving You, breathe calmly. Zen Meditation. Use this like a Medicine. 
There is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, only wholeness, completeness and unity.

Description:
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has had one marvelous career. Five Super Bowl championships and two MVPs. Who could have expected that, considering he was a sixth round draft choice?

TB-12 has had a dominant career that has spanned two decades. Despite so many remarkable plays throughout his career, we only had room for 10 here.

I’m Justin Fraction, and today we present the 10 greatest plays ever made by Tom Brady.

LYRICS: 
I got it good girl
‘Cause I’ve got myself a good girl 
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl
You’re an angel 
You’re a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I’m loving just livin
Every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights until the day that you called me yours
And they say when you know you know 
And I know one thing’s for sure

CHORUS
I got it good girl
‘Cause I’ve got myself a good girl 
Still can’t believe I found you
Can’t imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aww so good baby

You know sometimes I dream
About 55 years from now 
Gonna still be you and me watching that sun goin down
I’ll still be stealing your kisses (what else)
I’ll still be holding your hand (what else)
I’ll still look at you and I’ll pinch myself good lord I’m a lucky man

REPEAT CHORUS

I was lost in the neon lights until the day that you called me yours
And they say when you know you know 
And I know one thing’s for sure

REPEAT CHORUS

Good girl
Still can’t believe I found you
Good lord I’m a lucky man
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aww so good baby

Cold coffee sucks.  When I heard there's a new gadget that can keep your coffee at the perfect temperature, I knew I had to try it. The Ember mug is a rechargeable insulated travel mug that promises to keep your beverage at what it calls the perfect drinking temperature for hours.

Don't think of Ember as a heating mug. Instead it's built for cooling and holding temperature. I initially thought it was going to keep my coffee at stovetop temperature until I was ready to drink it. Not so; the Ember mug is designed to let your beverage cool to a drinkable temperature you select then hold it there.

When you're ready to transport your beverage pour it in and press the Ember power button. The mug will remember your last preset temperature or you can adjust it tin the app or by dialling it in using the temperature control ring on the bottom of the mug.

The built in battery on the Ember keeps your drink at temperature for about 2 hours in my experience.

Indeed that's true as I found that with the lid open, my beverage cooled much more quickly.
One way to keep your drink at optimal temperature longer is to use the charging coaster.

A big complaint with travel mugs is that they can leak like a son of a gun. I've gone through many travel mugs and many wet lunch bags thanks too poorly ceiling travel mugs. I was pleasantly pleased to see that the 360° lead seals magnificently. The 360° lid refers to the fact you can drink it from any angle; there's not just one spelled for opening in the lid, so wherever you grab it from you'll always get a sip.

You can use this mug in Fahrenheit or Celsius and with iPhone or Android phones.

If you like piping hot coffee, this mug is not for you. As i said before, the idea behind this mug is that it cools and holds temperature, and the top end heat level, 62.5 degrees isn;t what I'd call piping hot. It's drinkable.

If you're the kind of person who is forever burning their tonge on scalding liquids, this mug is perfect for you since you can control the heat. No more tentative sips and scalded mouths. With Ember, you'll always know the beverage you love is perfectly drinkable.

I love the idea of this mug and found it easy to use and that it operates precisely as it describes.

The 2 hour battery life is a bit disappointing for me; I'd love a bit more juice out of this mug. But at the same time, 2 hours is all Ember promises. Of course if you need your beverage hot a bit longer, using it with the coaster is the answer.

I realized after this experiment I actually prefer to start drinking my coffee when its much hotter, and the top end temperature of the Ember mug, 62.5 degrees, just isn't hot enough for me.

Whether or not you should get this mug depends on the kind of hot beverage drinker you are; if you need your drink piping hot, this isn't for you. If you will only sip when it's cool enough, you could get a lot of mileage out of the Ember mug.

The Ember mug aint cheap; it sells for about $150, at Starbucks and from Ember's website.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgTNevMtP6U/sddefault.jpg,0.012626969362724923,0.000329256045964144,38.35,0.001333486986154783,0.012956225408689069,0.01428971239484385,2017-12-12,23:25:33,Tuesday,1,5,18,5,15,29,134,0,37,0,0,4,0,0,0,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.897434814502771,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Tom Cruise is probably the undisputed king of the bizarre, awkward interview, but he's not alone when it comes to cringe-worthy celebrity Q&As. Whether an interviewer intentionally asks provocative questions, or the star maybe just isn't feeling it after a long press junket, it's satisfying when the cameras record these tense interactions. Here are the stars whose press agents probably should have been a little quicker to throw in the towel...

Ih13k5FZb7E,uQWuC7L4_DQ,Hawaii's Kilauea volcano shoots fountains of lava into night sky - Daily Mail,Daily Mail,25.0,2018-05-20 10:33:55+00:00,"[""hawaii's kilauea volcano"", 'fountains of lava', 'night sky']",13266.0,41.0,6.0,12.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ih13k5FZb7E/default.jpg,"Lava pouring from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano was seen consuming homes on Saturday as streams began to travel at speeds of up to 1,000 feet in less than an hour. One picture, taken on Saturday, shows lava rushing towards a home in Pahoa (circled) after consuming another moments before and leaving what remained of it up in flames. Fresh lava moves faster and spreads further than old lava. Previously the magma spurting from Kilauea was from a similar event in 1955. Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but the eruption in 1955 lasted 88 days.

We made a box fort zombie survival base similar to the base we built doing zombie week. This video took a crazy turn once we found out what was in the secret package. We had to use all our box fort building skills to survive this challenge. Luckily we had nerf guns and other toys to help us in this awesome adventure.

This ring, thanks to the CANON Visual Dictionary - shows us where this ring is from and the etchings on it that belong to a very old group of sages...Now these sages were found as statues in Palpatine's office in Revenge of the Sith as he walks with Anakin and fights Mace Windu before Order 66. What connection could Snoke have to these sages? Could he be one of them? The obsidian was found in Darth Vader's Castle on Mustafar...could this bring scenes in Han Solo that could explain things further about Snoke's ring? Or do you think this was something gathered far before Anakin and Darth Vader ever set foot on Mustafar?

10.) Satellites Don’t Exist
Flat Earth believers state that one reason they know the Earth is flat is because satellites do not really exist.  Instead, they say, that satellites, even ones taken to space, are actually CGI composites (Computer Generated Images) . Many flat earth believers explain that for communication, such as the internet and cell phone reception, there are underground cables that connect everything to everyone.  They also argue that there are underwater sea cables, which connect all the continents with redundancy and also helps with connection through the internet. Flat Earth believers also state there is no GPS for airplanes traveling too far south of the equator or too far out on the ocean. They lose all communications because there are no towers available, which would explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle. Furthermore, they state that there is no credible proof that satellites do exists, stating there are no actual photos, no actual video footage, only CGI/Pixar/Photoshop satellites. Flat earthers further state that satellites cannot be rotating around the earth because we would constantly be losing signal as the satellite moved to the other end of the earth.

9.) Gravity is Just an Illusion
Sorry Sir Isaac Newton, but flat earth theorists are not your biggest fans.  People who believe the earth is flat state one reason is because of gravity.  They believe that if the earth was round, then when something fell, gravity would pull the object straight down toward the center of the sphere.  It would not matter where the object fell. Flat earth believers state the disc of Earth accelerates upward at 32 feet per second squared and it is driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy.  This energy is defined as an unknown form of energy which is hypothesized to permeate all of space, tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Flat earthers believe that the fact that light things rise up and heavy things fall down is simply a natural property of weight and has nothing to do with gravity. They say that gravity is a hypothetical magnetic-like force possessed by large masses which Isaac Newton needed to help explain the heliocentric theory of the universe.  Flat earth believers even state gravity would be too hard for the fish in the sea. If “gravity” is strong enough to curve the massive expanse of oceans around a globular Earth, it would be impossible for fish and other creatures to swim through such forcefully held water.

8.) NASA Conspiracies
Flat earth theorists do not really believe in anything NASA says or does. NASA is all a lie. Some people believe that the earth is flat because science, especially NASA, or anything to do with outer space, is all a conspiracy! They believe that NASA is just a tool used in order to keep things hidden, so people who believe the earth is flat argue that they are searching for the truth. In order to support this theory, flat earth theorists use examples of photographs, which I will talk about later. Flat earth believers go on to say that pretty much every rocket, plane, drone and other amateur footage taken over 20 miles high shows a perfectly flat horizon. Furthermore, flat earth believers state that if the world really was round, NASA would be able to easily prove it through one of the satellites orbiting the earth; however, since they have not done this, because satellites don’t exist remember, it proves that the earth is flat.

7.) Photographs
I think it would be safe to say that almost all of us have seen photographs of the Earth being round. And all the other planets as well. People who believe the Earth is flat, state that these photographs are all photoshopped, including images from NASA, of course, and it is easy to photoshop pictures in today’s day and age.  When you look at pictures, the horizon is flat and not curved.  Flat earth believers state that if the earth was curved or round, you would be able to see a curvature in pictures, however this is clearly not the case.  Flat earth believers often use NASA’s images that show curvature in the earth to debunk the round earth theory.  They subscribe to the notion that NASA takes the ""true"" images of the flat world and implements a curve in them through digital wizardry.

What is Face Yoga?
Face Yoga is a great natural solution to regain your youthful appearance, a.k.a. natural alternative to botox or plastic surgery! We wake up sleeping facial muscles in the face to lift up the skin and relax over-working facial muscles for wrinkle reduction .

My Bio:
Born and grown up in Japan where Face Yoga has been popular, I have been practicing Facial Yoga over a decade and started teaching since 2018.  (A study shows it works!)  My clients include Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashin, and more!

Voted #1 PopularYogaClass at The Yoga Expo Los Angeles
CIDESCO License Holder (most internationally respected Aesthetic License) 
Certified Facial Yoga Instructor from Japan

How did she get interested in Face Yoga?
At the age of 27, I was advised to add implant by a doctor, so did it, because the doctor told her that it can be easily removed if she doesn’t like it. Unfortunately, the chin got distorted and I didn’t like it, so obviously had it removed, but the chin has never been the same as before. It is distorted to a side (asymmetrical chin), which made me realize that I should have pursued more natural alternative such as Face Yoga! 


Interested in my private session ?
Learn in a private session (one to one) so I can analyze your face thoroughly about room for improvement, your facial expression habits, your face posture, etc and provide specific exercises and tips only for you! Plus, you will receive a mini video of the exercises that we cover during the session, after the session, so you can review later. (In-Person or Online)

subtitles available, if you're into that sort of thing.

had this like 80% finished when brigette released, thought it was better to upload as is rather than delay even further by making new brigette based content. getting the ball rolling with this one felt particularly hard, which is why there is over a month between this video and the last one. at least i don't have to make a thumbnail. i've got plans for some measures i can take to speed up making these videos, so maybe the next one might not be too far away, but no promises. might also be getting a new PC soon so will actually be able to edit and record stuff much better. may try some other styles of content, lose all my subscribers and then delete my channel.

(also blizzard, the audio balance on the last dev update was a bit off, pls don't do this to me.)

We started with the 3 hour Marceline to Magic Kingdom tour (it was around $55) and I really liked it! Although this is vlog is super shortened version of the tour, we highly recommend checking out the full tour if that's something that you're interested in. We started with a look at how Walt's childhood really shaped the look and feel of Main Street USA. Then we talk a walk over to Liberty Square and hear more childhood stories about Walt. We then take a look at Haunted Mansion and we learn new trivia and fun facts that we've never heard before, it was really interesting. We couldn't bring the camera in the area with the ballroom scene which was a bummer but it was awesome!! We end the day with more stories about Walt, it was a really awesome tour and it full of really interesting info! We hope you enjoyed this look at the Marceline to Magic Kingdom tour! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

Season 7 Episode 15 
When Cuddy is admitted to the hospital with what may be life-threatening symptoms, House is confronted with the fact that he is not the supportive boyfriend Cuddy needs him to be, and her surreal dreams (including a scene choreographed by Mia Michaels) may be trying to tell her something about her relationship with House. Meanwhile, the team treats a student (Brett DelBuono) whose emotional scars run deeper than his physical ones, and Taub must decide if the student is a threat to others, or a kid struggling to find his way.

SUMMARY - Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his LA Galaxy debut in remarkable fashion with a 40-yard equaliser and a stoppage-time winner in a stunning 4-3 win over Los Angeles FC.

The high-profile signing from Manchester United announced his arrival in Major League Soccer by lashing home a bouncing ball from way out just six minutes after coming on as a substitute as the Galaxy fought back from 3-0 down. And he then headed home at the death to crown a magnificent derby comeback.
LAFC had been in total control thanks to a first-half double from former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela and Daniel Steres' own goal just after the restart.
But Sebastian Lletget pulled one back in the 61st minute and, two minutes after the introduction of Ibrahimovic, Chris Pontius struck in the 73rd.
The 36-year-old Swede then took centre stage with his spectacular 77th-minute leveller, ripping his shirt off in celebration, before glancing home the winner.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IlhsEvScJKE/sddefault.jpg,0.006376564374973736,0.00042606407069784236,14.9662100456621,0.0001431886557231105,0.0068026284456715784,0.0069458171013946895,2018-04-27,20:14:47,Friday,4,13,16,12,13,68,105,3,11,2,4,6,9,0,0,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.334471299369366,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Can fire ants conquer water? Moving my massive fire ant colony into their new home, a 100 gallon South American biotope (all animals and plants from South America) paludarium (half land- half water) was an intense experience to witness! At the onset, it seemed the fire ants, a colony we call the Fire Nation, was having troubles dealing with the river we made in the setup, not to mention being completely chastised by the river's fish. Watch how the Fire Nation deals with their new life in the Selva de Fuego, and check out the surprises and twists that happen along the way. Hope you guys enjoy this week's episode!

Also as mentioned in this video we had a short, interactive Youtube Live feeding this week of the Golden Empire (link here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vZEY2A9f_jsGOMem2engemIv_qa2-tg ) that failed due to slow internet speeds.

This song is jam-packed with metaphors, which presents a challenge when translating a song.  You’ll see different interpretations of the lyrics, but we really hope that this one reflects the overall meaning of this beautiful song. 

For example: 
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down – if you do Makaton CORE VOCAB signing, you could do BAD + TALK + SAD.  This would still be correct and convey meaning if you feel that what we’ve chosen here is too complex.  But as we are also trying to expand our signing repertoire for some users -  for this line we introduce the sign for ABUSE (index fingers jab downwards), for ‘sharpest words’, which then in turn make someone feel ‘unimportant’ ie. Cut down.

“I’m gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out”.  You will see that we don’t do the sign for FLOOD – as this is a metaphor for being more vocal and louder than the abusers.  The ensemble in the film is standing up against abuse.  There is no drowning other than “drowning” out the sound of abuse – so here we’ve signed “SHOUT / LOUD / PROUD” as this is really the meaning of the line.

Same goes for ‘bullets’ – this is more abuse, do not sign shooting! 

Here are the lyrics with our sign transcription:

I am not a stranger to the dark (KNOW  / DARK) [ie. ‘familiar’ with the dark]
Hide away, they say (HIDE / TALK)
'Cause we don't want your broken parts (NO / WANT / BROKEN / BODY)
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars (LEARN / SHAME / OPERATION) [nb. scars are not necessarily physical - could sign WORRY if scars are mental ones - or DIFFERENT if the 'scars' are your differences]
Run away, they say (RUN / SAY)
No one'll love you as you are (NO-ONE / LOVE / YOU / YOU /ARE) 
But I won't let them break me down to dust  (NO / ALLOW / BREAK / ME)
I know that there's a place for us (KNOW / PLACE / US)
For we are glorious (WE / SPECIAL)
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down (ABUSE / ME / UNIMPORTANT) 
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out (SHOUT / LOUD / PROUD) 
I am brave, I am bruised (I / BRAVE / I / PAIN) - 
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me (I / WHO / I / BE / THIS *POINT TO SELF / ME)
Look out 'cause here I come (LOOK / I / COME)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (WALK / DRUM) [*literal translation here]
I'm not scared to be seen ( I / NO / SCARED  / TO SEE)
I make no apologies, this is me (NO/ SORRY / THIS / ME)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Another round of bullets hits my skin (ABUSE / ME / BODY) 
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in (*gesture* C'mon!! / TODAY / NO / SHAME / INSIDE ME)
We are bursting through the barricades and (BREAK / THROUGH / WALL)
Reaching for the sun (we are warriors) (REACH / SUN / WE / STRONG)
Yeah, that's what we've become (yeah, that's what we've become) (YES / WE / BECOME)
I won't let them break me down to dust (NO  / ALLOW / BREAK / ME)

Researchers at the Wyss Institute, Harvard SEAS, and MIT CSAIL have developed a novel design approach for origami-inspired artificial muscles, capable of lifting 1000x its own weight.

The muscles are made of a compressible skeleton and air or fluid medium encased in a flexible skin, and are powered by pressure difference. The muscle motions are programmed based on the structural geometry of the skeleton. Multi-directional motions can also be programmed into the material. Artificial muscles can also grip, lift, and twist objects.

A variety of materials and fabrication methods can be used to create low-cost artificial muscles. These artificial muscles are fast, light-weight, and powerful, and could be used for miniature medical devices, deployable structures, or wearable robotics.

Starting at 5:30 a.m. Eastern, NASA TV will offer a livestream of the Moon. This full moon is the third in a series of “supermoons,” when the Moon is closer to Earth in its orbit -- known as perigee -- and about 14 percent brighter than usual. It’s the second full moon of the month, commonly known as a “blue moon.” The super blue moon will pass through Earth’s shadow to give viewers in the right location a total lunar eclipse. While the Moon is in the Earth’s shadow it will take on a reddish tint, known as a “blood moon.”  More: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/super-blue-blood-moon-coming-jan-31

안녕하세요 오늘은 색다른 크렘브륄레 마카롱을 준비했어요 
+ 레시피는 브리첼의 스위트 홈베이킹 책을 참고했어요 

톡톡 깨먹는 재미가 있는 크렘브륄레를 마카롱으로!
예전부터 판매가 되는 곳도 종종 있었는데요 책에도 있길래 만들어봤어요 

영상에 마카롱 꼬끄 색이 다른게 있는데 제가 따로 더 만들어 둔겁니다 
색소는 넣어도 되고 안넣어도 됩니다 (안 넣은게 더 이쁨)

+ 먹는소리 좋아하시는 분들이 있으셔서 먹는 소리 넣을 때는 제가
최대한 먹을 수 있는 만큼을 먹어보는데요 너무 많이 먹는것 같다고 하셔서 오늘은 하나만 먹었어요 희희 (1개를 반입씩 먹었어욥)
소리가 짧아서 따로 제목에 표시는안했습니다아~

카라멜소스는 없어도 충분히 맛있을 것 같아요! (넣으면 더 맛있움)
제가 해보고 나서 약간의 팁을 드리자면 위에 설탕 시럽을 골고루 
다 바르시는게 태울 때 더 예쁘게 되는 거 같아요 (다 만들고 깨달아버림..) ㅋㅋ
카라멜화 된 설탕과 바닐라 버터크림이 너무 잘 어울리고 
마카롱도 쫀득하니 너무 맛있는 디저트에요 ~
티타임에 어울릴 것 같아요 ! 꼭 만들어 보세요 


▶재료 (30개 분량)

- 마카롱 꼬끄(쉘)
아몬드가루 184g, 슈가파우더 168g, 흰자 140g, 설탕 140g

- 버터크림
바닐라빈 1/2개, 노른자 45g, 설탕 40g, 우유 55ml, 버터 165g

- 카라멜소스
물엿 55g, 설탕 80g, 생크림 85ml, 버터 15g

- 기타 
물 25ml, 설탕A 20g, 설탕B 적당량

▶ 만드는 법
1) 마카롱쉘
-아몬드가루, 슈가파우더를 체쳐 섞어줍니다 
-다른볼에 흰자를 담아 휘핑합니다 (설탕 3번 나눠 넣어가며 휘핑)
-중속으로 천천히 머랭을 올려 단단하고 윤기나는 머랭이 완성되면 체친 가루를 넣어줍니다
-주걱으로 섞어줍니다 (반죽 농도 영상으로 확인)
-반죽을 1cm 원형깍지를 끼운 짤주머니에 담아 팬 위에 짜줍니다 
-건조한 실온에 말려 손으로 만졌을 때 묻어나오지 않으면 150도 예열된 오븐에 13~15분

2) 버터크림
-바닐라빈을 반으로 갈라 씨를 긁어내 볼에 담아줍니다
-노른자와 설탕을 넣고 섞어줍니다
-냄비에 우유를 담아 가장자리가 끓을 때 까지 둡니다
-끓인 우유를 노른자에 넣고 섞어주고 다시 냄비에 부어줍니다
-약불로 82도가 되도록 끓입니다
-끓인 재료는 체에 한번 걸러 식혀줍니다
-버터를 볼에 담아 풀어주고 식은 노른자 반죽을 넣고 아이보리 색이 되도록 휘핑합니다 
-1cm 원형 깍지를 끼운 짤주머니에 담아둡니다

3) 카라멜소스
-물엿과 설탕을 냄비에 넣고 끓여줍니다 (중약불)
-카라멜 색이 되도록 태워 생크림을 넣어줍니다
-골고루 섞어주고 농도가 조금 진해지면 불에서 내려 버터를 넣고 섞어줍니다
-끓인 소스는 차게 식혀줍니다

4) 기타
-물과 설탕을 섞어줍니다 (뜨거운물)
-붓으로 시럽을 마카롱 쉘에 발라줍니다
-설탕을 찍어줍니다
-토치로 설탕을 태워줍니다
(마카롱 쉘 절반만 설탕을 발라 태워주고 나머지는 그대로 둡니다)

5) 마무리
-영상과 같이 버터크림과 카라멜소스를 샌드합니다 

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다
시청해주셔서 감사합니다

ABOUT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 2:

Journey to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games! Fight alongside unforgettable characters in a stunning new solar system, as you struggle for freedom and the right to determine your own fate among the stars. Play the adventure by yourself or with friends in a vast and seamless online playground.

Beyond Good and Evil 2 is the spiritual successor to the cult classic, a prequel that will transport players into a profoundly multicultural world, capturing the spirit of the original with grandiose decors and intense dramas that play out across a vast universe. Through the Space Monkey Program, Ubisoft Montpellier will be developing the game alongside its community of fans.

System 3 has become the center of interstellar trade and colonization in the Milky Way of the 24th century, thanks to the creation of Hybrid slaves. While private enterprises fight over resources and power, the first colonists weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth to give meaning to their existence. In this new era of piracy, we will rise from lowly pirate to legendary captain at the helm of massive star-faring vessels, adventuring alongside crews of colorful characters to fight for freedom and the right to determine our own fate among the stars!

This year China has declared it no longer wants to be the world's dumping ground and this reality has thrown Australia's recycling system in crisis with the very real possibility that our recycled waste will be heading for landfill here soon.

Hacking industrial control gateways

Small gateways connect all kinds of fieldbusses to IP systems. This talk will look at the (in)security of those gateways, starting with simple vulnerabilities, and then deep diving into reverse-engineering the firmware and breaking the encryption of firmware upgrades. The found vulnerabilities will then be demonstrated live on a portable SCADA system.

Companies often utilize small gateway devices to connect the different field-busses used in industrial control systems (such as Modbus, RS232 etc) to TCP/IP networks. Under the hood, these devices are mostly comprised of ARM-based mini computers, running  either custom, tiny operating systems or uClinux/Linux. The talk will look at the security aspects of these gateways by examining known and unfixed vulnerabilities like unchangeable default credentials, protocols that do not support authentication, and reverse engineering and breaking the encryption of firmware upgrades of certain gateways.

The talk will consist of a theoretical part, an introduction on how to reverse-engineer and find vulnerabilities in a firmware-blob of unknown format, and a practical part, showcasing a live ICS environment that utilizes gateways, from both the IP and  the field-bus side, to pivot through an industrial control system environment: Demonstrating how to potentially pivot from a station in the field up to the SCADA headquarters, permanently modifying the firmware of the gateways on the way.

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote takes in a Sydney Funnel Web Spider for venom extraction!

In Australia there is one species of spider that strikes fear into the hearts of many, and that spider is none other than the Funnel Web! Intimidating in appearance with their up to half inch long fangs, these arachnids possess a dangerous neurotoxin that is particularly deadly to humans. Without proper antivenin after a bite the Sydney Funnel Webs venom has been known to kill humans within hours. Seriously just one bite can kill you! Yikes!

However after the start of an ambitious statewide antivenin program at the Australian Reptile Park no one has actually died from a Funnel Web Spider bite in over six years.

Get ready to see Coyote milk venom from the most dangerous spider on earth!

The interior design firm Ashe + Leandro turned Schreiber's old bachelor pad into a home for him and his two sons.

From the AD article: Liev Schreiber Invites AD to Tour His New York City Apartment

""Client-designer communication can be a delicate thing. It doesn’t typically involve quoting “Sprockets.” But in 2016, when Liev Schreiber decided to retool his triplex apartment in Manhattan’s NoHo district, the Saturday Night Live reference just seemed right. The initial brainstorms yielded proposals that struck the actor as “uncomfortably Teutonic,” he says, recounting his lively give-and-take with Ariel Ashe and Reinaldo Leandro, the 30-something principals who head up the AD100 New York design firm Ashe + Leandro. “Like, ‘I know you want to touch my monkey.’

Schreiber, of course, nails this line—the accent, the inflection—with diamond-laser accuracy. He couldn’t have found a better audience for it. Ashe’s first design job was on set at SNL, and her brother-in-law is Seth Meyers. Suffice it to say, she has a sense of humor. More to the point, Ashe and Leandro’s work has an easygoing cool to it; it’s rigorous, but it’s also relaxed, not unlike the duo themselves. So, you don’t want “Sprockets”? OK, no “Sprockets.” Put into practice at Schreiber’s apartment, the Ashe + Leandro approach—modernist yet utterly livable—has yielded something that all three agree is rare in the age of too-tall, too-skinny condo towers and Edison-bulbed brownstone renos.

The space itself has some backstory: Starting in the late ’90s, Schreiber cobbled together the three-level, three-bedroom apartment from a couple of units in this circa-1880, redbrick, Neo-Grec industrial building. The Yale Drama grad’s career had taken off following a breakthrough role in Nora Ephron’s Mixed Nuts. Soon enough came Scream (and Scream 2), and an eye-opening turn as Hamlet in 1999 at the Public Theater, just a few blocks away. The bachelor pad, tricked out with help from his older brother, a stonemason, served Schreiber well.

After he partnered up with Naomi Watts, in 2005, the place became the stage for a whole new production: family life. (Their sons, Sasha and Kai, are now ten and nine.) Still, the couple got the itch for a new home. And in 2012, they found digs farther downtown, hiring Ashe and Leandro to do the job (AD, March 2016). When Schreiber and Watts separated, in late 2016, he was determined to create something new from his beloved old NoHo apartment. He felt a real rapport with the designers, so he enlisted them to update the space for his life now.

The actor may play tough on TV, but we’re talking about a fellow who’s been known to dip into Seneca and Montaigne, who spends quality time with the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, whose IMDb listing oozes quality, and who is a familiar presence around the neighborhood, walking Woody, his very cute Hurricane Harvey rescue dog, or cycling with his boys. With his mix of well-honed urbanity and street savvy, Schreiber is every bit a New Yorker’s New Yorker.

So is the apartment, with its distressed-oak floors, steel staircases, wide-open flow, and old-school galley kitchen with new-school black stone counters and sleek Miele appliances, where Schreiber might offer a visiting friend fresh-baked banana bread and a cup of PG Tips tea. It’s also where he gathers his sons for meals, for their presence is unmistakable here, from the bedrooms outfitted with Prouvé and Eames chairs and Harry Potter wands to the board games and the student nylon-string guitar propped up in the living room.

Schreiber’s own quarters are a low-key affair, with one indulgence: a walk-in closet, which prompts him to exclaim, “This I thought I would never have!” Up on the top floor, there’s a glassed-in mini gym flooded with light. “This is the room Ray Donovan built,” he jokes. It doubles as a meditation room. (Schreiber spent part of his childhood at an ashram school.)

For an apartment overrun by two growing boys, there’s a lot of calm and order. Schreiber likes it that way.""

[chorus: halsey]
cross my heart, hope to die
to my lover, i’d never lie
he said “be true,” i swear, “i’ll try”
in the end, it’s him and i
he’s out his head, i’m out my mind
we got that love; the crazy kind
i am his, and he is mine
in the end, it’s him and i
(him and i)

[verse 1: g-eazy & (halsey)]
my ’65 speeding up the pch, a hell of a ride
they don’t want to see us make it, they just want to divide
2017 bonnie & clyde
wouldn’t see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
ysl dress under when she takes the mink off
silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
crazy, but i love her, i could never run from her
hit it, no rubber, never would let no one touch her
swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
but, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer
intense, this shit, it gets dense
she knows when i’m out of it like she could just sense
if i had a million dollars, or was down to ten cents
she’d be down for whatever, never gotta convince, no
 

[chorus: halsey & (g-eazy)]
cross my heart, hope to die
to my lover, i’d never lie (i love you baby)
he said “be true,” i swear, “i’ll try”
in the end, it’s him and i
he’s out his head, i’m out my mind
we got that love; the crazy kind
i am his, and he is mine
in the end, it’s him and i

[verse 2: g-eazy & (halsey)]
we turn up, mobbin’ 'til the end of time
only one who gets me, i’m a crazy fuckin’ gemini
remember this for when i die
everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
my funeral will be lit if i-
ever go down or get caught, if they identify
my bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
she would never cheat, you’d never see her with a different guy
ever tell you different, then it’s a lie
see, that’s my down bitch, see that’s my soldier
she keeps that thang-thang, if anyone goes there
calm and collected, she keeps her composure
and she gon’ ride for me until this thing over
we do drugs together (together)
fuck up clubs together (together)
and we’d both go crazy (crazy)
if we was to sever
you know?
we keep mobbin’, it’s just me and my bitch
fuck the world, we just gon’ keep getting rich
you know?

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

00:12  Mould effect
It's obvious that the weight of the heavy falling beads is pulling the remaining beads from the pot. However, it's not so obvious whats causing the large arc and why the beads don't just slide directly over the edge of the pot. It's said that you should view the chain as a series of short ridged rods rather than a flexible string of isolated beads.
When the beads are pulled out of the pot by the weight of the falling beads it causes the ridged rods not only to be lifted but also to rotate. The combination of these two forces causes the end that is not being picked up to push down on the pot which in turn creates a kick. It's this kick that sort of pushes the beads up out of the jar while they are also being pulled down from the other-side and thus the arc is formed. Check out the full explanation here if you're still not satisfied. https://goo.gl/QaRyZZ

00:47 Cool pressure trick
Heating air causes it to expand and cooling it causes it to contract. The boiling water in the bottle causes the glass to get very hot so the air inside the glass also gets hot causing it to expand. When the bottle is put into the cold water it quickly cools causing the air inside to contract rapidly which creates a vacuum and sucks the water up.

01:54 The lenz effect
""Lenz's law states that the current induced in a circuit due to a change or a motion in a magnetic field is so directed as to oppose the change in flux and to exert a mechanical force opposing the motion."" When the magnet is dropped into the conductive alloy pipe it causes a change in magnetic flux. This change in magnetic flux creates a current in the Aluminium pipe which opposes the change and slows the magnet down in order to reduce the change in flux.
This video explains things way more thoroughly. https://goo.gl/idAvZs

02:56 Anti-gravity water trick
There are a couple of forces at work here, air pressure and surface tension. The atmospheric pressure all around us helps to hold the plastic in place. In addition to this, there is a small pocket of air at the top of the bottle. Because no more air can get to this pocket an area of low pressure is formed. A combination of low air pressure inside the glass and higher air pressure outside of it help to keep the plastic in place.
Next is surface tension and adhesion. Water molecules are attracted to each-other like little tiny magnets with a positive and negative end. On the surface of the water, the molecules are able to get closer to each-other than below the surface, this creates a sort of elastic surface layer.
Adhesion occurs because of the water molecules positive and negative ends are not only attracted to each-other, but also to other materials such as the plastic circle in this experiment. This causes the water molecules to adhere to the plastic whilst maintaining the surface tension with the other water molecules. It is a combination of all these factors that keep the plastic in place and stop the water gushing out. Check out this post for a more detailed explanation.  https://goo.gl/crM6Xy

04:16 Water on a string surface tension trick
^^^This trick works on the same surface tension and adhesion principles as the one above ^^^

04:52 Ring catch chain trick
The trick with this one is in how you drop the ring. If you let go of the ring with both fingers at the same time it would just drop to the floor. What you need to do is just release your thumb and keep your finger still. When you do this it causes the ring to fall at an angle which in-turn causes the chain to loop itself over the ring and get caught.

05:43 Fork and spoon center of gravity trick
Every object has a center of gravity. This is the central point at which gravity acts upon the object. When you position a fork, spoon and tooth pick in this way, the center of gravity or the pivot point happens to be completely central and towards the far end of the tooth pick which just looks so wrong. It looks even more impressive when you burn the toothpick at both ends, this has no effect on the center of gravity so everything remains balanced. The reason the toothpick does not continue to burn past the metal of the fork or the glass is that when it reaches these points its robbed of its heat and goes out.

Each Friday at 9AM I upload a new video in a series called DEAR CARRIE, essentially video diaries to my sister in law who we never get to see. Tom adds his thoughts into the mix on Sundays with Carrie replying on Wednesdays.

ULTIMATE HEADPHONE TEST !!! (Wear Headphone)


Buy some Top headphone brands :

18.  Plantronics (57)

17. Beats by Dre (58)

16. Skullcandy (62)

With apologies to celebrities, NBA players, and extreme sports athletes around the globe, our analysis was not kind to Beats by Dre or Skullcandy. Yes, each brand has a handful of decent products (ex: Beats’ Solo HDs, Skullcandy’s Navigators), but the average, mid-range product from either company likely isn’t worth your money.



Tone Deaf
15. Koss (68)

14. Creative (68)

13. Philips (72)

If you know exactly what to look for, all three of these brands offer solid, reasonably-priced options (ex: some of Philips’ Fidelio line; Creative’s Aurvana, over-ear headphones). The problem: they also offer dozens and dozens of less solid, less reasonably-priced products. If you’re a gambler, you might get a cheap thrill when you scoop one of these off the shelf—like ordering rare fish at a back-alley restaurant or betting on the Dallas Cowboys. For the rest of us, it’s not worth the risk.

Unsound
12. Bose (73)

11. Apple (74)

10. Panasonic (74)

Unlike Philips and Creative, Bose and Apple have a “less is more” headphone strategy, marketing just three or four flagship products at inflated prices. If you want a comfortable fit with top-tier noise canceling, Bose’s QuietComfort 15s actually stand up to most of the hype. Unfortunately, many of their other products have received mixed reviews, and regardless, you’ll end up paying a premium on anything that comes in a box labeled “Bose.”

Then there’s Apple. They’ve been something of a joke in the headphone industry until recently, when experts gave the new EarPods a polite nod and some decent review scores. While it doesn’t quite make up for years of blown out iPod buds, it was enough for a middle-of-the-pack finish.



Sounds Good
9. Audio-Technica (74)

8. JVC (75)

7. Sennheiser (78)

If buying Philips or Creative is a reckless gamble, then snapping up one of these brands is a responsible risk, like investing in an index fund or predicting another Justin Bieber arrest. Though none of these brands are a sure-thing, each has a distinct strength. Audio-Technica produces some of the best studio headphones on the market, and often at sub-$150 prices. Meanwhile, JVC makes many of the best cheap earbuds available: good for couch potatoes and loose change scavengers. Finally, Sennheiser’s best products are universally praised by audiophiles and DJs alike.

Sounds Great
6. AKG (79)

5. Sony (80)

4. Pioneer (83)

Both AKG and Pioneer make consistently stellar headphones for DJs and audio technicians. Even better, they don’t charge a superfluous $100 just because the box says “studio” on the side.

That leaves Sony, perhaps the most surprising high-performer, especially next to all these headphone industry stalwarts. With hundreds of products in almost any price range, color, and style, Sony’s biggest accomplishment is consistency of quality.



Super Sonic
3. Klipsch (84)

2. Grado (89)

1. Shure (90)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J0a2Prc_MQo/sddefault.jpg,0.0239848720637648,0.0007848687006423564,30.55908847446073,0.003846724165869199,0.02476974076440716,0.028616464930276364,2017-12-16,15:30:01,Saturday,5,6,71,6,49,44,580,5,119,3,0,2,0,0,5,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.572186368169245,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'train': 1},1

The Boeing 737-800 from the capital Ankara was carrying 162 passengers when the incident happened around 11:25pm local time on Saturday.

Miraculously, no passengers of crew were hurt and the plane did not enter the water as it is believed the wheels and nose gear got stuck in the mud.

According to reports, the aircraft was unable to successfully decelerate, and overran the runway which was wet from rain.

VERSE 1:
From Your sacrifice for the sake of all
Redemption's birth and relentless hope
As the weight of grace crushed the face of love
AndYou bled and died for Your enemies

VERSE 2:
To woo us back from death and woe 
A valentine to a faithless world 
Every wayward heart You pursue us all  
And in kindness call us home 

CHORUS:
This world is Yours 
My God this world is Yours 
All You made to be Yours 
I know You love us all

VERSE 3:
Your agape love displaces fear 
And the plan is working heaven's near 
For the kingdom comes to the heart 
That whispers 
Have mercy God on me

CHORUS 2:
This world is Yours 
My God this world is Yours 
All You made to be Yours 
I know You love us all 

All this world is Yours 
My God this world is Yours 
All You made to be Yours 
I know You love us all

BRIDGE:
You reign forever
You reign forevermore
My heart surrendered
You reign forevermore

This is why we have a close look at the “black magic” of antennas, how they work, what is essential, and how to test them. 
Based on this knowledge we will build a cheap antenna tester for LoRa antennas. A similar device can be built to test Wi-Fi antennas. 
It uses an ESP32 TTGO board on one side and a Wemos D1 mini with a Hope RFM95 module on the other side.

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Ben Rainer -  Why is everyone already jumping to conclusions that JL is going to lose money. I understand it “only” made $94 million dollars opening weekend. But look at another movie Avatar THAT “only""
made $77 million dollars in it’s opening weekend and that turned out to be the highest grossing movie of all time.

Santiago Villa - Do you still think that the last jedi will be the biggest box office ever, beating Avatar? Back in 2015 you claimed that if Episode 7 was good and well received then ep 8 will have a good chance of beating Avatar in the Ww box office.

Jack Hunter - I was looking at the release dates for Coco on IMDB, and i was wondering why is there such a huge time period for it to be released worldwide? The first release date was October 20th in Mexico but the last date it gets released is March 16th in Japan? Is that normal for a movie to release around the world within such a big time period? especially a Disney/Pixar movie?

Ahsan - John I am a big fan. But why are you always defensive about DC? Marvel gives us many greatest comic book movies ever made! I don't know why you say in your show, that one day dc will kick marvel ass! Why? Marvel is getting bigger and bigger day by day and is more popular than dc.

Vamsi Sonti - Hi John, fan from India. My question is what do you think of the upcoming Battle Angel movie by Rodriguez and Cameron? I think it's a bad idea to make another Anime adaptation after what happened recently with Death note and GITS. Also what mistakes do you think studios are making while adapting them into live action?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J5GyfyKHBZA/hqdefault.jpg,0.03555846422338569,0.0021330230754314523,16.670454545454547,0.009840992825286018,0.03769148729881714,0.04753248012410316,2017-11-24,16:47:45,Friday,4,18,16,16,16,90,130,2,34,0,0,17,16,6,0,4.0,7.0,"['R NG', 'Pe lari', 'Pht BEANY GOOD?', '', 'THE JOHN CAMPEASHOW']","['R', 'NG', 'Pe', 'lari', 'Pht', 'BEANY', 'GOOD?', 'THE', 'JOHN', 'CAMPEASHOW']",True,"['R', 'NG', 'Pe', 'lari', 'pht', 'beani', 'good', '?', 'the', 'john', 'campeashow']",11,11,39,1,2,2,1,6.4975168853931775,3,"['sad', 'happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,"{'train': 1, 'bus': 1, 'person': 2}",4

After his five-year-old son died, he lost everything and crashed into homelessness. Here is a link to last year's interview https://youtu.be/ZiUFJuQBJmw

This week I was back out on the streets of Traverse City with an outreach team. They told me Michael was still homeless and he wanted to talk to me. They updated me a little on what happened in the last year. My heart broke listening to how Michael has gone through more tragedy. 

After I interviewed Michael last year, he was able to get inside for around four months. He was living in a house with his fiancée and a group of people. Michael's fiancée passed away, and he could not stay in the house any longer. I was told by people connected to Michael it was very tragic. 

As if that's not heartbreaking enough, Micheal's other son was killed a few months back by an improvised explosive device (IED) while serving our country. Then a few days later, his brother was murdered.

Even worse, Michael was recently diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He says that cancer has already spread from his pancreas all the way to his right side. Michael says he has a year to live. 

All though Michael has suffered more tragedy, he claims to be happy. I can't even imagine what he must be going through. 

The public needs to understand that homeless people are not homeless by choice. If you look past the homelessness, the drug abuse, and the mental illness you'll often find layers of trauma. Everyone deals with pain and suffering differently. When you see that homeless man on the streets, the public needs to know there is a story behind the person.

About Invisible People: 

Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they’re on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can’t ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation’s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J5djHKXkc6E/sddefault.jpg,0.03284670604132048,0.0004046038317764144,81.18238993710692,0.010697827099295888,0.0332513098730969,0.043949136972392784,2018-04-30,14:44:16,Monday,0,10,59,10,47,69,542,1,80,0,0,8,10,2,4,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.769664083873468,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

We love posting family friendly comedy skits, compilation videos, pancake challenges, squishy videos, slime videos,  house vlogs, Amazing Vacations and Road Trips! 

We also post funny baking and cooking videos. In the past we've made play-doh videos, unboxing videos and even cosplay videos. We love spending time together as a family and our goal is to make as many people as possible....smile.

At least ten people were killed, ten are wounded, mostly high school kids. Once again our leaders are sending their thoughts and prayers. President Trump said he is “with the people of Santa Fe in this tragic hour and will be with them forever…” except for when it comes to doing something, then he will not. Neither will any of the Governors or members of Congress who don’t ever do anything because they are fearful that it will hurt them politically. They care more about the support of the NRA than they do about children. So register to vote now. The only way we can make an impact on this epidemic is to make sure we vote for the politicians who will do something. This kind of thing does not happen in countries that have real, sensible gun laws.

[Intro: Jack Avery]
Ooh (you got a bad-, you got-, you-)

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ayy
Damn, I'm hooked (oh)

[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]
You were there when I was low, you held me high
And baby when you take control, we can go all night
Every single place we go, you start a fight
But then you kiss my neck and take a bite

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron]
Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me, me, me

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ayy
Damn, I'm hooked

[Post-Chorus: All & Daniel Seavey]
Ooh, I'm hooked
Ooh, I'm hooked (brrr- ah, pa, pa)

[Verse 2: Jonah Marais & All]
Ooh, I know that I shouldn't touch but you twist my heart
'Cause I can never get enough once the feeling starts
Baby, I'm the gasoline and your kiss is the spark
But then you take the wheel and crash my car

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron]
Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me, me, me

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ayy
Damn, I'm hooked

[Post-Chorus: All]
Ooh, I'm hooked
Ooh, I'm hooked

[Bridge: Corbyn Besson]
You got me under your influence
I swear I'm never gonna give you up, up, up, up, up, up, up

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ayy
Damn, I'm hooked

[Post-Chorus: All]
Ooh, I'm hooked
Ooh, I'm hooked, oh

We are passionate about seeing children released from poverty and we would love you to considering sponsoring a child with Compassion. We visited our sponsor children in the Philippines and were blown away by the difference that child sponsorship can make. To find out more about sponsoring a child right now, check out: http://cmpsn.co/howridiculous

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Andre Black Nerd Review of Peter Rabbit. Peter Rabbit 2018 Movie Review. Plus a random appearance from Peter Rabbit... how did he find me? Is the Peter Rabbit movie as bad as the trailers made it seem? Yes and No. There are parts that are actually sweet, genuine, and funny... and there are parts that are like every live-action/CGI movie franchise reboot we've seen before, this time with Peter Rabbit and friends. Peter Rabbit stars Rose Byrne, Domhnall Gleeson, and Sam Neill, and features the voices of James Corden, Margot Robbie, Daisy Ridley, Matt Lucas, Elizabeth Debicki, Sia, and more.

Note: Trailers and Clips from Sony Pictures Animation for press to use for reviews, criticism and commentary purposes under rights of fair use. All opinions 100% my own. Peter Rabbit costume theater appearance was coincidence, not planned at all, I swear!

Description:
Celebrities have always been careful to ensure they are presented as friendly, approachable, and likeable characters. Their very livelihoods depend on the general public thinking they’re good people, which is why virtually every celeb has a team of PR people to advise them on how to behave and how to respond to certain incidents. Many will go so far as to give to charity and perform supposedly random acts of kindness in order to convince the public that they care about them.

However, the rise of social media has been making it increasingly difficult for famous people to hide the fact that they, just like us regular folks, have their flaws. Camera phones have proven that their lives are far from perfect, as is their behavior. Of course, the behavior of some celebrities is less perfect than others. Some might slip up every now and then by Tweeting out an insensitive comment about some national tragedy or by showing support for the wrong politician, while others make slightly bigger mistakes such as, you know, killing somebody.

Over the past two decades, one glam rock singer has been sent to jail again and again and again and at one point even faced the death penalty for his relentless crimes. A Paralympic hero is serving time in a South African prison while authorities desperately seek to have his sentence increased beyond its initial six years. An internationally renowned dance teacher is sitting in a cell for filing for bankruptcy while hiding millions of dollars in a secret bank account. We're going to be looking at all of these criminals and more in this video.

In this lesson we will go over different ways to build blinking eye mechanisms for your project.

As a designer myself i have come across a number of amazing resources that have helped me learn and grow my skill sets. I hope you'll find this series as helpful as i have. This will also give me a break from videos since my equipment was stolen recently.

From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney's ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" an epic adventure based on Madeleine L'Engle's timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl's transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one's individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one's own light.

This recipe is perfect for using up leftover fish and rice. It originated in India as khichri, a dish made using lentils, rice, onions and spices.

As the ‘jewel in the crown’ of the British Empire, the culture of the subcontinent influenced language, fashion and food in England in the 19th century. But Indian ingredients and techniques were difficult to come by in England, so dishes were adapted to suit English tastes and ingredients. Khichri became kedgeree.

INGREDIENTS
200g cooked rice
200g unsmoked fish
50g unsalted butter
½-1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp coarse grain salt
2 eggs

Optional:
A little cream
Pickled or hard-boiled quail’s eggs
Parsley and Brown shrimp for garnishing

METHOD
Poach your fish in a mixture of half water and half milk. You’ll know that the fish is ready when the flesh becomes opaque - around seven minutes depending on the type of fish you’ve used.

Break up the poached fish into large flakes with a fork
Lightly whisk your eggs and prepare your garnishes. Slice the hard boiled quail’s eggs in half, and finely chop the parsley.

Heat the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat until it foams and just starts to brown. Add the rice and stir well to coat it in butter.

Fry it over a high heat to ensure it is piping hot throughout
Turn the heat down slightly and add the flaked fish, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir more gently now, turning the fish so that it does not break up too much.

When everything is heated thoroughly, turn the temperature right down, and add the egg mixture. Turn very gently, just enough to mix the eggs in, and before they are solid, remove the pan from the heat. The eggs should still be slightly runny, as they would be on a good omelette.

Stir in the cream to stop the kedgeree overcooking, then transfer onto a serving dish.

Garnish the kedgeree. Arrange the quail’s egg halves around the dish and add the chopped parsley for a touch of colour. Serve immediately, while the kedgeree is still hot.

----------------------------
In this clip, Solo Lucci discussed being on Love & Hip-Hop and his relationship with Alexis Skyy. According to Lucci, however, the pair didn't start off together. Lucci was actually dating Alexis Skyy's roommate at the time her and Fetty Wap were heavily involved with one another. But he said that the attraction was there from the jump and it led to their situation growing from a friendship to a brief relationship.

Solo Lucci also talked about Alexis Skyy's pregnancy. To him, the entire ordeal is a mess to the point that he doesn't believe she knows who the father of the baby is.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make these Freakshake Cakes I started with 18 pounds of my Ultimate Vanilla Cake, stacked in glasses coated with Irish green buttercream. It's all about decorating these shake cakes to your wildest dreams and for that I used classic Lucky Charms, coordinating sprinkles, sanding sugar, candy melts, marshmallows, rock candy, and giant lollipops. Don't forget cotton candy! Oh and doughnuts.  And gummy candies.  I think that's it...

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

How did he sense Jyn's kyber crystal necklace from the crowd? How can he shoot and battle troopers while being blind as a bat?

The answer is filled with canon responses by Pablo Hidalgo, as well as my theories to touch upon it.

Is this how Luke Skywalker got his kyber crystal in The Last Jedi?
Why does Snoke have a massive Kyber Crystal on his finger in episode 8? We didn't see it in The Force Awakens, so I wonder how he got it, perhaps...from this kyber temple in Rogue One?

Enjoy everyone, may the force be with you!!!

뮤지션 에릭남의 ‘솔직한 음악’으로 채워진 세 번째 미니앨범 ‘Honestly’

달콤하고 로맨틱한 남자의 대명사와도 같았던 에릭남이 그 동안의 이미지와 사뭇 다른 음악으로 돌아온다. 2년만에 발매하는 미니앨범 ‘Honestly’를 통해 지금까지 보여주지 못한, 그러나 꼭 보여주고 싶었던 색다른 모습을 꺼내 보이려 한다.

미니앨범 ‘Honestly’는 에릭남이 진정 하고 싶었던 음악들로만 이루어졌다. 에릭남이 수록된 전곡의 작사 및 작곡, 앨범 프로듀싱까지 직접 참여해 자신만의 색깔로 가득 채웠고, 뮤지션으로서의 입지를 다시 한 번 굳혔다.

또한, 이번 앨범에는 에픽하이 타블로 및 어반자카파 조현아가 작사에 참여했음은 물론, 카밀라 카베요, 저스틴 비버, 마틴 게릭스, 칼리드, 알레시아 카라, 카이고, 레이디 가가, 켈라니, 제이슨 데룰로 등 전세계적으로 가장 핫한 아티스트들과 함께 작업해온 유수의 프로듀서진들이 대거 참여해 음악적으로 더욱 완성도 있는 앨범이 탄생했다.

에릭남은 이번 앨범을 통해 확실하게 변화한 모습을 보여주기 위해 멕시코 올 로케이션으로 뮤직비디오도 촬영했다. 세 번째 미니앨범 ‘Honestly’를 통해 들려주고, 보여줄 에릭남의 ‘솔직한’ 음악에 귀를 기울여 보자.

Lyrics:
Suppose the world was not informed by real estate or power lines
The hidden river of my life, pursued by love
The whispering stone, the valley ford, the candy corn, the spirit finds
Abuse has left me on on my side, a single stone

I’m a walker, I’m a dreamer, tree house greeter, pentacostal preacher
I’m a rocker, yeah I’m a schemer, compost preacher, pioneer believer

A small betrayal, a simple thought, to shrug it off, unoccupied
The precious lake, the river bed, the rising tide
The sad surprise, the day of flags, the flooding fox, the clever chime
Awake my soul, awake my heart, and you will find

I’m a walker, I’m a drinker, Safeway shopper, thunder egg reader
I’m biker, yeah I’m a beaver, web-foot walker, trail blazing fever
I’m a lover, yeah I’m a reaper, Subaru driver, satellite receiver
I’m a trucker, yeah I’m a chaser, Pig-n-Ford rider, I’m a Nike racer

Get ready to sing and dance, laugh and love all over again.

Ten years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA. With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film. Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical. 

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker. Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers. Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.

Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna. Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful). Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).

Growing up outside of Miami, singer Joselyn Rivera recently moved to LA with nothing but determination to pursue her passion. Couch-surfing and working part time jobs to stay afloat, she’s been singing since the age of 4 when her parents enrolled her in music lessons to help her come out of her shell.

Brothers Tyler & Ryan are a singer-songwriter duo from the North East, getting their start when Tyler turned to guitar after a football injury took him off the field and Ryan began singing with him. After starting a YouTube channel in their teens to attract girls, they started to build a fan base and have evolved their music to blend folk instruments into their unique take on pop.

In this video we look back on 'El Jefecito's emotional farewell at the Camp Nou. Mascherano arrived at the stadium accompanied by his family, and his children joined him on the pitch for a guard of honour from the FC Barcelona squad. Team mate Andrés Iniesta presented him with a special commemorative image of the 18 trophies won by the Argentine in his 334 games as a Barça player.

Relive the moments the Argentinian spent before kick-off, on a day that he will never forget, in a video full of previously unseen footage.

Javier Mascherano vivió este jueves su último día como azulgrana en el Barça-Espanyol. Y lo hizo de manera muy especial. El futbolista argentino estuvo acompañado de su familia en su último día como barcelonista en el Camp Nou. Los futbolistas del primer equipo hicieron un pasillo a Mascherano y posteriormente Andrés Iniesta le entregó una imagen conmemorativa de los 18 títulos que ha ganado a lo largo de los 334 partidos disputados con la camiseta azulgrana.

En este vídeo repasamos como fue esta despedida emotivo del Camp Nou al futbolista argentino. ""He tenido la suerte de pertenecer a un grupo de jugadores magníficos y agradezco a la afición el trato recibido"", afirma Mascherano al reflexionar sobre estos siete años y medio en el FC Barcelona. Sin lugar a dudas un día que Javier Mascherano no olvidará. ¡No te pierdas este vídeo con imágenes inéditas!

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

He’s played a dragon, a sorcerer, a detective, and an intergalactic evil genius, and that’s just to name a few. For this list, we're counting down the best, most brilliant, barmy, ballsy and breathtaking film and TV performances by Benedict Cumberbatch. The Brit actor has starred in his fair share of movies, but which are his best? ""The Hobbit"" or ""Star Trek""? ""Doctor Strange"" or ""12 Years a Slave""? And let's not forget a certain super sleuth, first name; Sherlock!

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

As a follow up to the video, I actually decided to use the One Up EDC instead. After examining the Synchros more closely, reading comments, and doing some tests, I found that the pump is not as effective as it seems. To fill the same tire with my Crankbrothers pump takes less than HALF the strokes, and with the EDC pump, a third. Furthermore, the Synchros does not have a 6mm, which may or may not matter to some. I still think the Synchros is a good product, but the EDC is worth the extra weight and bulk to me.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JK6J8BTwTpk/sddefault.jpg,0.01449072437658917,0.00035164133496003565,41.20881971465629,0.0005035175535614519,0.014842365711549206,0.015345883265110657,2018-03-09,04:32:06,Friday,4,8,16,8,13,34,117,0,28,1,0,3,0,3,0,3.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.630241601575768,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

During the 2018 NBA All Star game practice sessions at Staples Center in Los Angeles, Russell Westbrook shared some of his high-flying tips to fellow Boston Celtics superstar, Kyrie Irving. Westbrook was demonstrating his usual powerful two-handed dunk off one foot, and then Kyrie tried to re-enact it while Kevin Durant watched on. The degree of difficulty of a one foot dunk might be hard for those players who are used to two-foot dunks.
It is also great to see both Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant starting talking again like best friends like they used to back in Oklahoma City Thunder.

Team LeBron won against Team Stephen 148-145. The MVP of the game was LeBron James, scoring 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, winning his third NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP).

On October 3, 2017, the NBA announced that this year's 2018 NBA All Star game format would change from the traditional Eastern Conference versus Western Conference format, and would instead switch to a draft-style format, similar to the format used by the NHL All-Star Game from 2011 through 2015 and the NFL Pro Bowl from 2014 through 2016. Each team will pick a charity/community-based organization to play for. The winning team will then donate $350,000, and the losing team will also donate $150,000 to their selected charity as well. The winning team will claim $100,000 for each player and the losing team $25,000 each.

The 10 starters chosen this year were LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozan, James Harden, and Kevin Durant.

The remaining 14 players were chosen by a coach’s vote, picking seven players from each conference. Those players are Russell Westbrook, Karl-Anthony Towns, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kristaps Porzingis, Kevin Love, Victor Oladipo, Kyle Lowry, Al Horford, John Wall, Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Jimmy Butler.

Make sure you have your ankle insurance, health insurance and life insurance before attempting 1 foot dunk!

● Kyrie is notably known for his role as ""Uncle Drew"" in the Pepsi Max commercials. An Uncle Drew movie is set for June 29, 2018, which will be produced by Lionsgate. Ever since 2011, Kyrie Irving had been playing in the Quicken Loans Arena for the past 6 years, until he came to a decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Boston Celtics back in July 2017. Back on  November 16, 2017, there was a claim by Kyrie Irving himself, saying that the Earth is actually flat.

Kyrie Irving has partnered up with major brands such as Nike, PepsiCo, Foot Locker, Panini, PSD Luxury Men's Boxer Briefs, and Skullcandy. In December 2014, Irving had launched his Nike Kyrie 3 signature shoe collection and since then the sale of his shoes is touching new heights day by day. The launch colorway was sold out in just 3 minutes. In 2016, he got equity stakes in American company Skullcandy. This deal was a part of an endorsement deal between him and Skullcandy. This move of Kyrie looks professionally good because of Skullcandy's global headphone and earbud market expected to be worth more than $17.5 billion by 2022.

● Reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook, one of the league's global superstars, inked a 10-year extension with Nike's Jordan Brand that will be the most lucrative total endorsement deal for a Jordan athlete to date. Westbrook has partnered up with major brands such as Nike/Air Jordan, Mountain Dew, True Religion clothing company, Six Star Pro Nutrition, Samsung, Barneys New York, and Westbrook Frames.

Last year, Westbrook averaged 31.6 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 10.4 assists per game to become the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double for a season. After a season’s worth of record-breaking, jaw-dropping historical performances, Russell Westbrook laid claim to the 2017 NBA Most Valuable Player of the Year award. He appeared at Basketball City in New York to accept the Bill Russell MVP Trophy on Monday, edging out two worthy finalists in James Harden and Kawhi Leonard.

His foundation, Russell Westbrook’s Why Not? Foundation was founded back in 2012 to inspire the lives of children, empower them to ask “Why Not?” and teach them to never give up. Last month, Westbrook teamed with the United Way of Greater Los Angeles to give out a brand new 2017 Kia Sorento SXL equipped with car’s registration and auto car insurance for the next year to a family.

Для второго выпуска сериала «Пропагандисты» мы постарались и нашли такого.

Хозяин главной медиапомойки страны, холдинга Лайфньюз,  Арам Габрелянов — даже не отвратительный человек, он просто какое-то животное.
А его «СМИ» выделяются даже на фоне остальных лжецов своей низкопробностью и методами работы.

Габрелянов очень любит Путина. Публично. И очень не любит Запад. Тоже публично.
Он неоднократно заявлял, что не любит роскошь, а иностранной недвижимости у него нет. Арам Ашотович однажды даже публично заявил, что отдаст свою элитную недвижимость тому, кто её найдёт.

Ну что же, теперь у нас есть квартира в Париже!

Ведь лживый мерзавец Габрелянов тайно купил себе её почти за 2 миллиона евро!

Помогите нам распространить этот ролик, хочется, чтобы больше граждан узнали истинное лицо путинских пропагандистов.

I FINALLY HAVE A VID ABOUT THEM. omg do you know how long it took me? at least 1 year, but i wanted to vid them even after season 2, so 2 years. i knew it would be challenging considering how complicated their story is. Finally i had some free time and did it.

6 minutes of pure torture and beauty which they are. don't blame me for making such a long edit. i couldn't make it shorter, i wanted all of them lol. i'm so happy now that i have this vid , i hope you too because there's serious lack of them on yt.

if you haven't seen this show and you love good quality, heart-wrenching, psychological, character driven dramas WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? i think it might be the best one in its genre. i can't wait for s4. So sad it's only in june but this vid will keep reminding me of how i love those two.

The dinosaur parkour athlete was Ninja Nate. Check out his work here:

Nick Robinson stars as Simon, whose path to true love is less than smooth as he tries to guess the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online and grapples with how to tell his family and friends he's gay. LOVE, SIMON also stars Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Miles Heizer, Keiynan Lonsdale, Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel and Tony Hale and is directed by Greg Berlanti. The film is an adaptation of Becky Albertalli’s bestselling 2015 YA novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.

Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it’s a little more complicated: he’s yet to tell his family or friends he’s gay and he doesn’t actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing. Directed by Greg Berlanti (Dawson’s Creek, Brothers & Sisters), written by Isaac Aptaker & Elizabeth Berger (This is Us), and based on Becky Albertalli’s acclaimed novel, LOVE, SIMON is a funny and heartfelt coming-of-age story about the thrilling ride of finding yourself and falling in love.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JPBe9CQfxpQ/sddefault.jpg,0.01074933741273049,0.0002612576882157044,41.14457831325301,0.0005602875723180167,0.011010595100946194,0.01157088267326421,2018-03-29,15:30:00,Thursday,3,6,58,6,49,40,440,2,79,2,0,3,45,0,3,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.414360105918743,4,"['happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,4,0,0,0,"{'clock': 1, 'handbag': 1, 'person': 8}",10

It's time to get your crimp on. For this list, we're counting down the finest, funniest, most memorable, most absurd, most outrageous and awkward moments delivered by the unique comic talent, Noel Fielding. From the Mighty Boosh to Big Fat Quiz of the Year, with a little bit of Garth Marenghi, Jimmy Fallon, the IT Crowd and Never Mind the Buzzcocks thrown in for good measure, this list raises the bar for randomness.

Here we are, some of us already into the new year! Here is a montague of how I spent my first break of this school year, thanksgiving break. We headed up to my boyfriend’s family’s house, and I was very grateful to have spent the holiday alongside my sister and them! Peaches, their house cat, was also a wonderful- albeit difficult- companion. 

Thank you, for another wonderful year! Seemed like yesterday that I was on the bus to New York, editing a vlog in 2016. I spent that week with my friends, and here, a year later already. I am endlessly grateful to have had you to share these special moments, daily highlights, and life stories with. The friendship, love, kindness, and support that comes from this community is incredible. And something I will never, ever forget. 

I cherish each moment of my days, and make the most of this life. Thank you for being here. 2018, here we come.

My heart is with you,
Annabelle

[MOMOLAND]

The best rookie MOMOLAND makes a grand comeback with its new album ‘GREAT!’ after releasing a series of songs including its debut album ‘Jjan! Koong! Kwang!’, ‘Wonderful Love’ and ‘Freeze’ in 2017.   The title track ‘BBoom BBoom’, meaning ‘giving off charms’, describes an interesting story ‘to show off my charm so that the person I have a crush on likes me.’

In this video I show you how to make things float using a physics! This principle that I use is called Bernoulli's Principle and air drag. It says that when fluids move faster they also have lower pressure. So I use a leaf blower to blow air across different objects to check which ones can stay afloat due to the drag of air holding it up and Bernoulli's principle holding it in the center of the stream.

Sound Bank 3 | Playing Less Square When Improvising

Today I go over some observations I have on how to sound less square when improvising over something that could very well end up sounding very block-y.  There are obviously MANY ways that contribute to this, but here are just 4 few in this context.  

1. Offset the bass notes (00:58)
2. Vary the order of most notes (1:28)
3. Highlight Certain Notes (2:09)
*4. Find a balance (4:21)

We eventually get sent to detention and have to escape like in a box fort prison escape. We have fun playing a box fort high school role play and even end up facing detention. We used cardboard to create our school and decorated our fort with tons of awesome toys and other cool accessories. We used allot of our building skills from our 24 hour box fort videos and billionaires box fort videos to make this. There were allot of funny moments in this vlog and this fort was a dun dream!

Lyrics:

Give me a reason 
Why I should give a fuck
You lost my sympathy
You lack that human touch 
Too many secrets
Too many past mistakes
Discoloured memories
Stained by your fall from grace
You lost my sympathy
Another whisper
Another heart to break
Stained by your fall from grace

Let it sink don't swim
I was in too deep 
But I can't let you take another piece of me  
You can break me down
Little bit by bit
But I won't let you keep another piece of me

So tell me something
Why should I stitch these cuts
You brought me misery
You took my confidence
Too many bruises
Too many hits to take
A broken promise
Another scar to make
You brought me misery
Another whisper 
Another heart to break
Too many hits to take
Another scar to make 

I can't pretend
It's not the end
Please don't pretend
It's not the end 
I won't take this 
You lost my sympathy
I've had enough of this
Stand by your fall from grace

Being a fan of The Walking Dead, especially the zombies & Lego, I was looking for an unusual way to combine the two.
 Having been introduced to Ninjago by my kids recently I came up with this idea!
 After my experiences making my Plants vs Zombies films I wanted to bring an element of blood & gore to the film, also having just acquired a Lego version of the Juggernaut from Call of Duty, I was keen to work him in as well.
 As soon  as I started working with Lego again I remembered the difficulty! I have large hands, minifigs are small. Each figure had to be taken apart & lubricated so it could move as easily as possible.
I also decided to build a non Lego set from scratch & set the whole thing at night which meant lighting was a challenge.
 I enjoyed creating this although it was very time consuming &  if you have read this far, you must be truly interested & I thank you.

Do you think her parents matter? I don't, but I want to make sure everyone is caught up to speed on just what is going on between what was said in the film, and what was actually 'meant' from a 'certain point of view' as Rian puts it...tricky stuff indeed.

have an awesome day my fellow Jedi and Sith friends! 
May the force be with you and I'll see you in the next episode of Star Wars Theory!!!

UPDATE - As you can see in the comments, Sparkee (the composer of this remix with this Bass Line in it), has confirmed this video as the only one that has the transcription 100% Correct.  So get the ultimate bragging rights by completing it yourself knowing you're playing it exactly right :)

So the story is that a few months ago Deadmau5 was listening to a remix of his song STROBE made by Sparkee that had a killer funky bassline in it.  And Deadmau5 said that the bassline was technically impossible to play.  Since then every bass player wants to prove they can play the impossible bassline.  So here's my lesson for you guys to check out so you can play the impossible bassline too!

I do a loop of it slowed down for you guys too and drop out at the end so you can play it to the track all by yourself too.

We are about modern weapons. We enjoy the old stuff and the new stuff, but what we've never discussed on MAC before are crossbows. Being heavily reengaged with hunting lately, I decided to jump into crossbows with a new Ravin R10 crossbow. This will open up a whole new dimension to our hunting and may even segue into a B channel dedicated to hunting. Anyway, join me on my first range session with my new Ravin R10 crossbow!

The Incredibles 2 is an upcoming 2018 American 3D computer-animated superhero film, and is the sequel to The Incredibles (2004). It is in production by Pixar Animation Studios, and will be released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is being written and directed by Brad Bird, the writer and director of the first film. The movie is scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018 and will be given an IMAX release.

The Incredibles 2 follows the adventures of the Parrs, a family of Supers (humans with super abilities). The Parrs include the patriarch Bob, also known as Mr. Incredible who possesses super strength, Helen, his wife and known as Elastigirl for the ability to stretch her body, and their children Violet, who can become invisible and project force fields, Dash, who possesses super speed, and Jack-Jack, their infant who can transform into a number of forms. The sequel will start ""a minute"" after the end of the first film, according to Pixar's John Lasseter, where the Parrs are just about to face the Underminer.

Voice cast
Craig T. Nelson as Bob Parr / Mr. Incredible
Holly Hunter as Helen Parr / Elastigirl
Sarah Vowell as Violet Parr
Huck Milner as Dashiell Robert Parr / Dash - While Dash was voiced by Spencer Fox in the first film, his voiced had deepened in the intervening years, leading them to cast an actor appropriate for a 10-year-old character.

John Ratzenberger as The Underminer

Wear gloves so that you can wash dishes with the hottest water possible, which will result in cleaner dishes and less streaks!
Sprinkle baking soda inside gloves to deodorize.

Wash Dishes in Order From Cleanest to Dirtiest

INSTRUCTIONS
Wash glassware first, since it is usually the easiest to clean, and to avoid spreading grease from other dishes.
Wash cutlery next. Since these go in your mouth, they should be extra clean.
Wash plates and bowls next.
Wash pots and pans next, since they may need more time to soak.
Wash cast iron pots and pans last.

Use Cold Water To Clean Dairy and Starches

INSTRUCTIONS
  Use cold water to clean dairy and starches off of dishes, since hot water can cause these substances to get gummy and sticky.

Sponge Holder

INSTRUCTIONS
  Wring out water completely and store sponge in a sponge holder between uses to prevent mildew.

Oven Rack as Dish Rack

INSTRUCTIONS
  If you run out of space in your dish rack, place an oven rack over the sink to use as extra drying space.

Clean Cloudy Glasses with Vinegar

INSTRUCTIONS
  When glasses dry cloudy with water spots, use distilled white vinegar to wipe them clean. The vinegar scent will evaporate when dry.

      9. Garbage Disposal Freshener Pods

SUPPLIES
1 cup baking soda
½ cup iodized salt

 ABOUT GHOST RECON WILDLANDS: 
 
 The Santa Blanca drug cartel has transformed the beautiful South 
 playAmerican country of Bolivia into a perilous narco-state, leading to lawlessness, fear, and rampant violence. The citizens of Bolivia have been plagued by the criminal influence of the cartel, but all hope is not lost. Now only the Ghosts, an elite US Special Forces team, can save the country from complete collapse.
 
 Armed with their tactical prowess and the latest weapons technology, the Ghosts will have to go deep behind enemy lines to complete their most dangerous mission to date. They’ll have to annihilate the alliance between the corrupted government and the cartel before the evil rises above Bolivia to become a major threat across the globe.
 
 Facing an almighty adversary in a massive, hostile environment, you will have to muster your strength, hone your skills, and sharpen your mettle to become a Ghost and take Bolivia back from its criminal tyrants.
 
 YOU DECIDE YOUR WORLD
 
 The Wildlands are a living, reactive open-world environment where every individual choice you make has far reaching consequences. With the Faction Influence System, turn each dangerous situation into an advantage by seizing control of the cartel’s traffic patterns, patrols, and movements.
 
 YOU DECIDE THE CARTEL’S FATE
 
 Play every mission the way you want: utilize stealth to take the enemy down quietly, develop a plan and execute it to perfection to strategically eliminate all targets, or just get your hands on the most lethal weapons you can find and come out guns blazing.
 
 YOU DECIDE WHERE TO EXPLORE
 
 Journey through Ubisoft's largest action-adventure open world and discover the diverse landscapes of the most beautiful (and dangerous) place on Earth, from the arid mountains to the lush jungles. Explore Bolivia on and off road, in the air, on land, and at sea with over 60 different vehicles.

VIEWER EMAILS

Sam Fisher - Big fan. Now that the Disney-Fox talks are ""gaining steam"" what do you think are the likelihood of seeing Disney getting X-Men and FF back? Also, do you think that this deal violates anti-trust/monopoly laws and will be stopped? Thanks for taking my question.

Sam Smith - I am a big fan of the show and watch everyday. I had a question about the X-Men canon. Are all the movies supposed to tie together? It seems inconsistent to me with Professor X dying in X-Men Last Stand, but being alive in Days of Futures Past and Logan.

Micky Bell - Hey John, COCO seems to be a game changer in animated storytelling, tackling death but do you think any animated studio would tackle LGBTQ issues? For example, two male or female love interests? Would parents take their kids to it? Would it be profitable? Is there widespread appeal?

John Paul Nunez - Hey John, I'm a huge horror fan, and I’ve noticed that non horror fans have a hard time understanding why we enjoy being scared by movies.  Why do you think some people enjoy feeling scared when they watch horror movies?

Nathan Oswald - With Kevin Feige saying that there will be 20 MCU movies after Infinity War, do you think he has any concerns about potentially convoluted timeline plot holes?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_F-hE0FS0o/hqdefault.jpg,0.033671638443422684,0.0017662891106874508,19.063492063492067,0.009280026914881686,0.035437927554110134,0.04471795446899182,2017-11-29,20:52:09,Wednesday,2,13,20,13,20,75,165,2,40,0,0,12,17,1,0,5.0,7.0,"['ie a', '', ' ', '', 'P']","['ie', 'a', 'P']",True,"['ie', 'a', 'P']",3,3,4,0,1,1,1,6.579333148707879,3,"['happy', 'angry', 'neutral']",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

Lyrics:
Can’t help but wondering
if this is the last time that I’ll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain
Wish I could say something

Something that doesn’t sound insane
But lately I don’t trust my brain
You told me I won’t ever change
So I just say nothing

No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter how long you’re gone, I’m always gonna want you back
I know that you know, I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
Want you back

I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
Cos you know every morning I wake up
Yeah I still reach for you

I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know, even when I say I’ve moved on
Yeah I still dream for you

No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter how long you’re gone, I’m always gonna want you back
I know that you know, I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back, want you back

You know even when I say I’ve moved on
You know even though I know that you’re gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
You know even when I say I’ve moved on
You know even though I know that you’re gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah I still dream for you

No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter how long you’re gone, I’m always gonna want you back
I know that you know, I will never get over you

No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
Want you back
I’m always gonna want you back
Want you back

3:11 - Trump outlines his, ‘America First’ national security strategy.

6:45 - Fed up with political dysfunction, a community group that's been accused of being racist is trying to do the South African government's job. 

11:53 - The Trump administration has been trying to block two undocumented teens' access to abortion providers. Judge Tanya Chutkin issued a temporary restraining order effectively tying the government’s hands—but she postponed implementing the order for 24 hours, so that the administration can have time to respond. 

14:56 - What it's like to take care of multiple family members at age 15.

The point Shani was trying to get across in this is that she was upset because she felt like I didn’t care, which is untrue but I sometimes have a hard time showing sympathy that’s just my personality. This video wasn’t uploaded for people to ‘pick sides’ but to have an opinion. People just went in and came for both of us hard hence why the comments are disabled, spread love not hate! hope ya’ll enjoy! X

Between all the historical references and surreal mix of violent and joyous imagery, it’s not surprising that many people have continuously revisited the visual in an attempt to find additional layers of meaning. Yes, there are the obvious allusions to race issues, America’s devotion to guns, and superficial distractions; however, according to Gambino’s creative director Ibra Ake, their approach wasn’t as “cerebral or calculated” as some writers think; their main intention was simply to “normalize” the black experience.

“As creators who are kind of marginalized with our voice, we try to make stuff in a vacuum in a way where we’re not influenced by what was made before us, which usually—in the media specifically— comes from a white world and a white infrastructure or a system that is controlled by white people,” Ake said in a recent interview with WNYC’s The Takeaway. “So even with this video, we kind of reduced it to a feeling—a very black feeling, a very violent feeling, but also a very fun feeling.”

No Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

Ingredients
½ stick or 50 grams butter, softened
¼ cup white sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 ¼ cup all-purpose flour
½ tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
¾ cup or 2 bar (35g) dark chocolate, chopped (or you can use chocolate chips)

Procedure
1.  In a bowl combine butter, white sugar and brown sugar.  Mix well. Add egg and vanilla.  Mix.
2. Add all-purpose flour, baking soda and salt.  Stir until well combined or until it forms a dough.  Add chopped chocolates and mix until the chocolate are well incorporated into the cookie dough.  
3. Scoop a teaspoon of the cookie dough and roll into a small ball.  Place over a plate lined with wax or parchment paper or you can also use aluminum foil.  
4. Chill the other cookie dough in the ref to prevent from getting too greasy because of the summer heat.  Just left some of the cookie dough that you’ll be cooking for the time being.
5. Greased the pan with a bit of butter or cooking oil, don’t put too much.
6. Heat pan over medium heat then lower the heat.
7. Put 3 to 4 cookie dough in the pan.  Press cookie dough using your fingers to flatten it.
8. Cover pan with lid or you can use aluminum foil.
9. Cook cookies over low heat for 15-18 minutes.  
10. When it’s already 15-18 minutes and you see the sides and top of the cookies turning a bit brown it’s already cook.  
11. Don’t worry if the cookie is still a bit soft once it cool completely it will harden up like a real chocolate chip cookies.
12. Put cooked chocolate chip cookies in a plate and let it cool.  
Yields: 19 pieces No Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies

Enjoy!

사무엘이 가진 미성의 보컬톤과 극중 천재의사 강인규(고경표)의 쓸씀함과 공허함이 조화를 이루어 이미 2화엔딩 테마뿐 아니라 4화의 극적인

부분에서 쓰여 팬들의 궁금증을 자아냈었다.


드라마 [크로스]는 ‘장기 이식’이라는 소재로 메디컬 드라마라는 독특한 장르와 긴장감 넘치는 연출력, 주인공 고경표, 조재현 등 배우들이 보여주는

압도적인 연기력까지 더해져 현재 지상파 포함 동시간대 시청률 1위와 회마다 시청률을 경신하며  웰메이드 드라마로 호평을 받고 있다.

OST 또한 실력파 뮤지션 솔튼페이퍼와 사무엘에 이어 실력과 잠재력을 갖춘 뮤지션들이 대거 참여를 예고하고 있어 기대를 모은다

JgQ-07VgJuY,Ek3aeUhHaFY,Primitive Technology: Blower and charcoal,Primitive Technology,22.0,2018-05-18 21:11:17+00:00,[],15288645.0,203963.0,6792.0,12532.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JgQ-07VgJuY/default.jpg,"I made a blower and some charcoal at the new area in order to create higher temperatures in for advancing my material technology. I took Fan palm leaves and fashioned them into an impellor (about 25 cm in diameter) held in a split stick as a rotor. I then built a housing from clay (slightly more than 25 cm diameter with inlet and outlet openings about 8cm in diameter) and assembled the blower. I opted not to make a bow or cord mechanism as I’ve done before due to the complexity and lower portability of such a device. The lighter impellor material (leaf instead of the previous bark) made it easier to spin by hand anyway as it has a lower momentum. Each stroke of the spindle with the hand produces 4 rotations, so about 2 strokes per second gives 480 rpm. The blower increases the heat of a fire when blowing into it and I would guess it’s more effective than a blow pipe and lungs but don’t how it would compare to a primitive pot or bag bellows for air supply. A small furnace was made and then fired with wood fuel. The wood was wet but managed to fuse and partially met sand in the furnace. 
To get better performance, I made charcoal from the poor quality wood. I made a reusable charcoal retort to make it. This was different from the previous reusable mound I built as it consisted of a mud cylinder with air holes around the base. To use, it was stacked with wood and the top was covered with mud as opposed to the previous design which had a side door. The fire was lit from the top as usual and when the fire reached the air entries at the base (after an hour or two) the holes were sealed and the mound left to cool. The top was the broken open the next day and the charcoal removed. Another batch was made using significantly less effort as the main structure of the mound did not need to be rebuilt each time, only the top.
Iron bacteria was again used to test the furnace. Charcoal and ore was placed in the furnace and the blower utilised. After an hour of operation the furnace was left to cool. The next day the furnace was opened and only slag was found with no metallic iron this time. I think increasing the ratio of charcoal to ore might increase the temperature so that the slag flows better. Further experiments will be needed before I get used to the new materials here.
The new area I’m in is significantly wetter than the old area and this has affected the order in which I create my pyro technology. The old spot was a dry eucalypt forest with an abundant source of energy dense fire wood. As a result, I developed kilns early on, powered with wood fuel and a natural draft, before developing charcoal fuelled forced air furnaces. In contrast, the new area is a wet tropical rainforest, where wood rots nearly as soon as it falls off the tree in the damp conditions. Wood is also more difficult to collect here because of hordes of mosquitoes (away from the fire) and unpleasant, spiky plants. Because of this I developed a forge blower first as it allows higher temperatures from a lower quantity and quality of fuel. 
This poor quality wood can further be improved by converting it to charcoal first. In future, it may be necessary to cut fire wood green and dry it as opposed to picking it up off the ground dead as was preferable in the Eucalyptus forest I came from. The blower is also handy for stoking a tired campfire back into flames, I simply scrape the coals into a small mound around the nose of the tuyere and spin the impellor. I use the blower each day I’m at the hut for this purpose to save blowing on hot coals each time I need a fire for something.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

RENOVATION DISCLAIMER:
This is a huge project for us and something we've been saving for for years. I'm very lucky that a few companies have offered either to gift their product or offered a press discount, but I can promise you that this hasn't swayed my judgment in decision making. I turned down a lot of companies who offered to help as this is an important project for me, it's my home and I would never accept something OR recommend anything that I didn't genuinely like.

I can't believe It's been almost 3 years since I made this recipe last and about 5 years ago that I first attempted it on my channel. Seems just like yesterday!! With a little help from the team over at Google,  I thought it would be fun to revisit the recipe and try a new glaze twist with it and since I've been obsessing on ""mirror glazing"" the two just naturally came together.

Here's a look at the full list:
Colin Kaepernick
Brett Favre
Robert Griffin III
Tim Tebow
Johnny Manziel

[LYRICS]
Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Men gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet victory won't prevail

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

Call in, surrender
Still, I won't feel like defeat
Men laying down their swords
Each of their own accord

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh
Take the leap like you were bound for higher ground

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap and land on higher ground",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JilMmML1E18/sddefault.jpg,0.008521350767689626,0.00019201432835430648,44.378723404255325,0.0004583831413053869,0.00871336509604393,0.009171748237349321,2018-02-11,12:04:13,Sunday,6,7,40,7,28,52,337,5,50,1,0,4,13,0,0,7.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.605496321259526,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

For the last three years Lyndon Poskitt has been stretching that comfort zone one kilometre at a time. From the safety of corporate existence to the freedom of a motorcycle and the open road to the biggest challenge of his life as he rides 150,000km to take part in the hardest class of the most brutal motor race in the world.

In 2014 Lyndon Poskitt set off from the UK with a simple goal, to ride round the world on his  motorcycle and race rallies in every continent he visits. A voyage of discovery? Or escape? As his time on the road grew, along with his hair and confidence, it dawned on Lyndon that as the world has become smaller the idea of adventure has lost it’s way.

Inspired by the early pioneers of exploration and speed, he entered the infamous Dakar Rally, now hosted in South America. Lyndon looked to the pre-commercialised origins of the race where competitors set off with very little assistance or hope of reaching the finish line. To this day, even though the Dakar Rally has outgrown it’s humble origins, it still retains the Malle Moto class for those who seek a pure test of spirit and endurance. One man. One bike. One box of tools. 12 days and 10,000 kilometers of hard racing.

In 2017, as the only competitor to ride to the start line, Lyndon was to discover the limit of his already stretched comfort zone. There would be only one way to discover what lies beyond it…

If you liked this film don't forget that you can watch Lyndons 'Races To Places LIVE' project this January as he attempts to win the 2018 Malle Moto class of the Dakar Rally all whilst being filmed live by his intrepid film crew...

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

In the 1990 Nintendo World Championship competition, Tetris was the game to beat. The winner, Thor Aackerlund, is still seen by many as the best to have ever played. Today’s Classic Tetris tournaments are played on that same version of Nintendo Tetris, using original NES game systems, controllers, and Tetris cartridges. In 2009, a player named Harry Hong became the first to achieve the highest possible score of 999,999 points. Inspired by this achievement, filmmaker Adam Cornelius produced a short film about Harry called “Max-Out”, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to document the world of competitive Tetris. As word of Adam’s Kickstarter campaign spread, rumors of max-out scores from other Tetris Masters began to surface, threatening the supremacy of Harry’s achievement. With the help of Nintendo World Championship veteran Robin Mihara, Adam searched for all of the Tetris Masters he could find. Jonas Neubauer emerged as an early max-out artist, along with the elusive original champ Thor Aackerlund. The idea of bringing these and other NES Tetris Masters together to compete in a live tournament became an obvious and irresistible proposition which was artfully captured in the 2010 feature length documentary Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters. Under the leadership of producer Vince Clemente, The Classic Tetris World Championship is currently held at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, an annual event which has hosted the tournament since 2012. Chuck Van Pelt and his organizing committee have built the PRGE into the largest classic gaming expo in the country, drawing around 6,000 attendees. Every year the scores get higher. Rivalries are revisited once again, and new players emerge to challenge the old guard. Over 20 players have maxed out the score now.

NASA’s considering sending a nuclear powered flying robotic laser guided quadcopter drone to a world with oceans, rain and maybe one of the best views in our solar system.

That’s right, this is one of two potential missions that NASA has narrowed down for their final mission in their New Frontiers Program.

Today I’m going to tell you all about ONE of those two missions as I go head to head against the publisher of Universe Today, Fraser Cain in a battle for the best potential mission.

After you’ve heard from both of us, you get to vote on which one you think should win, which almost certainly will forever shape the history of space exploration. Either that or NASA won’t care at all what we think... hmmm…

You might know Michael B. Jordan from any number of scene-stealing roles, like Steve Montgomery in Chronicle…but chances are you've never seen him as fit as he is in his most recent movies. The actor put on some serious muscle to convincingly play the son of a legendary boxer in Creed and a villainous revolutionary in Black Panther. So how did he get so swole? Here's a look at how Michael B. Jordan got ripped for Hollywood…

The little guy vs big banks. Milton Berle once famously said to Richard Pryor, ""Pick your spots baby."" This scenario is a classic example of knowing when to pick your battles.  Sometimes it's easier to let the bad guys win. Then again, maybe it's time to start holding banks accountable for their actions.  Perhaps Mahk's approach wasn't the best way to do it, but it's a start.  The question is how can you defeat something that's ""too big to fail?""

Dylan O'Brien. Ki Hong Lee. Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Today the actors of Maze Runner are in Korea, and we get a chance in the midst of their busy press tour, to take them out for some real Korean BBQ Pork Belly (and a few shots of Soju!).
We find out about how Ki Hong has introduced the others to Korean food in the past, how they had a history starting on Youtube, and of course what they think about Korean BBQ, Kimchi Jjigae, and Dwenjang Sulbab!
What a perfect way to put Sho and Andy's recommendation for foreigner's coming to Korea to the test! Enjoy!!

A big THANK YOU to girlycathy for transcribing this! She did a fantastic job!

I hope you enjoy this medley! It's been almost a year sind the game was released, but the soundtrack has really stuck with me. It was composed by Manaka Kataoka & Yasuaki Iwata, who I think did a fantastic job adapting the music to the new setting. Very fascinating how they're re-using old themes while still going in a new and interesting direction.

Music
Eiffel 65 - Move Your Body
Eiffel 65 - Living In A Bubble

Eiffel 65 is an Italian pop music and dance music group consisting of Jeffrey Jey, Maurizio Lobina and Gabry Ponte. They are mainly known for their high-charting singles ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" and ""Move Your Body"", and their 1999 studio album Europop. Their following two albums, Contact! (2001) and 2003 self-titled album, did not have significant international success, but charted in Italy. 

""Move Your Body"" is a song by Italian group Eiffel 65. It was released as the third single from their album Europop, on 30 November 1999. 

""Move Your Body"" is a bubblegum techno and disco song played in D minor at a 130 BPM. It has dance-oriented sounds and uses the same pitch-shifter based distortion as the vocals from the previous single, ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"". Group member Jeffrey Jey claimed that the song ""had tried to recall the original spirit of the dance, understood as a vehicle to bring together and communicate with people.""

Entertainment Weekly said in a review of Europop that ""Move Your Body"" was hard to be called a ""timeless masterpiece,"" but was impossible to hate it. The song was included on SputnikMusic's review of the album as an example of Eiffel 65's poor ability at writing lyrics. Billboard called it a ""kitschy electronic number"" and commented on ""the song's catchy melody, addictive lyrical redundancy, and the familiar computerized voice of the trio's Jeffrey Jey"".

The single was licensed to several labels for international release; In the UK it was licensed to Warner Music Group's Eternal label, in the US to Universal Music Group's Republic, in Germany to BMG Berlin, in France to Scorpio, in Spain to Blanco y Negro, in Australia to Central Station, and to Valentine and Avex in Southeast Asia.

The song achieved huge success in many countries, topping the charts of Austria, Denmark, France, Italy and Spain. However it could only chart at #36 on the Billboard Top 40 Mainstream, which was a disappointment compared to the #2 placing of its predecessor.

Elia Habib, an expert of the French charts, noted the great efficiency of the song on the SNEP chart, since it was strong enough to dislodge the massive hit ""Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of...)"" and to resist to its competitors, which prevented Eiffel 65 to remain a one-hit wonder, and enabled the band to become the first one to get its second number one single in France.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JlapgV9i8v0/sddefault.jpg,0.003902494891776243,0.00019817931905144348,19.691736304549675,9.417657891414e-05,0.004100674210827686,0.004194850789741828,2018-03-26,05:44:36,Monday,0,6,6,6,6,26,30,1,5,0,0,4,4,1,1,4.0,4.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.524450743534963,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Description:
What’s up Total Pro Sports? You know why you’re here.

Even the greatest of masterminds overthink and out-smart themselves from time-to-time. Take New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. He came oh-so-close to leading this team to a sixth championship.

But then he kind of sat Malcolm Butler in Super Bowl 52. Unfortunately for Patriots fans, this was not the first. The best head coach of all-time has made his fair share of head-scratching calls.

I’m DeQwan Young, and today we present Bill Belichick’s 10 WORST coaching decisions.

Lyrics:
Santa baby, slip a Rolex under the tree
For me
I've been an awful good guy
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa buddy, a sixty five convertible too
Steel blue
I'll wait up for you, dude
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the hotties that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
Santa pally, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an sweetie all year
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa buddy, one thing that I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa pally, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa buddy, fill my stocking with Canucks tix
For kicks
Through me on the first line
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Mercedes
I really do, believe in you
Now let's see if you believe in me
Santa poppy, forget to mention one little thing
Cha-ching
No I don't mean as a loan
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight,
Oh hurry down the chimney tonight

This one is for all my Hexagonians. I have been getting so many letters from fans that literally feel lost in this world. When they tell me my music gives them comfort and shines a light in a dark tunnel inside their head it literally makes everything I do worth while. Sometimes it feels like the outside world wants you to act a certain way, look a certain way and this can put a lot of pressure on your shoulders. Others may appear to be better looking and more successful, which can create dark clouds in your head. This single is an anthem for those who are searching for their identity and the statement is simple: everybody's somebody, nobody's nobody. Life is not about what others expect you to be, or what you feel you might never achieve, it's about accepting who YOU truly are and being proud of your own personal achievements.

-Don-

Everybody is Somebody
Nobody is Nobody. 

This video contains: one year of filming, 50 shows in over 35 countries, lots of love and...thousands of Hexagonians.

Lyrics: 
I save my metaphors for rainy days
When I'm too phased
But that's not here or there
So I'll give you the phrase that pays.
We're not 17
But you're my teenage dream.
If there's a chance we'll sink
Then I don't even want to try to sleep
Or dream.
I just hope it's nicer where you are
'Cause I only want to lift you up
I guess I never really said enough
For you to hear me where you are
'Cause I only wanna lift you up
I guess I never said enough
So let me tell you now:
My tired thoughts don't take vacations
Oh no.
You float up in conversations
Oh no.
You're my final destination
I know.
You're probably fine there
Just know I think you're rare.
Let's make some plans for time to waste.
Your Cali gaze
Has got me spinning, dripping 
Sweetness hidden in my face.
You know I think you're rare
I wasn't prepared 
I've gotta say
I think it's weird I need your love
I've clocked 300 ways.
You know I think you're rare
I wasn't prepared
And now my stomach's cold
And I hope it's nicer where you are.

Orlando, FL, January 30, 2018 - Peyton Manning becomes vacation quarterback to America in a new Universal Parks & Resorts commercial set to air during the Super Bowl – coaching families to take their vacation to the next level at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando Resort.

An extended version of the spot will air in the NBC pre-game show and a thirty-second version (https://youtu.be/5uqXt53F_JE) of the commercial will air during the Super Bowl.

“This is your moment,” Peyton coaches a family starting its day at a Universal theme park in the extended version of the spot. “You are more than a team. You are a family. Now let’s get out there and play.”

Manning joins the family during both spots to ensure they really do take fun to the next level. He screams on a roller coaster, scrambles away from a Raptor showing its “game face,” and has a churro intercepted right out of his hands – and more.

 ABOUT GHOST RECON WILDLANDS: 
 
 The Santa Blanca drug cartel has transformed the beautiful South 
 playAmerican country of Bolivia into a perilous narco-state, leading to lawlessness, fear, and rampant violence. The citizens of Bolivia have been plagued by the criminal influence of the cartel, but all hope is not lost. Now only the Ghosts, an elite US Special Forces team, can save the country from complete collapse.
 
 Armed with their tactical prowess and the latest weapons technology, the Ghosts will have to go deep behind enemy lines to complete their most dangerous mission to date. They’ll have to annihilate the alliance between the corrupted government and the cartel before the evil rises above Bolivia to become a major threat across the globe.
 
 Facing an almighty adversary in a massive, hostile environment, you will have to muster your strength, hone your skills, and sharpen your mettle to become a Ghost and take Bolivia back from its criminal tyrants.
 
 YOU DECIDE YOUR WORLD
 
 The Wildlands are a living, reactive open-world environment where every individual choice you make has far reaching consequences. With the Faction Influence System, turn each dangerous situation into an advantage by seizing control of the cartel’s traffic patterns, patrols, and movements.
 
 YOU DECIDE THE CARTEL’S FATE
 
 Play every mission the way you want: utilize stealth to take the enemy down quietly, develop a plan and execute it to perfection to strategically eliminate all targets, or just get your hands on the most lethal weapons you can find and come out guns blazing.
 
 YOU DECIDE WHERE TO EXPLORE
 
 Journey through Ubisoft's largest action-adventure open world and discover the diverse landscapes of the most beautiful (and dangerous) place on Earth, from the arid mountains to the lush jungles. Explore Bolivia on and off road, in the air, on land, and at sea with over 60 different vehicles.

Experience the world of Wes Anderson's upcoming stop-motion animated film, face to face with the cast of dogs as they are interviewed on set, while the crew works around you to create the animation.

Produced in collaboration with the production team of Isle of Dogs, and in partnership with Felix & Paul Studios and Google Spotlight Stories.

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Remember the words you told me
Love me till the day I die
Surrender my everything
Cos you made me believe you’re mine

Yeah, you used to call me baby

Pulling away from you

End like it’s the last goodbye
Till one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times

So who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

You’re running around and I’m running away
Running away from you

This had been a long-standing conspiracy theory floating around the internet. Apple lowered its battery replacement fee to $29 in response. 

However, many people have found it difficult to get Apple to change their batteries. We went to an Apple store to see what would happen when we tried to have the battery on an iPhone 6 replaced. Apple recommended that we keep the original battery.

Ten years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open in 2018.
 
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.
 
Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JrT6gOWRdJY/sddefault.jpg,0.012281237322107834,0.00048401932863908223,25.373443983402492,0.0005282036656932723,0.012765256650746916,0.013293460316440188,2018-02-02,06:32:06,Friday,4,7,38,7,33,44,334,1,79,0,1,6,14,4,0,5.0,8.0,['Pra'],['Pra'],True,['pra'],1,1,3,0,0,0,0,4.9447724383044065,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Pay attention to 12 common things you should avoid not to ruin the first impression. 
In his research, psychologist William F. Chaplin found that people with a weak handshake are instantly judged as being shy, anxious, uninterested, or even completely incompetent.
If you place your hands on the table, don’t squeeze them too tight or lay them flat with your palms down. This makes people feel like you want to control them. Also, don’t forget about the role that culture plays here. 
A 2007 study showed that people who maintain eye contact during a conversation are often seen as more confident, attentive, intelligent, and trustworthy.  Try not to focus the conversation only on yourself and your issues. It’s always a good idea to be attentive to your conversation partner. 
Tapping can indicate nervousness, irritation, or impatience. People might even think that you’re purposely trying to irritate others or draw attention to yourself. And while cracking your knuckles can help relieve stress, it’s one of the most annoying sounds according to a survey by The New York Times.
A study from the University of Essex showed that even just having one’s phone on the table next to them reduces a conversation’s quality and the participants’ engagement. So leave it in your bag or in your pocket.
Running late to a meeting with people you don’t know or have a formal relationship with will shed a guaranteed negative light on you. You’ll seem like an unreliable and unorganized person that doesn’t respect people enough to value their time.

SUMMARY
-If you wanna give the right impression of confidence and capability, remember to grip the other person’s hand firmly and for no longer than 2 seconds.
-Put your hands on your lap if you want, but never keep them in your pockets because this gives the impression that you’re hiding something.
-Chewing on gum makes you look immature, self-centered, and somewhat low-brow.
-Don't be afraid to lock eyes with another person from time to time instead of constantly looking around, especially when you meet them for the first time.
-If you tend to play with your hair when you’re nervous, try to kick this habit, you could be sending them the wrong message.
-Play it safe and avoid the general “taboo” topics out there. They include health problems, money, religion, politics, or personal problems and complaints. 
-When it comes to meeting someone for the first time, keep a minimum of 4 feet between the two of you.
-It can be nearly impossible to control nervous tapping, but you have to try, especially during important meetings or presentations. 
-Even if you’re just checking the time on your screen, it comes off as extremely impolite when you do it during a conversation.
-Immediately repeate someone’s name after you’ve been introduced. In case you forget the name, just play it cool and try to avoid using phrases where you have to name the other person.
-Leave your house in enough time so that you don’t have to run to your meeting. You’ll be all disheveled and unfocused, and that looks bad too.  
-If you’re meeting somebody for the very first time, again, especially in more formal situations, try to be conservative in your choice of clothing, be polished, and don’t use heavy perfume or tons of makeup.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Tom Waterloo - Hey John, love the show, please settle a bet. My wife LOVED the greatest showman and I liked it a lot; but my money is on Les Mis being the best Hugh Jackman led musical. What do you think?
Fernando Fernandez - Is Edgar Wright being overlooked for awards for Baby Driver? I don't know everything that goes into directing but in my opinion to create a movie like Baby Driver really looks like it takes some serious work and expertise. What do you think?
PATREON Supporter Kevin - Do you think WB will try to give Henry Cavill a better lip in the JL BluRay release? Nothing became more symbolic for JL fan disappointment than Superman's weird pie hole. Or, is  it: what's done is done, and no sense throwing good money after bad?
PATREON Supporter John DiNicola - Hope you're feeling better! Have you heard the report that Matt Reeves' Batman may indeed be a 'soft reboot' a la 'Batman Forever' and still take place within the DC Films Universe but with no mention of previous films (or Ben Affleck; WB has soured on him)? Thoughts?

It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.

◅ On our channel we create а trailer mashups ▻
also known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.

The trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.

On Wednesday, Donald Trump changed that. Trump overruled his top political and military advisers to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announce plans to relocate the US embassy. To give you a sense of how unusual that is: of all the countries that maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel, not one currently has an embassy in Jerusalem. And the few that have had embassies there in the past have been small countries with little connection to the Middle East, such as Costa Rica and El Salvador.

Trump's decision has been widely condemned and has sparked protests in many parts of the Middle East and the wider Muslim world. It remains to be seen, however, exactly what will change and how fast those changes will be. While making his much-anticipated announcement in Washington on Wednesday night, Trump also signed a new national security waiver, exactly the same sort of waiver regarding the embassy move that every US president has signed twice each year for more than two decades. He also said that actually building a new embassy and moving American diplomats into it is a process that will take a minimum of several years.

There is no question, however, that Trump's move will alter the diplomatic and political situation on the ground. The question is: how?

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:
The Screen Actors Guild Awards® presented by SAG-AFTRA has become one of the industry's most prized honors.

The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

The latest story comes from Inverse.com who interviewed Fabian Wagner, the cinematographer of the film, and he confirmed that there were scenes shot with Superman in his black suit.

Mark Reilly and John Rocha are here to discuss what Wagner’s comment signify about how much of a storyline this black suit Superman was going to have in ‘Justice League’. And they explore who’s to blame for these scenes being shelved after Joss Whedon came on board to finish the picture. Let us know what you think in the comments below.

LYRICS:
We’ve played this game before, but it never seems to change. We die, it still remains the same. A hidden hand in the dark, and no one seems to know how far down the rabbit hole goes. 

You don’t ask any questions, you don’t even care. You just fall in line, swallow the pill and follow.

Are we all blind? Why can’t we see? I can’t believe we all just follow the leader. How can we evolve if we live in the shadow? I can’t believe we all still follow the leader. 

We haven’t learned a thing. We still play along. I fear the worst is yet to come, and it all falls apart right before our eyes. Too scared to read between the lines. Bury our heads in the sand. Turn our back on the inevitable end. We just fall in line, swallow the pill and follow.

Are we all blind? Why can’t we see? I can’t believe we all just follow the leader. How can we evolve if we live in the shadow? I can’t believe we all still follow the leader. 

Will you play the game, will you follow? Will you play the game, will you follow the leader? I’d rather be dead and buried than give in. I’d rather be dead and buried, than give up my soul. I’d rather be dead. I’d rather be and dead than give in.

Are we all blind? Why can’t we see? I can’t believe we all just follow the leader. How can we evolve if we live in the shadow? I can’t believe we all still follow the leader. Will you follow?

LYRICS:

I'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you

[Chorus: Jenny Lind]
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

[Post-Chorus: Jenny Lind]
For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
For me
For me
For me

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JxKbfy97qYg/sddefault.jpg,0.011948567534737655,9.184368796847689e-05,130.09677419354838,0.0004769946375137024,0.01204041122270613,0.012517405860219832,2017-11-30,09:35:00,Thursday,3,9,38,9,33,54,334,1,79,0,1,8,14,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.206028393739586,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3
