Lyrics: 
Written by Cory Asbury, Ran Jackson, Ricky Jackson, and Brian Johnson

Verse 1

In the morning when I rise to meet You
In the morning when I lift my eyes
You're the only One I wanna cling to
You're the first thought on my mind 

Chorus
 
Let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with Heaven’s song 
Singing out an endless alleluia 

Verse 2

In the moments where You go unnoticed
In the ordinary day to day
Countless miracles of life around us
Point like arrows to Your name

Bridge

Only a moment to live this life
Like shooting stars burning up the night
Till Heaven’s opened and we arrive
In Your presence Lord
In Your presence

Verse 3

In the evening when I lay my head down
In the evening when I close my eyes
You're still the only One I wanna cling to 
You're the last thought on my mind

Hi Everyone! 
Welcome to another ""Cheat day!"" In this video, to celebrate 300,000 subscribers I  decided to eat 30,000 calories of JUST fast food (based off the poll that was posted a few months ago). Not just fast food, but my fast food FAVORITES! That's right.. KFC, Mcdonalds, Jack in The Box, and so on! 

This video was insane! Be sure to give a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and share with your friends!

The US war in Afghanistan has raged for 16 years, since the US invaded after 9/11, in 2001. At the onset, a centerpiece of US strategy was to rebuild Afghanistan's crumbling infrastructure. This move expedited military logistics and maneuvers, while simultaneously reigniting travel between Afghanistan's major cities. But when the US started its war in Iraq, that diverted resources and manpower from the battlefield of Afghanistan. And the Taliban didn't miss the chance.  To date, the most ambitious roadbuilding project, known as the Ring Road, has seen over $3 billion spent on its renewal. And it was never completed.

There were definitely a few memorable moments from Justin’s halftime show at this year’s super bowl, starting with his unusual way of opening the show.

Justin kicked off his halftime performance in an off-stage concert setting, launching into his latest song “Filthy”, off his new “Man of the Woods” album”.


Justin then moved onto the mainstage and went into a medley of his earliest hits, from “Cry Me a River” to “Sexy Back”.

By the end of the show, Justin took to the crowd to dance with one fan who was clearly more interested in getting a selfie with JT than he was participating in the moment, which lead to the most hilarious moment of the show…

Of course, one question on everyone’s mind was would Janet Jackson return to share the stage with Justin, after their infamous #NippleGate at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show. Controversially, Justin performed the song, “Rock Your Body”, at this year’s show, but cut out the song before the infamous, “gonna have you naked by the end of this song” line.

And clearly, Janet wasn’t invited to the party. Janet  previously denied rumors that she would join JT on the NFL stage once again, Tweeting QUOTE, “To put to rest any speculation or rumours as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow: I will not. Thank you for your support and I do look forward to seeing you all very soon.” Of course, many of us were still hoping Janet would return because, as we all know, it took two to make nipplegate happen, and she more than deserved to be there tonight.

The show still went on, of course, and Justin rounded out his halftime performance with his 2016 hit from the film Trolls, “Can’t Stop the Feeling”.

And just when you thought you’d gotten that one out of your head…

As turnt as the crowd dancing around Justin seemed, one Twitter user pointed out that the enthusiasm was way more subdued in the stadium during the show…

Just proves that Justin really should have asked Janet to help him bring sexy back.

One memorable moment we were all expecting from this halftime show was a hologram of the late Prince. Prince had close ties with Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as the Vikings football team, so when rumors swirled that JT was planning on featuring a Prince hologram during his halftime performance, we were expecting it to happen. But, it turns out that a tribute featuring a hologram is something the Purple Rain singer would NOT have wanted.

Prince previously told Guitar World of being made into a hologram in 1998 QUOTE, “That's the most demonic thing imaginable...Everything is as it is, and it should be. If I was meant to jam with Duke Ellington, we would have lived in the same age. That whole virtual reality thing...it really is demonic. And I am not a demon.”

Okay, so that’s a pretty good reason for JT to not perform with a hologram of Prince at tonight’s show. But that didn’t stop Justin from performing alongside a giant projection of Prince as he sang the late singer’s hit, “I would die for you”.

A slew of Prince fans took to twitter to protest JT’s move, with 90s icon Sinbad writing QUOTE, “Okay punkass justin Timberlake. You was cool till you pulled that Prince bullshit. You dissed Prince on a track of yours and you dissed him onstage when you lowered the mic stand onstage when prince  won an award. Later for ya ass”, while another user wrote QUOTE, “...to bring out Prince to improve this mediocrity is a damn embarrassment. I’m fumin #HalftimeShow”.

Okay, so it’s pretty obvious that Justin’s halftime show wasn’t an all-out smash for most people, but now I wanna hear what you guys think? Was JT’s performance totally mediocre, or did you love taking a trip down memory lane with his medley of hits? And what did you think of his Prince tribute? Sound off with all your thoughts in the comments below, and after that click right over here to hceck out Pink’s performance of the National Anthem.

Here is what you'll need!

Adding Storage Space In Your Small Living Room

1. Hidden remote storage
Keep your remotes from cluttering your living room by hiding them under your coffee table. Attach one side of a velcro strip to the back of your remotes and the other half to the underside of your coffee table.

2. Make a simple side table
Upcycle a crate as a cute but functional side table. Store things like extra pillow, blankets and books in the lower shelf, and use the top as a convenient table top surface.

3. DIY Rope basket

Materials
Cardboard box
Twine
Hot glue
Large pillow case

Instructions
1. Ensure the bottom of the cardboard box is secure. If necessary, add tape. Push the flaps of the box inside to create and open box.
2. Starting at the bottom of the box, apply a small amount of hot glue and attach the end of the twine. Carefully add lines of hot glue to box and attach the twine, working upwards. Continue to loop twine around the box until it’s a few inches away from the top.
3. Cuff a pillowcase halfway down or until you reached the desired size for the lining of your box.
4. Line the box with the pillowcase, covering the exterior cardboard.

4. Finally get board games organized
Tidy up your board games and puzzles by stacking them in pot organizers.

5. File holder shelf
Turn a wooden file holder into a shelf by drilling it sideways into a corner wall. Use your new makeshift shelves for magazines, remote controls, extra blankets, or knick knacks if you're tight on space and want some custom storage space.

6. DIY sofa table

Materials
1 plank wood, equal to length of couch
4 staircase spindles cut to height of couch
8 “L” brackets
Jigsaw
Sanding paper
Wood stain
1 extension outlet

Instructions
1. Place the outlet on one of the ends of the plank and trace the perimeter.
2. Use your jigsaw to cut out that square you traced.
3. Use the L brackets to attach the 4 “legs” (spindles) to your table.
4. Stain or paint the entire table.
5. Once dry, put the outlet into the hole you made in the plank. It should be tight enough that the outlet does not fall through.

7. DIY Wine Crate Coffee Table

Materials
4 wine crates
1 square peg board (27""x27"" or the size of your table)
4 6-inch table legs
Wood glue
Clamps
Strong tape
Sandpaper
Wood stain (optional)

Instructions
Arrange four wooden crates together on their sides, with the openings facing out (creating shelving).
There should be a small empty space at the center. Glue the sizes together with wood glue, and secure with tape until dry. Cover the top with wood glue, and lay the peg board down, clamping it into place.
Place a ring of wood glue on the tops of each table leg, and push them into the corners of the peg board. Let dry overnight.
Sand down all corners and edges of your table. Wipe away dust with a damp cloth. If desired, you can add two coats of stain to give it a finished look, or to match other furniture.
Enjoy you new coffee table!

8. DIY Convertible Storage Cube Seat
SUPPLIES
4 18x18 planks, 1-inch thick
2 16x18 planks, 1-inch thick
Wood glue

INSTRUCTIONS
Assembling The Cube
1. Make the perimeter of your cube by using wood glue to attach two 18x18 planks and two 16x18 planks. Once the wood glue is dry, reinforce the glued areas with nails every 2 inches.
2. Apply glue to the edges to the wood and place a 18x18 plank on top. Once the wood glue is dry, reinforce with nails.
3. Sand down the entire cube.
4. Wipe off any debris left from sanding.
5. Prime, stain and seal the wood.
6. Screw 4 wheels to the bottom of the cube.

Creating The Cube Lid
1. Repeat steps on a separate 18x18 plank.
2. Create a seat cushion by using spray adhesive to attach a 16x16 piece of foam to a ¼-inch thick piece of wood.
3. Upholster the cushion with durable fabric and a staple gun.
4. Map out a 16x16 space in the center of the 18x18 piece of wood.
5. Sand slightly, wipe away the excess shavings, and add glue the upholstered cushion to the 16x16 space on the lid. Allow 24 hours to fully dry",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMEIJxJ_Clw/sddefault.jpg,0.011483611585666294,0.00043868084108804084,26.1776,8.352483214316298e-05,0.011922292426754338,0.0120058172588975,2018-02-01,18:00:34,Thursday,3,11,16,10,16,49,165,0,43,1,1,10,13,3,0,4.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.800517446451337,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'bowl': 1},1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marrying into the royal family is a lot more than just high tea and hanging out with corgis. There are a ton of rules you need to follow, and they start from the moment you get engaged. Meghan Markle has a reputation for being a bit of a free spirit, but she’ll have to follow some pretty strict wedding traditions in May. Like she will have to be okay with Queen Elizabeth sending out all of her wedding invitations! What else will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have to expect? Well, fruitcake at the reception for one thing! We’ll also explore the history behind some of these surprising and seemingly crazy rules. Like why a Roman Catholic bride would raise eyebrows, or why royal brides must wear white. Some seemingly mundane wedding traditions such as the bouquet and the wedding bands actually have deep meaning for the members of the royal family.

Practice Notes 44 | Improvising in the Style of Bach

Today I thought I would share with you a full play-through of one of my favorite pieces by J.S. Bach, his Prelude and Fugue in C Major from WTC Book II.  I then show examples of how I would take a few measures of Bach and improvise in a way that mimics his style.  This is a practice I have been doing recently to get more familiar with his language, and it's a neat way to get to know the harmonic progressions he uses.

With climate change warming the Arctic at an alarming rate, the permafrost is beginning to thaw. While this phenomenon can wreak havoc on infrastructure and transportation in places like Northern Alaska and Siberia, the real danger is the release of carbon and methane gas. There are more greenhouse gases trapped in these deep layers of permafrost than all human fossil fuel emissions released since the industrial age. Due to permafrost thaw, that trapped carbon is starting to escape into the atmosphere, creating a warming feedback loop that will make climate change even worse, and cause the permafrost to thaw even faster. If this continues unchecked, scientists warn we could be on the verge of awakening "" the sleeping giant"" of climate change.



But some innovative climate pioneers are changing that. With the use of both cutting edge genetics, and an experiment that relies on geo-engineering, there is hope that the permafrost thaw can be slowed. VICE Correspondent, Ben Anderson, travels across the Arctic to see the devastating impact of thawing permafrost, and the astonishing solution that might keep it frozen.

The Great Shangqing Palace was the primary place of worship for a popular Taoist sect in China.

Located in southeast China, the temple was built during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and burned to the ground in 1930. For many years the temple’s exact location was unknown. It’s the largest excavation ever conducted for a Chinese Taoist site. Pottery and other ancient artwork were also uncovered during the excavation. Archaeologists plan to piece together exactly when the temple was constructed and the cultural climate in which it was built.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XQMY8pas-74/sddefault.jpg,0.0127914789836498,0.00024886145882587157,51.4,0.0005723813552995048,0.013040340442475672,0.01361272179777518,2018-03-27,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,8,39,8,34,46,345,0,79,0,1,7,18,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.350184788719362,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",4

※ 시럽 끓일 때 머랭이 충분히 올라오지 않으면 시럽을 넣어도 단단한 머랭이 만들어지지 않습니다.  이탈리안 머랭을 단단히 올리기 힘들다면 흰자 거품올릴 때 설탕 15g 정도를 추가해 보세요 :) 

※ 마카롱 건조시에 건조시간이 중요한게 아니라 ""건조된 상태""가 중요해요! 날씨, 실내 습도 온도에 따라 건조시간이 확연히 달라지니 영상에서 보여주고 있는 ""건조된 상태""로 확인해주세요 꼭!!!

※ 마카롱을 구울땐 같은 온도로 쭉 구워도 상관없지만 꼬끄색이 구운색이 나면 온도를 내려서 굽는게 좋아요.

※ 윌튼 식용색소는 인터넷에 검색해주세요.

※ 마카로나쥬를 너무 많이하면 반죽이 묽어져요. 그렇게 되면 건조도 안될 뿐더러 팬닝하면 반죽이 퍼져버려요.
주걱으로 들어올렸을 때 반죽이 계단접히듯 떨어지는 상태를 확인해주세요.

※ 채널 검색창에 '아리키친 마카롱' 이라고 검색하시면 마카롱 영상들이 쭉 나와요 ~ 참고해보세요 :)

Also, I want you to keep in mind that I am well aware that the patchiness comes from the patted on shadow vs the matte shadow over it, but I have done my eyeshadow this way with 200 other palettes with ZERO issues until it comes to Subculture & Prism.

The Tesla Model 3 is upon us, and it’s already being heralded by many as the most important car in decades.
Cost Calculator: http://geni.us/Model3CostCalc

But whether you’re one of the nearly half a million people who have already given Tesla a $1000 deposit, or someone who is wondering if it just makes financial sense, this video is for you.

At $35,000 dollars, the Model 3 is the most affordable Tesla to date. And with its 220 mile range, 126 MPGe, and 0-60 time of 5.5 seconds, it’s proving to be quite the little EV that could.

Very enticing indeed.

But the primary question remains: What is the TRUE Cost of Owning a Tesla Model Three?

While the question is simple, the answer is not.

The devil is always in the details, and so we will take a look at a couple of other popular gas powered cars for comparison, and look at Total Cost of Ownership over 5 years.

We will also explain the ugly truth about MPGe, and tell you what we think is a better measurement.

And if you’re counting on the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit, we’ll talk about why you may not even qualify for it.

Lastly, we will provide you with some cost calculators to help you reach an educated conclusion, based on your specific situation, because where you live & how you drive, really does affect your bottom line.

Then we watched a little bit of the Muppets show in Liberty Square and head over to ride the Winnie the Pooh ride. We were also able to make a reservation at Be Our Guest for an hour later, which was cool! We rode Haunted Mansion while we waited for our reservation time and we even made it on The Little Mermaid ride before lunch too! We were able to do so much, it was awesome! We had lunch and give our thoughts on why we think Be Our Guest might not be worth it. We definitely recommend eating there for yourself if you can though so you can decide for yourself.

You've got me nervous to speak
So I just won't say anything at all
I've got an urge to release
And you keep tellin' me to hold on
You've got me nervous to move
So I just won't give anything to you
You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

The area we are going to talk about today is shrouded in secrecy, and for that reason it has become the focus of conspiracy theorists. Is it a hiding place of aliens and weather control technology, or it is merely a location where the USA develops highly advanced military machinery? It is often referred to as a “Black Site” where “Black Projects” take place, with black basically meaning, “highly classified.” Today we’ll look at one of the most mysterious black sites in the world, in this episode of the Infographics Show, What Do We Know About Area 51?

Song - Pure Imagination
Composer - Bryan Nguyen
Artist - Ghostwriter Music feat. Merethe Soltvedt

Lyrics (so you can sing along):

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

[Chorus]
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world?
There's nothing to it

[Verse 2]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free, if you truly wish to be

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world?
There's nothing to it

[Verse 3]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free, if you truly wish to be

We showed off the amazingly cheap but well made knives offered by gearbest.com in an earlier, non sponsored video - it must have worked well for that site as they now offered us sponsorship. 

They sent is eight folding knives we picked, and then we went ahead and build what probably is the world's first folding knife jousting machine...

Emmerson Mnangagwa had been a powerful and loyal member of Mugabe's inner circle - serving as justice minister, speaker of parliament and vice president, before he was fired earlier this month.

His sacking sparked the current political crisis.

Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons reports on the man nicknamed the “Crocodile”.

Investigators for the Houston SPCA get more than they bargained for when they are called in to assist police at a commercial dog breeding facility in Coryell County. There are more than two hundred Rottweilers on the premises including dozens of newborn puppies. What should be a routine seizure becomes a nightmare when a freak ice storm hits Texas and temperatures plummet to below freezing. As the Investigators attempt to round up the dogs the vets battle to keep the newborns alive. Inside the owners' home ammonia levels are so high that the local fire department has deemed the property unsafe to enter and the team has to don respirators and protective clothing to rescue more dogs trapped inside. Once the dogs are on safely on the vehicles the team faces an even more dangerous challenge. At the rear of the property are two mountain lions and two Bengal tigers.

Please call and calmly let them know your displeasure. 

Stupid cop tells me to pull over at the next intersection. Gets pissed when I do exactly that. Immediately starts barking unlawful orders.

I've been traveling this road over a 1000 times the past six years. 

Always set my cruise at about 4 mph over the limit because my phone sounds an alarm when I exceed the limit by more than 5 mph.

Cop claims I was going 65 in a 50. 

He is either lying or has faulty equipment. 

Speeding, yet another victimless crime the government uses to steal your money.

UnREAL is such an underrated show! Here are 5 reasons you should be watching it if you aren’t already! For one, you don’t have to be a fan of dating shows to enjoy it! Yes, “UnREAL” is about a fictional dating show, but what makes it worthy of your precious TV watching time is its well written characters and its ability to poke fun at the conventions of the reality TV genre. Another reason is that it has such a stellar cast! Starring Shiri Appleby and Constance Zimmer, these two are stars on screen. Hilarious, smart and badass, these women own it.

UNB (You and Boy), 팬들과 하나되기 위한 그들의 시작 (Begin)
유앤비의 성장기를 담은 1st Mini Album [BOYHOOD] 발매

UNB (유앤비) 가 데뷔 앨범 [BOYHOOD] 를 발매하며 2018년 가요계에 다시 한번 도전한다.
유앤비는 KBS2 '아이돌 리부팅 프로젝트 - 더 유닛' 에서 대중의 투표에 의해 만들어진 그룹으로
준, 의진, 고호정, 필독, 마르코, 지한솔, 대원, 기중, 찬으로 구성된 9인조 남자 그룹이다.

이들의 첫 번째 미니앨범은 소년 시절 이라는 뜻의 [BOYHOOD]. 총 6곡으로 구성된 이번 앨범은 무대 위에서 다시 한번 빛날 그날을 위해 6개월의 기간 동안 울고 웃으며 함께 성장 해온 멤버들이 유앤비라는 그룹으로 다시 태어나 도약한다는 의미를 담았다.

데뷔 앨범 이례적으로 더블 타이틀곡을 발표, 앨범에 대한 자신감을 나타내었다.

첫번째 타이틀 곡 “감각”은 R&B감성의 EDM트랙으로 ‘유앤비를 처음 만나는 리스너들의 잠들어있는 감각을 깨우고, 만족시켜 그들의 마음을 유앤비로 채우겠다’ 는 당찬 포부를 담아 중독성 있게 표현한 곡이다. 감성적이고 파워풀한 전개와 더불어 유앤비 만의 남자다운 섹시함도 느낄수 있는 것이 이 곡의 감상 포인트.
두번째 타이틀 곡 ""ONLY ONE""은 서정적이고 세련된 팝스타일의 곡으로, 멤버들의 호소력 짙은 보이스가 매력적으로 다가온다. 무엇보다 단순한 사랑이야기가 아닌, 그동안 자신들을 응원해준 팬들에게 전하고 싶은 말을 은유적으로 담아내었다.
이밖에도 유앤비 멤버들 전원 작사 참여로 이루어진 필독의 자작곡 “Ride with me”와 대원의 “믿어줘(Rebooting)” 등을 수록해 아티스트적인 면모도 발휘하였다. 

또 두편의 완성도 있는 뮤직비디오를 제작, 데뷔 앨범인 만큼 힘을 주었다. 
더유닛 부터 함께 해온 세계적으로 사랑 받는 K-POP 뮤직비디오를 다수 제작한 쟈니브로스의 홍원기 감독과 화려하고 트렌디한 연출 세계를 구축해온 하정훈 감독이 연출을 맡았다. 
감각에서는 잠에서 깨어나 새로운 감각과 조우하여 그들만의 새로운 아이덴티티로 다시 태어남 (reborn) 을, 온리원 에서는 그들을 가두고 있던 작은 세계에서 깨어나, 조금은 불확실하지만 끝을 향해 거듭 나아가며 최종 목적지를 가기 위해 노력하는 부활 (rebirth) 의 의미를 담았다.
언뜻보면 다른 스토리 이지만, 결국 하나인 셈이다. reborn 과 rebirth
유앤비도 마찬가지다. 기존의 그룹에서 유앤비 라는 그룹으로 다시 탄생하였고, 누구보다 화려한 부활을 꿈꾼다. 
빛나고 싶었던 이들의 특별하지 않았던 삶, 
다사다난했던 인생그래프와 더불어, 다양한 성장통을 앓아온 그룹도 없을것이다.
그동안 다른 꿈, 다른 길을 걸어왔던 이들이 모여 유앤비로 뭉쳤다. 이들의 노력이 어떠한 결과를 만들어 낼지 아무도 모른다. 하지만 한가지 확실한 건 누구보다 간절하고 원한다는 것이다. 
이제 첫 걸음을 뗀 유앤비. 그들의 BOYHOOD (성장기) 의 끝이 아름답길 바란다.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

""Anti-abortion students at Baylor University are accusing Tomi Lahren and Turning Point USA of censorship after the conservative talking head refused to answer questions about her pro-choice stance during the organization’s annual Student Action Summit.

Lahren, who famously came out as pro-choice during a May 2017 appearance on “The View,” appeared at the summit last Thursday—dodging questions about her controversial abortion stance and former NFL quarterback Colin Kapernick.

According to a tweet from Baylor University student Chloe Knox, when she attempted to ask Lahren about protecting “unborn children,” Turning Point USA staff members said the famously “pro-free speech” firebrand would not be taking such questions.”*

The characters are a big part of the theme park experience but over the years, there have been some weird and interesting characters in the parks. The 90's at Walt Disney World, especially at MGM Studios were a much different time and when you take a took back at Disney theme park history, you'll find these extinct characters. From The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the weird disappearance of Roger Rabbit, and the Magical World of Barbie at Epcot, there was no shortage of weird characters.

Announcement about MORE HOODIES coming NEXT WEEK!

For two years, one mystery has continued to linger over the FNAF franchise -- what was in the box? In FNAF 4, the final image is a locked box with the message ""Some things are best left forgotten for now."" But with the series over, now is the time to answer...WHAT WAS IN IT? Well, it's not all that easy to answer. Because it's my theory, my FNAF theory, that the contents of the box have changed three times. So what was meant to be in FNAF 4's box vs what ended up in it when the credits rolled in FNAF 6? I think we've already seen the solution!

A war has been waged against one of the most notorious pest ants in the entire world: pharaoh ants! Today we embark on a mission to eliminate a colony of pharaoh ants that have broken into my home and into our ant farm terrarium, where they endanger our pet ants, the Titans (Marauder ants, Carebara diversa).  Watch how I deal with the pests in a way that is eco-friendly and pesticide-free. 

What we discover about pharaoh ants in this video will blow your mind, and just a hint: the ending will surprise you! Enjoy!

Special thanks to Alex Wild of http://www.alexanderwild.com who allowed us to use his beautiful images of pharaoh ants. Be sure to visit his website to order prints of his nature photographs.

Its a win/win. You can also TEXT 'jerryrig' to 500-500 and get it that way.

This is the most dangerous cell phone case I have ever tested... and it hurts! I would suggest staying away from the metal prongs... Here is the current pricing for the Stun Gun iPhone case: http://amzn.to/2GkX9vV there are a few different colors too. If you need personal protection and this kind of thing is legal where you live, it might be the perfect solution. Even the sound alone might demotivate potential villains.

This case is illegal in 5 states currently, and you need a concealed weapons permit in several other states in order to have one of these stun gun cases. So make sure to check your own states regulations regarding stun guns, and Tazers.

Most thought Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks were a thing of the past after CPU vendors introduced IOMMUs and OS vendors blocked Firewire DMA. At least until the PCILeech direct memory access attack toolkit was presented a year ago and quickly became popular amongst red teamers and governments alike.

A year later the situation has improved but some firmware and operating systems still remain vulnerable by default. The hardware used to perform the attacks was however limited both in capabilities and supply. FPGA support was introduced and made available to the public to overcome these problems. In this talk I will subvert kernels, defeat full disk encryption and spawn system shells - all by using affordable publically available FPGAs and open source software!

CHECK IT OUT HERE: https://herguideto.teachable.com/

Alright you guys, it´s been one year since I posted my last spring clean my room video, and I´m super excited to be sharing with you guys 8 NEW DIY´s to help you organize your room! First off ill be sharing my favorite way to tackle the messy floor-dirty-clothes problem, which is by creating a DIY laundry basket! Afterwards, I´ll share with you my very cluttered and messy dresser surface, which has so much potential! Therefore I´m in this video showing you how I DIY some organizational triangle boxes which double up as both bookstands and a place to put all my washi tapes, duck tapes, and acrylic paints! 

Further on to decorate this area, I added a DIY gold pen holder, as well as a glass marble stand with gold mini jars where I store all the smaller hard-to-organize things in my room! However what about the bigger stuff? Of course, I´ll show you how to make stylish and super cute wooden boxes which you can hide whatever you want in! To spice up the area over my bed, and organize all my thoughts and memories I DIY´ed an amazing pinboard! It´s super easy and affordable to make, and would look great in every color! And lastly, this video includes a lot of cleaning, folding, fast-motion organizing and a bit of humor, ENJOY!

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

When we love a star, we want to know everything about them. What their favorite food is, where they like to go shopping, what their middle name is, pretty much anything that will give us more insight into their lives. Well, if Dua Lipa is one of your favorite new singers, you don’t have to go very far to find out more about her. Here are 20 Things That You Didn’t Know About Dua Lipa.

For starters, she loves to watch &quot;Gossip Girl.&quot; In fact, in an interview with Buzzfeed, she even called the show her guilty pleasure. We don’t know why she would want to hide this though; &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; was a great show!

She moved out of her parent’s house when she was only 15! This may be part of the reason why she comes across as such a rebel now. She has never really been one to follow the rules and has been fending for herself since her teenage years. She is definitely not a girl to be messed with.

She also gets embarrassed, just like the rest of us. One time right before she went on stage to perform in Berlin she found out that she had a huge rip in her pants. She has said that was probably one of her most embarrassing moments. See, she is just like us!

Whether it’s her tattoos, her place of birth, or her favorite drink, there are lots of things that you didn’t know about Dua Lipa. Stay tuned to 20 Things You Didn’t Know About Dua Lipa to find out which famous singer she went to the same school as.

And see some interviews with John Boyega (Jake, and Finn from Star Wars), Scott Eastwood (Nate), Cailee Spaeny (Amara), Charlie Day (Dr. Geiszler) and Burn Gorman (Dr. Gottlieb) on their new movie.
The globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising.
John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave his life to secure humanity’s victory against the monstrous “Kaiju.” Jake has since abandoned his training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction.
Jake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale.
Pacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day.

It doesn’t mean your life is doomed and that you will never find yourself again. It simply means you are going through an incubation period and transformation. The key is not to get stuck in your current lost state and to tap into your creative power to create a life you love.

Here are seven tips that will help you out of this lost state and remind you of the power you have to create a life you love.

1. Remember what you love to do and go do it! Do you remember the last time you had fun in your life? Do you remember when things felt easy and in the flow? It was likely because you were fully engrossed in the fun of the moment. As we grow up, we lose sight of how amazing life can be because we feel burdened by the responsibilities and mundane parts of life. It’s time to reconnect with what you love and to take action on it. No more excuses about not having the time, money, resources, babysitter etc. Make a commitment to do what you love and watch your life change before your very eyes.

2. Go on an adventure. Whether it’s a day trip, a solitary retreat, or a week-long drive along the coast, go out and explore the world. This will not only allow you to tap into the flow, but it will also give you the time and focus to really reconnect with yourself again. You’ll be away from the noise of your regular life and will be able to see and experience the world with fresh eyes. I promise, when you come back you will have far more clarity about where you are going than you had when you started.

3. Reconnect with your dreams and dream BIG. What kinds of dreams did you have for your life before you lost yourself in the busy-ness of life? What have you since deemed impossible or improbable because of where you are today? Grab a journal and reconnect with the dreams you once had and better yet, come up with some new dreams. In a perfect world, what would you love to be, have, or do? What is your soul aching for? Once you reconnect with your dreams, you’ll have the desire and inspiration to begin to take action and suddenly you will have found yourself again.

4. Expand your comfort zone regularly. It’s time to get uncomfortable by trying new things and meeting new people. Growth doesn’t happen by staying in your bubble of comfort where everything is familiar. Challenge yourself to do something that is slightly terrifying, yet invigorating. That is what I like to call the zone. It’s the space where you are stretching yourself just enough to continue to grow and evolve. What’s the first thing that came to mind for you? Go do that!

5. Get quiet and listen. Everyday there are signs, messages, and guideposts that will inspire you to act, but you only notice them if you are open. With all the mind chatter and busy-ness we have these days it can be difficult to recognize the signs that are all around, so it’s important to get quiet and listen. Pay attention to the signs on the road, songs on the radio, and the people you meet in the street. There are messengers all around with Divine guidance to help you move forward on your path. Your key to finding yourself may very well be on a billboard or come to you as a thought in the shower. Listen up, pay attention, and then follow through on your inspired action.

6. Remember you have the power to be, have, and do anything you desire. Sometimes the feeling of being lost is all-consuming and you forget that you get to choose what you think and how you feel. You are given a great amount of power to create the life you desire and get the answers you are looking for. Whether you use affirmations, mantras, meditation, yoga, journaling or something else, it’s important to focus on the beauty and joy around you. When you do that, the Universe sends you more of the same, including the answers you are seeking.

7. Ask for help. There are so many people in the world whose purpose it is to help people like you. Reach out and ask for help. You don’t have to figure this out all on your own and sometimes simply having a chat with someone can provide the insight you need to move forward with ease. Whether it’s a life coach, mentor, friend, counselor, or the Divine, ask for help and be open to the guidance and tools that come your way.

Let’s keep the conversation going. What has helped you find yourself when you were feeling lost? Share in the comments below, I’d love to hear your input.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xjq_ow5DrWY/sddefault.jpg,0.01398356057760272,0.0007667520832782969,18.23739495798319,0.0006233887735897077,0.014750312660881018,0.015373701434470725,2017-12-04,13:00:04,Monday,0,14,43,13,35,79,407,4,82,0,0,11,0,4,1,5.0,8.0,['©) TONY ROBBINS'],"['©)', 'TONY', 'ROBBINS']",True,"['©', ')', 'toni', 'robbin']",4,4,12,1,0,0,0,6.598207432295967,1,['surprised'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,{'person': 1},1

The 24th Annual SAG Awards celebrated the best acting of 2017. But the fashion celebrated new trends of 2018. Millie Bobby Brown kicks off our list of Best Dressed stars, wearing a high-low Calvin Klein halter dress paired with white Converse! But that’s not all, Millie completed the playful look with mini buns adorned with long black bows.

Dakota Fanning was a total dream in this strapless nude gown with rhinestone beading along the edges. Next on our list is Margot Robbie wearing a feathered and embellished Miu Miu gown. Yup, we think Tonya Harding would approve.

Now, a look that we are LIVING for tonight is Queen Susan Sarandon. Her off-shoulder sequin gown is stunning, but her sunglasses turned her into a total stunner. Moving on to Dascha Polanco, who looked like an ethereal goddess in this beige beaded halter gown paired with gorgeous mermaid hair.

Mandy Moore brought some color to the carpet in this simple blue gown. And our main question after seeing this is: does this girl age?! Another ageless beauty on our list is Reese Witherspoon who showed us how to glam up GREEN on the red carpet. And if you ever wondered if it was possible for Halle Berry to look bad, wonder no more because the answer is a solid NO. Halle is glowing in this curve-hugging gold sequin gown adorned with LOTS black tulle.

Next up is the rest of the Stranger Things cast- who showed off their personalities in shades of black, white, and green velvet. Last but not least is the show’s first ever host Kristen Bell, wearing a strapless magenta gown with floral beading. After seeing this wide spectrum of looks, we’re dying to know which was your favorite from the SAG Awards red carpet? Put those comments below, and then click here for a full recap of the night’s big winners! As always I’m your host Sinead de Vries, thanks for hanging out with Clevver.

But in 2018 could the war of words between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump spiral into nuclear catastrophe?

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2AAPWW3

In April 2018, North Korea will hold a national celebration to mark the birthday of the country's founding ""eternal president"" Kim Il Sung. But 2018 will also mark another milestone. North Korea will have nuclear missiles that can reach American soil.

We'll see an alarming game of nuclear brinkmanship between two of the world's most hot-headed leaders, Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.

As the crisis comes to a head, will 2018 bring cold war or nuclear disaster?

Communist North Korea is a secretive state of 25m people. Increasingly, North Koreans are fleeing the tyrannical regime. Thae Yong Ho is one of the highest-ranking officials to defect to the West. He has unique insight into the inner workings of Mr Kim's government and its nuclear ambition.

The country is already believed to have the means to deliver nuclear warheads at short and medium range. In 2017, with the world watching, Mr Kim successfully tested his long-range missile.

In 2018 he will perfect and demonstrate the ability to fit a nuclear weapon on a missile and fly it all the way to the American mainland. San Francisco and Los Angeles will be in its reach.

The road ahead will be defined by the pugnacious personalities of Mr Kim and Mr Trump. North Korea has long been known for hurling insults at world leaders. Mr Kim has described Mr Trump as a ""mentally derange US dotard"" by responding to the taunts with equally provocative language.

Played out in public, the war of words is unprecedented. The so-called ""rocket man"" is often ridiculed in the West but he's proven himself to be calculating and callous.

Despite the bluster and posturing there is nothing to suggest either leader wants to go to war. In 2018, Donald Trump must choose between military action and diplomacy. China is key to Mr Trump's diplomatic route. As a supplier of virtually all North Korea's oil, China could curb Mr Kim's behaviour.

But so far China has been reluctant to intervene because it wants to avoid the collapse of the regime which could result in a unified Korea, with American troops on China's border.

There is a chance, however remote, that in the year ahead, America could order pre-emptive surgical strikes against North Korea's nuclear-missile facilities.

The impact of an American military intervention would have devastating consequences. North Korea has vast conventional artillery at the ready. North Korea would retaliate by firing missiles already positioned to hit Seoul, South Korea's capital.

The megacity of ten million people is only 56km from the North's border.

America has 28,000 troops South Korea. President Trump is capable of deploying cruise missiles, submarines and carriers within hours. Kim Jong Un would reach for his stockpile of chemical, biological and eventually nuclear weapons. The death toll would rise into the millions until American and South Korean forces eventually overwhelm the North Korean military.

But war is 2018 is unlikely. The North Korean leader may be pushing the limits of inflammatory behaviour but there is no evidence that he is irrational.

The appropriate response from America should not be military bravado but old fashioned cold-war deterrence and containment.

In the year ahead, America and China should increase pressure on North Korea with tougher sanctions. In 2018, the world can avoid catastrophe.

THE DAY HAS COME!! Its time to lift my brand new 2018 Toyota Tacoma. This baby is less than 3 months old and has 6000 miles on the current suspension. And its time to do some upgrading.

This Icon Vehicle Dynamics lift kit is adjustable and adds about 3 inches of lift in both the front and the rear tires. Which is perfect for my use. Usually when you add more than 3 inches, you have to do some adjustments to the drive train and gearing. And I aint about that life. I just want some extra inches of height and a smoother ride off road, so the 3 inches Icon offers is perfect.

This video will show the basics of the lifting process for all Tacomas 2016 and after... (Until the next model comes out.)

Let me know if you have any questions! Automotive stuff is pretty fun. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROJECT!! ONLY ATTEMPT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ATTEMPT ON A WHIM. IT LOOKS EASY ON CAMERA, CAN VERY EASILY DESTROY A VEHICLE IF DONE WRONG. Or you know... kill you. Try to avoid doing that.

Heizle's DIY Bangs video: http://bit.ly/2inwHrm 

This makeup tutorial was heavily inspired by Stylenanda/3CE. I checked out the site recently and fell in love with the Mood Recipe campaign photos!! such a Concept. I did use a lot of Korean makeup products in this video as well, I got a bunch of new things recently so I wanted to try them out! 

I've been watching a lot of beauty videos and tried to combine different styles of editing for this video. There's always room to improve and I haven't been branching out of my comfort zone so I decided to do it today ^^ This editing style is definitely more time-consuming but lmk if you like it!

Oh and I got a new camera lens! I'm sooooooooo excited to use it, I did use it to film a few of the product clips in this video but I can't wait to see how it works with a full video~~~~

This is probably going to be my last video before Thanksgiving so I just wanted to quickly let you know how grateful I am for YOU! feeling extremely blessed this Thanksgiving. Wishing you all stay safe and warm this holiday season ♡

♡ xo

Lyrics
I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on
I keep lettin' you back in (lettin' you back in)
How can I, explain myself?
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me (Lil Weezyana shit)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me (Murda on the beat)
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me (A song for y'all to cut up to, you know?)
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me (yeah)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (alright!)
It's a short life, yeah
You said you'd die for me, care for me, care for me
You said you care for me, care for me, care for me
Said you'd be there for me, cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me, give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta, be nice for what, to these niggas?
I understand
You got a hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright
It's a short life
Uh-huh! (Oh yeah!)
These hoes! (They hate!)
Your boy! (Today!)
I may! (Watch the breakdown)
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta
Gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta, gotta make that jump, jump (let's go)
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up (Make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up (Make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, over, over, over, over (Make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, lift it up (Make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, lift it up (Make that jump, jump)
That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be, nice for what, to these niggas?
I understand
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd cry for me
Gotta hit the club like you hit them, hit them, hit them angles
It's a short life
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Did you hear? The XFL is coming back! Vince MacMahon has announced he will relaunch the extreeeeeme option to the NFL in 2020. So, what everyone is wondering is...which cities and teams will be involved?  The same Original Eight as before, or locations that are completely new?

I hypothecize expansion to 32 teams, with the following rules:

1) Focus on cities without current teams in the NFL or any other professional league, and
2) Cities whose metropolitan area population exceeds 4 Million people and currently feature an NFL franchise may still be considered.

So, New York-New Jersey, you're safe.

I leave it up to all of you to come up with the team names!

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

Dan Lok, a.k.a. The King of High-Ticket Sales is one of the highest-paid and most respected consultants in the luxury and “high-ticket” space. 

Dan is the creator of High-Ticket Millions Methodology™, the world's most advanced system for getting high-end clients and commanding high fees with no resistance. 

Dan works exclusively with coaches, consultants, thought leaders and other service professionals who want a more sustainable, leveraged lifestyle and business through High-Ticket programs and Equity Income.

Dan is one of the rare keynote speakers and business consultants that actually owns a portfolio of highly profitable business ventures. 

Not only he is a two times TEDx opening speaker, he's also an international best-selling author of over 12 books and the host of Shoulders of Titans show. 

Dan's availability is extremely limited. As such, he's very selective and he is expensive (although it will be FAR less expensive than staying where you are). 

Many of his clients are seeing a positive return on their investments in days, not months.

But if you think your business might benefit from one-on-one interaction with Dan, visit http://danlok.com

Lyrics:
Stockings are hung with care
The children sleep with one eye open
Now there's more than toys at stake
'Cause I'm older now but not done hoping
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
Old saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night
A cheer that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
Let's cozy on up our fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that you would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving I'm here I'm yours
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'm wearin' our Christmas sweater
While talking to the mistletoe tonight
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving I'm here I'm yours

Being transgender isn't easy at all. Those who go through transitioning have to go through a rough period to become who they truly want to be. And it doesn't get any easier once the transition is over. They still have to deal with ignorance and transphobia every day. However, there are more and more transgender celebrities who are publicly coming out to fight for the rights of trans people everywhere. If you want to see who some of our favorite ones are, check out our video on 10 Transgender Celebrities We All Admire.

From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted the beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters.

Iseult Gillespie shares how one such unnerving transformation befell the spinner Arachne.

Cockroachella: One of the many possible names we could name this brand new natural reconstruction of a jungle habitat and ground scape for my colony of feeder Dubia cockroaches. In this video, we explore what makes cockroaches unique, their important role in the ecosystem, and how understand them allowed us to create a new home of practical value for humans. We also watch why their old home was insufficient and why caring for feeder insects is extremely important.

Lyrics:

Chorus

no thoughts
no prayers
can bring back whats no longer there
the silent
are damned
the body count is on your hands

Verse 1

smile for the camera
another politician bought
i swear i heard another shot
cash another payment
red all on the canvas
it’s murder on the campus
another press conference
nothing gets accomplished
the suit is an accomplice
money is the motive
the war is in the street
watch history repeat

Chorus x 3

Verse 2

they lobby for the violence
it’s a governmental shakedown
welcome to my breakdown
bulletproof backpacks
they wanna arm the teachers
i think i saw the reaper
fear is good for profit
deregulate the casket
they’re lying to the masses
how much will it take
till you get buried in the coffin that you make heavens sake

Chorus x 3

Bridge

turn off all the lights
no body make a sound
ashes to ashes
we all fall down
are we out of time
can we turn this all around
are we out of time
will we all fall
all fall down

on your hands, on your
on your hands, on your hands

Outro Chorus

no thoughts (no thoughts)
no prayers (no prayers)
no thoughts (no thoughts)
the body count is on your hands

no thoughts (no thoughts)
no prayers (no prayers)
no thoughts (no thoughts)
the body count is on your hands

On Thursday night, Elon Musk rolled out Tesla's biggest gizmo yet: a fully electric semitruck. The Semi can go a whopping 500 miles between charges, hauling 80,000 pounds along the way. And it can sorta, kinda drive itself—on highways, anyway. The truck comes with Enhanced Autopilot, the second generation of Tesla's semiautonomous technology, equipped with automatic braking, lane keeping, and lane departure warnings.

After the Tesla CEO spent half an hour onstage extolling the virtues of his new electric 18-wheeler, he stepped away and the lights went out. Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage” came on the loudspeakers, and then the new Roadster rolled out of the very Semi he had just introduced, ripping around the massive lot where the trucks had been just a moment earlier.

Montreal duo Chromeo are electro funk legends, with a career that stretches back to 2002 and classics like 'Fancy Footwork' to their name. With a new single out and a fifth album on the way, we decided to pay a visit to their studio in Burbank, CA where they've been recording for the past year.

Here the duo walked us through the vintage synths that have shaped their sound, from the Juno-106 to the Elka Synthex. They also told us how Steely Dan inspired their studio location, gave us some insider tips on starting a synth collection and even recorded a FACT jingle. Watch it above.

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marrying into the royal family has no shortage of perks, like being able to pull off wearing a tiara. But there are also a lot of drawback that Meghan Markle will encounter once she marries Prince Harry. After the wedding, she won’t be able to do many things, including opening presents on Christmas day. We already know that she had to give up her Instagram, but she also had to give up her beloved dog, Bogart because of her new royal role. Meghan Markle was always outspoken when it came to politics, but now she’s going to be forced to keep her opinions to herself. And voting in elections is definitely going to be a thing of the past for this royal family member.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y17tpFh4sbY/sddefault.jpg,0.01318939086672994,0.0002135230589579053,61.77033492822967,0.00031313309842391377,0.013402913925687843,0.01371604702411176,2018-06-08,08:35:00,Friday,4,12,40,12,35,73,361,5,82,0,1,9,19,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.571620000091251,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

And what if I further told you that the film, directed by both Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon, was hit with numerous complaints about the terrible CGI that was used to hide Henry Cavill’s mustache. And what if I even further told you that Collider discovered the truth behind the decision to CGI the Big Blue Boy Scout’s mustache out of ‘Justice League’. Would you want to know the real truth? Could you handle knowing why this decision was made? And are you prepared to not look at superhero films the same way again?

We here at Collider have hired The Mustache Boys, a crack team of investigators specializing in follicle crime, to track down the truth of what happened to Cavill’s mustache. The Boys ask why it was CGI’d out instead of, ya know, just SHAVED OFF. They explore who stood to benefit from this decision. They interview the foremost mustache experts in the world. And they track down WB and DC executives behind this decision to learn the truth. The Boys go ALL IN to unravel the truth behind the mystery of “Superman’s ’Stache: The Follicle Fumble.” Watch the video and let us know what you think about these answers and if you’re satisfied by what The Mustache Boys were able to uncover.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4DOfwpRpgQ/sddefault.jpg,0.009242926856656264,0.00014738152163233222,62.714285714285715,0.00033219327098081233,0.009390308378288595,0.009722501649269407,2018-01-30,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,9,38,9,33,58,334,3,79,0,1,8,14,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.349504377726289,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Dale Cairns - There are some fans still in denial over the reveal about Rey's parentage, that for some reason believe that Kylo was the one who 'revealed' this information to Rey. The movie made it fairly clear that Rey already knew and Kylo (who had seen into Rey's mind learned this information) pushed Rey to face the truth. Also Maz says to Rey ""You already know the truth, they're never coming back""

TJ - Hi John and happy new year. My question for you today is which trailer do you think we will see first, “Solo: A Star Wars Story” or the second half of season 4 of Star Wars Rebels? Thanks and keep up the great work!

Joshua Toussaint - One of my least favorite moments in Phantom Menace was Anakin flying and saying, “Let’s try spinning. That’s a neat trick.” Then, in The Last Jedi, we saw Kylo spinning and firing in his TIE Fighter and it actually looked cool & now I don’t hate that scene in Episode 1 as much. Did you catch this subtle reference & what are your thoughts?

J Kircher - Hey John been watching since the AMC days what do you think about kylo ren and Rey's connection at the end of the last jedi. Some people say this suggests he will come back in 9. Could he know how to essence transfer like old sith?

RK - I have no issue with Rey being powerful in the force and being a no one as Anakin was. I also don't have any issues with her being good at fighting with a lightsaber as she is gifted/self-trained in combat her whole life. My issue is her doing things like the Jedi mind trick in TFA and using force pull so easily without any training. All the Jedi we've seen have had to train to use those skills.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4gwBfaqC-g/hqdefault.jpg,0.03586211949155647,0.00512839298142789,6.992857142857143,0.018608740246895492,0.04099051247298436,0.05959925271987985,2018-01-02,19:22:40,Tuesday,1,13,23,13,23,78,186,2,46,0,0,11,22,3,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.750080648784878,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'cow': 1, 'person': 1}",2

안녕하세요 녹차우유를 요청해주셔서 이번에 준비해본 우유입니다
저번 초콜릿우유에서 레시피를 조금만 바꿔서 준비했어요 

처음에는 녹차가루를 40g으로 하려고 했는데 계량 할 때 너무 많아보여서 30g으로 줄였어요
 30g이 제 입에는 딱 맞아요 좀 더 진한 맛을 원하시면 5~10g정도 추가해보셔도 되지만
일단 드셔보시고 정해주세요 (호불호가 약간은 있습니다 녹차&말차를 즐겨먹지 않는 분들은 가루 양을 조금 줄여서 만들어보세요)

초콜릿이 들어가 진하고 아주 맛있습니다 
오늘은 전자레인지로 간단하게 만드는 법을 알려드립니다
초코우유도 이렇게 만들어도 됩니다 

초코우유를 자주 만들어 마시는데 이 방법으로 들어요 완전 간단해요 :)
만든 우유는 하루내로 드세요 (양이 많으면 반으로 줄여 만들어보세요)

▶재료 (1L 정도의 분량)
말차가루(녹차가루) 30g, 설탕 40g, 물 50ml, 화이트 초콜릿 130g, 우유 800ml

1) 녹차가루, 설탕, 물을 볼에 담아 섞어줍니다
2) 화이트 초콜릿을 넣고 섞어줍니다
3) 전자레인지에 40초 정도 돌려줍니다 (600w 기준)
4) 재료들이 잘 섞이도록 한번 더 섞어줍니다
5) 우유를 조금씩 넣어가며 섞어줍니다
6) 체에 한번 걸러줍니다
7) 따뜻하게 마셔도 좋고 냉장실에 넣어 차게 마셔도 좋습니다 
+  만든 우유는 하루 내로 드세요

시청해주셔서 감사합니다

You will learn how to dye Easter eggs in various different ways. We will show you how to decorate your eggs with vegetables, shaving foam and hot glue.

We will also show you how to make your favorite emoji egg, mesmerizing galaxy eggs and other decorations for the holidays that you can easily make at home.

1. Stick tape around the egg, leave some empty space. Submerge your egg in dye. Hold it there for a couple of minutes. Repeat with different forms and colors.

2. Color your eggs using stockings and herbs. Place the herbs on the eggs, and wrap them in a stocking. Put the eggs in natural egg dye for 5-6 hours. 

3. To make emoji eggs, mix yellow egg dye with water in a bowl. Place your white boiled eggs in it. Use colorful markers to draw your favorite emoji!

4. Make galaxy eggs. Color the base of the egg with a blue dye. Add an extra layer to your egg with a sponge. Splash white paint on it with a toothbrush.

5. Decorate an egg with a glue gun. Submerge the egg in dye. After 15-30 mins pull out the egg. Peel off the glue and reveal beautiful ornaments (these eggs are not recommended for eating).

6. Cover your tray with shaving foam. Using a pipette, add color egg dyes, stir up a bit. Put your eggs in the tray and mix. Wash off the foam (these eggs are not recommended for eating).

7. Crack your boiled eggs, place them in a bowl with coloring mix for painting them from the inside. Stir for a bit. Peel the shell off to reveal your art!

8. Make a little twist by splashing some paint with a toothbrush over the colored egg. Extra details make them unique!

9. Make glow-in-the-dark eggs using core of a highlighter. Put the core and your egg in a glass. Fill it with water. Leave this overnight for an egg to absorb all the dye (DO NOT EAT).

10. Dye your eggs in pastel colors. Make a holder for your eggs. Soak your boiled eggs in vinegar, then place them on the holder. Apply food paint with a pipette and let the paint run down the sides.

11. Use plastic wrap to color your eggs! Apply your favorite natural egg color over the wrap. Carefully roll your egg inside it to give it some extra texture.

12. To make unique Easter eggs, pour some nail polish into the water, submerge your eggs in it for a second. Now each egg has its own style!

13. Color your eggs with aluminum foil by applying paint on the foil then crumpling it. After that insert an egg inside. Cover your egg with foil for the color to stick.

14. Boil blue cabbage until the water gets purple. Pour off the decoction into a separate dish. Oil an egg with a brush. Put it into the decoction. Wait for 15-30 minutes until it’s ready.

15. To make a mosaic Easter egg, you'll need an already colored egg. Peel the shell in medium size pieces. Now apply egg white on them, to make them stick on another egg.

16. Boil different veggies for different color: beetroot - red, onion - golden, purple cabbage - blue, turmeric - yellow. Pour the decoction into a glass, add some vinegar. Leave your eggs there for a while, depending on the color intensity you desire.

17. Use a pencil with an eraser to give additional details to your eggs. Just dip the eraser into food coloring and just polka dot your egg!

18. Make fancy eggs by coloring the bottom third of your egg. Draw a face for each egg and some fancy clothing using a marker! 

19. To make cute Easter bunny table decoration, bend a napkin in half from one corner to the other, roll it up, bend it, tie a knot to make bunny ears and a hole to fit an egg. Spray your egg with golden food color spray and draw a cute bunny face.

20.  Make a collage of newspapers on your Easter eggs. Cut out your favorite newspaper in pieces in various forms. Use egg white and a paintbrush to stick the paper over your eggs.

21. If you have any feathers around, you can just stick them on your egg with a paintbrush and egg white. Now you can feel like you are at your grandma’s countryside cottage!

22. Make blooming cacti decorations! Fill a small pot with soil and rocks. Take a green egg, draw patterns with markers. Bend a napkin, cut out a small circle from the intersection. Use a glue to stick this blossom to the top of your cactus-egg.

23. Use crayons on the HOT eggs to paint whatever ornaments you like. Heat will melt the crayon thus giving a nice texture.

24. Eat the egg without peeling off all the colorful shell to make a pot for your plants. Just fill the empty shell with soil and plant your plant!

25. Empty the insides of a boiled egg to make egg-shaped candles. Pour some melted wax and put a candle on top. Wait for the wax to cool off for about 20-30 minutes and peel off the shell.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

Checkout their YouTube channel for a  huge collection of exciting historical footage.

It was to fly even faster than the Concorde, at speeds approaching Mach 3. And even carry more passengers. It would have flown the distance from Los Angeles to New York in under two hours. America’s effort to build a supersonic airliner was an ambitious project spanning a decade and costing a billion in government funding. But even an army of aerospace engineers and the latest in aviation technology was not enough to get America’s Supersonic Transport (SST) off the ground. 

In 1962, the British and French announced a partnership to build the world’s first supersonic airliner, the Concorde. A few months later, the Soviets also jumped into the race with SST plans of their own supersonic airliner, the Tupolev 144. As America had watched these programs transform from concepts into serious enterprises, officials began to worry about maintaining America’s lead in civil aviation. 

So in 1962, President Kennedy announced that the U.S. government would help fund the development of an American supersonic transport. Manufacturers were invited to participate in a design competition. Design entries from Lockheed (L-2000) and North American Aviation (NAC-60) were reviewed. After years of evaluation, Boeing’s 2707 was selected as the winning design.

But it turns out that building an SST significantly faster and larger than the Concorde would be enormously challenging, requiring completely new aviation designs and technologies. As the 1960s wore on, the Boeing 2707 program was plagued by technical setbacks, and the program’s ambitious goals were not being met. An anti-SST movement had grown around opposition to sonic booms and other environmental concerns. 

When funding for the Boeing 2707 project was canceled in 1971, foreign competition and concerns about national prestige were not enough to offset political, economic and environmental pressures. The public’s view of government programs and optimism over technology had waned. Over the course of the 1960’s, the world had changed. #SST #Boeing2707 #Airplanes

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9hz-J_3-k8/sddefault.jpg,0.024610498927798985,0.00014357468706825328,171.41252006420547,0.0007287049125358218,0.024754073614867242,0.02548277852740306,2018-03-29,05:42:42,Thursday,3,9,44,9,39,50,374,3,88,0,1,7,23,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.119021149638402,3,"['happy', 'neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

mildly - trash countries. The ANC has described the comments as unacceptable. Speaking from East London ANC Deputy Secretary General Jesse Duarte says while African countries face difficulties the US also faces difficulties and the Trump's remarks are offensive.
At the same time, the Botswana Government has summoned the United States Ambassador to that country to express its displeasure at Trump comments. Botswana is expected to host a Congressional delegation from the USA at the end of January. It is demanding to know if Trump believes Botswana - which has welcomed US citizens is also included in his remarks. The government of Botswana says it puzzled why President Trump used derogatory terms to refer to countries that have had cordial relations with the USA for so many years. Botswana has further called on SADC, AU and other countries to condemn the remarks.

Gerard Adams, also known as The Millennial Mentor™, is a serial entrepreneur, angel investor, and philanthropist. His mission is to turn entrepreneurs into industry-recognized leaders while showing them how to create true impact and freedom through their business.

Gerard became a self-made multi-millionaire by 24, but lost it all during an economic downturn. However, that didn’t slow him down. He kept going and co-founded an online media publication called EliteDaily.com. Gerard helped EliteDaily.com grow to a readership of over 80 million visitors per month. And in 2015, he sold the platform to a multi-billion-dollar global corporation for $50,000,000.

Since then, he’s invested in, built, and backed 9 companies and trades that have all made seven figures. He’s lived bi-coastal, owned exotic cars, traveled the world first-class, and made friends with countless influencers. Although the material rewards were great, it inspired him to share what he had learned to help other purpose-driven entrepreneurs create the businesses they needed so they could serve the world on a higher level. This is how Leaders Create Leaders was born.

Jaden Smith's latest film is an auditory one, exploring the lyrical follies of a rich-kid-turned-mediocre-rapper in desperate need of perspective as he produces 70 minutes of egotistical propaganda in the hope it will launch his rap career.

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse. But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world. When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

#ReadyPlayerOne is the new science fiction movie by Steven Spielberg, starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Ben Mendelsohn. The script was written by Eric Eason.

Let's take a deep dive into why Hollywood doesn't seem to be as infatuated with Halle Berry as it used to be...

Here’s a simple eyesight test that will show how sharp your eyes are. 
We all know that “eyes are the windows to the soul.” Do your windows need cleaning, or are they crystal clear and give a sharp picture of the world? Take this test to find it out!

There will be 4 stages, and it will get harder and harder with every stage. The first one might seem like a piece of cake (and if you’re actually seeing a piece of cake we’ve got problems), but the further we go, the more concentration it will require. In fact, only 8 % of people can pass stage 4 because it is so hard.  

You will have the same task for every question in all the stages. The task is to pick 1 out of 10 colors which is different from the rest. To pass each of the stages, you have to find that odd one out in each task. If you fail once, you fail the entire stage.

SUMMARY
Congratulations to all superhumans out there who made it. Your eyesight is fantastic! 92% of people failed at this task, and you managed to rock it! 
There is a chance you are a tetrachromat. This smart word is used to define people who have more receptors in their eyes than others and can see more shades of different colors. 

Did you manage to make it through all 4 stages? If you failed, at what stage did it happen? Let’s discuss it in the comments section!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches.

In this video:

The history books (and Hollywood) often describe the famous lawman, Wyatt Earp, as many things: brave, courageous, moral, law-abiding, and honorable. In the story of the “Gunfight at the OK Corral,” Earp is often portrayed as the hero, the good guy we all should be rooting for. In truth, Wyatt Earp was a much more complicated individual who, among other things, was arrested several times in his life for various offenses, involved in a few major scandals (sometimes on the “bad guy” side), and otherwise seemed to be an individual who balanced precariously on that line between a life as a criminal and a life as a lawman.

""It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,"" his publicist Diana Baron said in a statement. ""He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.""

Bergling started out releasing music on Laidback Luke Forum in the late '00s, where DJs and producers would post music and seek feedback from budding peers. In 2011, he broke through to an international audience with the progressive house track ""Levels,"" which hit No. 1 in his native Sweden and on the U.S. Billboard Dance Club Songs chart -- and earned him a Grammy nod. His 2012 David Guetta collab ""Sunshine"" earned him a Grammy nomination as well, and that same year, he became the first electronic DJ/producer to headline New York City's storied Radio City Music Hall. 

In 2013, Avicii released his debut studio album, True, which featured the game-changing, massive international hit ""Wake Me Up!"" ft. Aloe Blacc. Combining EDM, folk and country music, the song became a No. 1 hit in many countries and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, Stories, dropped in 2015 and featured vocals from Chris Martin, Wyclef Jean, Robbie Williams, Matisyahu, Brandon Flowers, Gavin DeGraw and more. The EP Avīci (01) came out in Aug. 2017 and featured his Rita Ora collaboration ""Lonely Together.""

Avicii's health issues were known to the public for several years prior to his death. He suffered from acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. In 2014, he canceled numerous shows in order to recover after having his gallbladder and appendix removed. 

Eventually, he decided to retire from touring entirely in an emotional letter penned in March 2016.

“To me it was something I had to do for my health,” Bergling told The Hollywood Reporter in 2016. “The scene was not for me. It was not the shows and not the music. It was always the other stuff surrounding it that never came naturally to me. All the other parts of being an artist. I'm more of an introverted person in general. It was always very hard for me. I took on board too much negative energy, I think.”

We had the advice and assurance of several seasoned horse owners that this process could get a little stressful, but that all would be ok. Adding a new horse is something that seems so simple, but is it? There are horses kicking and horses biting in other videos. Will Tao and Maggie get along? I hope  you enjoy the journey!

I think this is a good time to re-state my position on ""education""! LOL I believe that the journey and the story are educational. We, as content creators, can't always have this perfect, white-washed, example of how to do something.

[Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, and the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on

[Verse 1: Sarah Aarons]
Don't have to hit below the belt
With those leather shoes you wear so well
No, you don't have to kiss and tell
'Cause you're only gonna hurt yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
The minute that I walk in, you're trying to hold me down
[?] your closet, 'til I'm face flat on the ground
Don't know what you've been drinking
Every time you come around
So let me down

[Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, take the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on

[Verse 2: Sarah Aarons]
I sent you running for the hills
I guess by now you know the drill
The type that only shoots to kill
And you only do it for the thrill

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
The minute that I walk in, you're trying to hold me down
[?] your closet, 'til I'm face flat on the ground
Don't know what you've been drinking
Every time you come around
So let me down

[Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, take the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on
Set this house on
Set this house on
Set this house on
Set this house on fire
Set this house on fire
Set this house on fire
Set this house on fire

[Outro: Sarah Aarons]
If that's the way it's gonna be
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep
And start burning up your ties
And take your coat, I guess, take the shirt right off my back
I don't mind, 'cause I'm gonna set this house on

I review it's cutscenes, story, and particularly gameplay to demonstrate how it fails to do what Half Life 2 did flawlessly, while also failing on it's own merits, it's rife with glitches, bad acting, and it's just shit.

It also has Keemstar playing the US president, while IHE and Pyrocynical play US marines, it's fucking wild.

I got to spend some time in Cupertino talking to Apple execs, seeing the sound lab, hearing the product vision, and living with HomePod both in the U.S. and at home for almost a week.

And here's my not-a-review — where HomePod fits into the Apple ecosystem and, just maybe, into your life.

Lyrics:

When the sky was gold
and I needed no protection
as the wind would blow
a 1000 miles in no direction
man it was a beautiful sight
days were soaked in sunlight
just so long ago
but lately I like to imagine

When I was young
whatever happened it would do me no wrong
as long as I could sing my favorite song
when I was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on
we were so high
let the freeway take us into the night
and in the dark you sang my favorite song
When I was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on and on and on and on
when I was young

Now the sky is grey
but honestly it doesn't hurt me
I learned to find my way
on the path of no returning
Everything I've left behind
I'm reminded every time I meet ur eyes
we were so bold and brave
baby can you imagine

When I was young
whatever happened it could do me no wrong
as long as I could sing my favorite song
when I was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on and on
we were so high
let the freeway take us into the night
and in the dark you sang my favorite song
When I was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on and on and on and on
When I was young

when I was young
we would play with fire
when I was young
and we would fuck the price
when I was young
It was do or die I would give my life just to feel like
When I was young

And the holidays went on and on and on and on and on
When I was young",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHhyuKvpKCM/sddefault.jpg,0.02870881528215913,0.0004162285313704872,68.97368421052633,0.0009912811076060288,0.02912504381352962,0.03011632492113565,2017-12-15,08:00:02,Friday,4,7,29,7,28,28,173,3,38,2,3,5,7,3,7,3.0,5.0,['vevo'],['vevo'],True,['vevo'],1,1,4,0,0,0,0,6.131336239548031,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

LYRICS:
with each breath, with each step
I fall a little further from the plans that I have laid
with each breath, with each step
I feel a little smaller in the bed that I have made

people will hate you shake you break you
standing firm will make you
unstoppable

when we stumble when we fall
when there's nothing left at all
we get up, we get up, we get up again
we get up, we get up, we get up again

with each breath, with each step
I fly a little closer to the ledge from where I fled
with each breath, with each step
I feel a little closure from the life that I have led

when the world is caving in
when your skin is wearing thin
we get up, we get up, we get up again
yeah we get up, we get up, we get up again

and now I know how much I can take
how my bones bend and crack before they break
how long the night lasts before the day
how far I need to walk around the world
before I start back again

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
and you won't fear death any longer",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHzinY2__hQ/sddefault.jpg,0.012921735069057574,0.0002991542529923028,43.19422150882825,0.00016822424820487443,0.013220889322049878,0.01338911357025475,2018-03-14,16:56:38,Wednesday,2,9,21,9,19,58,171,3,43,0,0,8,0,2,1,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.312091123097882,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

We road tested over 70 cars this year, but the Panamera came out on top.

We tested two versions: the Turbo and the 4S. The Turbo has a more powerful V8 engine. According to Porsche, the 4S can go from 0-60 mph in 4 seconds. Top speed: 179 mph. Its V6 engine has 440-horsepower. The Panamera starts at $85,000. It can be as much as $150,000 with added options.

There's an excellent infotainment system available with optional wireless data. Comfortably seats 4 passengers. Plenty of trunk space. An infrared ""Night View"" camera. Double panoramic sunroof. BOSE surround sound system. The body is back to the traditional Porsche design.

Congratulations, Porsche.

I will tell what, we all thought on the incident. At first we all thought it was crazy Khabib fans and then we all noticed Conor after him going crazy. I am sorry for Michael Chiesa for getting hurt and Ray Borg getting glass in his eye.

The only thing left after to this is to set is the biggest fight in UFC History.

Shoutout to UFC and Embedded for using a portion of my footage to give the fans a look inside the incident.

Apperances by Ray Borg, Michael Chiesa, Pat Berry, Anthony Pettis and more

YLQh8j-KomI,HwYMsqONPzE,Iran's Zarif says Israel's 'myth of invincibility' has crumbled (Munich Security Conference),ProductiehuisEU,25.0,2018-02-18 12:58:16+00:00,"['mohammad', 'javad', 'zarif', 'israel', 'iran', 'munich', 'security', 'conference']",211849.0,1884.0,410.0,448.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLQh8j-KomI/default.jpg,"01:40

Iran’s Foreign Minister said on Sunday the shooting down of an Israeli jet after it bombed an Iranian site in Syria had shattered Israel’s “so-called invincibility”, reacting to a critical speech delivered earlier by Israel’s premier Benjamin Netanyahu.

“Israel uses aggression as a policy against its neighbours,” Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Munich Security Conference, accusing Israel of “mass reprisals against its neighbours and daily incursions into Syria, Lebanon.”

“Once the Syrians have the guts to down one of its planes it’s as if a disaster has happened,” Zarif said.

He was responding to Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to the conference hours before, in which the Israeli prime minister, holding a piece of what he said was an Iranian drone, accused Iran of trying to impose an “empire” across the Middle East.

“What has happened in the past several days is the so-called invincibility (of Israel) has crumbled,” Zarif said of Netanyahu’s remarks, which followed the Feb. 10 downing of an Israeli F-16 jet.

David Ivry, a former Israeli Air Force chief, told Reuters earlier this month he believed it was the first time an Israeli F-16 was brought down since Israel began using the jets in the 1980s.

Anti-aircraft fire downed the jet as it was returning from a bombing raid on Iran-backed positions in Syria.

It was one of at least eight Israeli planes despatched in response to what Israel said was an Iranian drone’s incursion into its airspace earlier on that day.

The jet was hit by a Syrian anti-aircraft missile and crashed in northern Israel, according to an Israeli official.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLQh8j-KomI/sddefault.jpg,0.008893126708174218,0.0019353407379784661,4.595121951219512,0.002114713781986226,0.010828467446152684,0.012943181228138909,2018-02-18,12:58:16,Sunday,6,12,8,12,8,92,84,6,25,0,0,4,0,2,0,7.0,10.0,"['o', '', 'AOR', '', 'BAYERISCHER HOF', '', '4 Soricenee( NSC', '', 'Muinchner Sicherheitskonferenz', '', '   ', '   ', '     ', '', 'wo', 'Munich Security Conference MSC', 'BAYERISCHER HOF']","['o', 'AOR', 'BAYERISCHER', 'HOF', '4', 'Soricenee(', 'NSC', 'Muinchner', 'Sicherheitskonferenz', 'wo', 'Munich', 'Security', 'Conference', 'MSC', 'BAYERISCHER', 'HOF']",True,"['o', 'aor', 'bayerisch', 'hof', '4', 'soricene', '(', 'nsc', 'muinchner', 'sicherheitskonferenz', 'wo', 'munich', 'secur', 'confer', 'msc', 'bayerisch', 'hof']",17,15,92,1,0,0,1,6.339183698882924,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Verse 1]
How do I face this?
Everything's changin'
On a ""No talk"" basis
And I can't take no more
All of these spaces
Solely replacin'
All the things that made us
When you walked out that door

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like the quarter that you lost
In the space right between
The side door and the front seat of your car
So close but you're so far
So close but you're so far

[Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (aye)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost
Sleepin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Wakin' up on the couch
'Cause the bed doesn't feel right without you (yeah)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost
Sleepin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you



[Verse 2]
All of this silence
I'd rather be fightin'
At least I see your eyes when I push you too far
And now I'm realizin'
Everything I did
Used to be my right hand
But now you're way to far

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like the quarter that you lost
In the space right between
The side door and the front seat of your car
So close but you're so far
So close but you're so far

[Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (you)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost
Sleepin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Wakin' up on the couch
'Cause the bed doesn't feel right without you (yeah)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost
Sleepin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you


[Bridge]
I can't function, not for nothing
I wake up and I think 'bout you
Wish that I can switch the subject
Think of something else but you, oh
Wish I could cut you off but I'm too involved
These pictures on my phone feelin' like
You're so close but you're so far, yeah
So close but you're so far

[Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (yeah)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost
Sleepin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Wakin' up on the couch
'Cause the bed doesn't feel right without you (yeah)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost
Sleepin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (aye)
I've been up, I've been down, I've been lost

Snowboard is one of the six Olympic disciplines administered by FIS - The International Ski Federation. The discipline consists of five different events Big air, Halfpipe, Slopestyle, Snowboard cross, and parallel slalom. Snowboarding is a young snow sport which began in the 1960's. The 1960's were a time of evolution, as young people looked for different forms of expression in winter sports. Snowboarding began to be organized in that decade when the advancements in modern snowboard equipment and freedom of expression led to new and exciting snowboard techniques. Snowboarding's growing popularity is reflected in its recognition as an official sport: in 1985, with the first World Cup was held in Zürs, Austria.  In 1998 Snowboarding was added to the Olympic winter schedule.

Kim became the first North Korean leader to vist South Korea since the end of the war between the two countries in 1953. 

He was warmly welcomed and embraced by South Korea's President Moon Jae-In. 

Both leaders were relaxed and smiling during small talk.

It's time to answer the question! Which of Captain America's shields is better!? His original star-spangled shield, or his new Wakandan shield? New vs Old! Find out in this video!

Which one is more Destructive. Which one is more Defensive?

Fun facts: While his original shield is bigger (2600cm squared), the Wakandan shield is only 1600cm squared. But since there are two, they actually offer more cover together, than the original shield by itself!

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Ali Hussein - Hey John love your show. Netflix just greenlight bright sequel and will smith is returning. I checked the reviews is not good. Why does Netflix rush with the sequel. The movie came out today i don't understand that. Love do hear your thoughts.

Linus Knight - it looks like we are not getting Nova OR Adam Warlock i’m Vol. 3 “Officially” - James Gunn replied to a fans ig post (mine) when asked if they would be in it to avoid fan disappointment. Q: Since James Gunn officially stayed we won’t get Warlock/Nova in 3, is this a terrible idea by Gunn?

Jack - Hey John big fan. My question is if Avengers infinity war is a huge success is there anyway the oscars can not award it something? It’s gonna be revolutionary movie.

Came The Dawn - Can you please comment on the backlash against Last Jedi being exposed as a fake: 1. Indie Wire reported Alt-right claimed credit for the backlash against Last Jedi. 2. Fans polled on alternative site rated Last Jedi at 89% & 3. the bots accidentally attacked the wrong page (Shape Of Water instead of Last Jedi).

Andrew Costello - Huge fan.  After waiting so long to watch the Darkest Hour, I was disappointed to find that there is nowhere in my state playing it, and I cannot find it on any streaming service.   Yet, it seems that the few places in America playing it had sold out theaters and had to put on extra shows.

Lyrics:

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus Freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Erik Voss analyzes this trailer shot for shot for missable clues about Infinity War's plot. How is Cap strong enough to hold off Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet? What is Gamora's backstory with Thanos? Will Thor get a new hammer? What is happening to Doctor Strange with the crystals in his face? Which character's death is hinted at in this trailer? What details in this trailer point to the SOUL STONE?

Micah decided to wield its power to train the cats to give a high five and jump into his arms. Is operational conditioning strong enough for both tricks to succeed? B.F. Skinner, who is best known for his work on operational conditioning, believed that practically all behavior could be boiled down to a response based on past experiences and their consequences. Once you finish watching this video, you be the judge.

In this video, Micah defines and explains operant conditioning and how positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment can all be used to influence behavior. Of course, in this experiment, only positive reinforcement was used. Leave a comment below with your thoughts and feedback!

Erik Killmonger appears in Black Panther, portrayed by Michael B. Jordan.[5][6] This version is an American black-ops soldier named Erik Stevens who earned the nickname ""Killmonger"".[7] Born N'Jadaka, he is the son of N'Jobu, brother of Wakandan ruler T'Chaka. He lived with his father in Oakland, California in the United States until finding his father dead from a confrontation with T'Chaka and Zuri about stolen vibranium. He is left in Oakland to keep N'Jobu's death a secret. In the present, he works as a black-ops soldier where he has scarifications on his body for every kill he has made. He plots to take the throne from T'Challa and continue his father's plan of providing people of African descent worldwide with Wakandan weaponry, so they may fight back their oppressors. Killmonger kills Ulysses Klaue to gain support of the Border Tribe and challenge King T'Challa to personal combat for the throne. After killing Zuri, Killmonger appears to kill to T'Challa in that duel and becomes King. After ingesting a heart-shaped herb (being T'Challa's cousin, he does not die from the herb as in the comics), he orders the rest incinerated (though Nakia takes one to heal T'Challa) and dons his own black panther suit (It is brown with gold highlights as opposed to black with purple highlights and silver lining, and has been dubbed by the internet as the ""Golden Jaguar"". Like T'Challa's suit in the film, it can absorb kinetic energy-represented in the gold highlights-and release it in a gold shockwave-as opposed to purple-after enough has been amassed. It can also fold into a gold necklace.). However, T'Challa survives and continues the challenge, which officially never concluded. When Killmonger refuses to cooperate, he thus immediately invalidates his claim to the throne and the Royal bodyguard turns against him. In the resulting insurrection, Killmonger's allied Border tribe is defeated and Killmonger himself continues his challenge with T'Challa, taking them into the vibranium mines. At T'Challa's command, Shuri activates the vibranium transport train on the bottom track, the stabilizers disrupting both suits. Killmonger is mortally wounded by T'Challa, and requests to see the sunset over Wakanda that his father told him was more beautiful than anywhere else in the world. T'Challa grants him this request, and offers medical aid. Killmonger declines, knowing that he will",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YSS3rfPf5kc/sddefault.jpg,0.012749788752581651,0.0003441162675813123,37.0508166969147,0.0007769158563904764,0.013093905020162964,0.013870820876553442,2018-03-06,17:01:51,Tuesday,1,11,50,11,41,92,452,7,90,0,0,10,0,1,0,7.0,8.0,['I sis ea'],"['I', 'sis', 'ea']",True,"['I', 'si', 'ea']",3,3,5,0,1,1,1,3.0859133473651745,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Casspi takes a huge amount of his shots around the rim. Steve Kerr and Klay Thompson were both asked Wednesday to explain why Omri is so effective at getting to the rim, and both had the same answer.
""He'll maybe dance behind his guy, his guy will look at him, and as soon as the guy turns his head back...Omri's gone,"" Kerr said pregame.

""He just has a knack for knowing when his defender isn't looking,"" Thompson said.

A reporter then told Casspi what Thompson said about his cutting, and Omri wasn't necessarily happy about it.
""I can't tell you guys all my secretes,"" Casspi said playfully. ""Next game I'm going to have my man looking at me the whole time. Just play hard man, it is what it is.""

Casspi had an efficient game in the Warriors 97-84 win over Memphis. The small forward had eight points on only five shots, and added two rebounds and an assist in 13 minutes of action. He also had a team-high plus-14 in the +/- column.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YSTl01XENUo/sddefault.jpg,0.0047560854774251074,0.00013211348548403077,36.0,0.00033028371371007683,0.0048881989629091386,0.0052184826766192155,2017-12-21,08:25:51,Thursday,3,13,5,13,5,80,41,2,11,0,1,1,0,5,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.498704118677996,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'bottle': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Watch/listen: http://jlptalk.com Jesse shows you examples of pure evil at the Women's March 2018. He doubts that any man would have the nerve or want to do a so-called #MeToo to these women. There was a pro-life March for Life protesting abortion, and it was a difference between night and day. The pro-Planned Parenthood march was in favor of everything wrong, transgender stuff, amnesty for illegal aliens, homosexuality. President Trump tweeted that it was great weather to celebrate the advances they've enjoyed under him, including the lowest female unemployment in 18 years. Jesse plays CNN clips. He used to work with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards as a union organizer. (Ann Richards, her mother, was a radical Democrat governor of Texas.) She strokes black women who voted 98% for Democrat Doug Jones, while 68% of white women voted for Roy Moore in Alabama, and the majority nationwide voted for Donald Trump. Some woman Viola Davis (an actress, apparently) shouted, growled, and preached like she was trying to outdo Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globes saying ""Time's Up,"" or ""You told Harpo to beat me!"" (credit: The Color Purple). More women (and a girly male) spoke including Natalie Portman, Whoopi Goldberg, and Larry Wilmore. BTW: Viola Davis with her big afro looks like Angela Davis, a hard black power-type woman.

New Line Cinema’s comedy “Life of the Party” stars Melissa McCarthy under the direction of Ben Falcone. When her husband suddenly dumps her, longtime dedicated housewife Deanna (McCarthy) turns regret into re-set by going back to college…landing in the same class and school as her daughter, who’s not entirely sold on the idea. Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected. The film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”). McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers. Falcone’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (“The Boss,” “Horrible Bosses 2,” “Daddy’s Home”); production designer Rusty Smith (“The Boss”); editor Brian Olds (“Central Intelligence”); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the “The Hangover” films). The music is by Fil Eisler (“How to Be Single,” “Empire”). New Line Cinema Presents, an On the Day Production, “Life of the Party.” Slated for release on May 11, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company. It has been rated PG-13.

They feel more solid than the S8 and S8 Plus for some reason, the low-light camera is insane, and that screen? Drool.

But what if you love the hardware but aren't the biggest fan of the software or Samsung's Experience UI (formerly TouchWiz UI). Now, I admit Samsung's UI is way better than it used to be, but some people out there might want to use stock Android instead--no judgement, I get it. So in this tip and trick Tuesday, here's how to make the Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus look like stock Android.

My name is Lucy, I'm a 24-year-old girl from the Netherlands, and I'm here to offer an alternative approach to beauty.

On this channel I do mostly hair tutorials where I show you how to braid, pin and style your own hair. I recreate hairstyles from movies & tv shows and I regularly come up with my own, which I love to share with you!

I  do lifestyle and beauty videos as well, ranging from wearable everyday looks, makeup tips and DIY natural beauty treatments, to fashion lookbooks, vegetarian recipes and more extreme Halloween tutorials. 

If you enjoy history, you've come to the right place as well. I have a few series based on historical makeup and hairstyling that are my little passion projects. 

Enjoy browsing!

Love,
Lucy

One of our biggest complaints with smartphones in 2017 is that they've become just too expensive. Like seriously, devices like the iPhone X are almost as expensive as a full blown MacBook. I don't really think you're getting $1000 worth of phon and the arrival of the OnePlus 5T allows me to have a device that can prove why.

Let me put this to you in perspective: If you damage an iPhone X in any way that pushes the repairs out of warranty, guess how much money you'll have to pay to replace it? No, you're not seeing photoshop work.. You're gonna have to cough an insane five and a half Benjamin's to get it fixed. So if I told you that you can buy one of the best Android phones of 2017 for that same price, what would you say?

the hilarious, sassy and inspiring Olympian we’ve all come to know and love – to comment on Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir’s figure skating performance and it was incredible to say the least. 
But we weren’t the only ones who thought Leslie and Adam were the perfect pair. 
One Twitter user wrote QUOTE, “Now that’s how you do sports commentary. Make it exciting, make it fun, make it relatable. I love me some @Lesdoggg. You the best.” While another wrote, “We SOOOO need Leslie to be a SPORTS COMMENTATOR! You slay all day, Leslie!”
Even though this is the first time Leslie and Adam joined forces for any type of commentary, I think we can all agree that they are the ULTIMATE commentary team. 
While we’re all fawning over this amazing pairing, somewhere in the world, Kirstie Alley is licking her wounds because she got burned pretty bad by the USA Curling Team. It all started when the actress tweeted QUOTE, “I’m not trying to be mean but… curling is boring.” Well, opinions are opinions – no matter how wrong they are according to Winter Olympian and member of the 2018 Men’s Olympic Curling Team Matt Hamilton. 
However, the curling team as a whole couldn’t resist clapping back with a response hot enough to melt all the ice in South Korea. The team’s Twitter account responded to Kirstie’s comment with QUOTE, “We’re not trying to be mean either, but your movies weren’t exactly riveting theater, Kirstie.” Ouch. 
She ended up deleting her original tweet, but don’t worry, the feud between Kirstie and the curling team eventually died down when Kirstie publicly decided to give curling another chance since her son is a huge fan. 
The curling team eventually tweeted, “Aww, Kirstie Alley, we knew you’d come around! Allow us or our good friends at Hollywood Curl to show you and your son the ropes sometime.” Are they giving out gold medals for how quickly people end feuds and forgive others because I think everyone in this situation deserves one. 
What did you guys think of all of this? Do you think Leslie has a future in sports commentary? And are you surprised by how quickly Kirstie and the Men’s Olympic Curling Team settled their differences? Let me know all your thoughts on this in the comment section below. When you’re done with that, click right over here to get all the details on how one woman managed to scam her way into the 2018 Winter Olympics by doing the bare minimum.

About SXSW:
Started in 1987, South by Southwest (SXSW) is a set of film, interactive, and music festivals and conferences that take place early each year in mid-March in Austin, Texas. SXSW’s original goal was to create an event that would act as a tool for creative people and the companies they work with to develop their careers, to bring together people from a wide area to meet and share ideas. That continues to be the goal today whether it is music, film or interactive technologies.

VIEWER EMAILS
PATREON SUPPORTER Jeff Bingham - I kind of get the sense Solo is getting drowned out by Infinity War and Deadpool 2 at the moment. Between Infinity War promoting an extinction level movie event (hence the opening) and Deadpool 2 ramping up the irreverence (Peter has his own Twitter account), promotion for Solo honestly looks a little too ordinary now, despite the Star Wars name and regardless of final quality.

Andrew - Fan from the UK, here. WB have shown themselves to be reactionary, to their own movies and others (i.e. the MCU). My question is, do you think seeing the execution of Infinity War, and its success, will lead WB to make more changes, or will they stick their current course? My view is, their current slate may do well, but will never be an event like Justice League was supposed to be.

Martin Jeffries - Infinity War faces it’s first real box office challenge on May 18th when Deadpool 2 opens. Between now and then we have Bad Samaritans, Tully, Overboard, Life Of The Party and Breaking In. Are these films just being thrown in Infinity War’s path to die? Which of these films do you think will perform the best? Thanks, and bring on the filthy!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYeceZaTHIM/hqdefault.jpg,0.029597383932848723,0.002666055695569765,11.1015625,0.008914623732061403,0.03226343962841849,0.04117806336047989,2018-04-30,21:54:19,Monday,0,14,57,14,51,78,469,1,92,0,2,13,23,2,1,5.0,7.0,"['MOHS Wd NW NHOf3HL', 'aie ud', '', 'es']","['MOHS', 'Wd', 'NW', 'NHOf3HL', 'aie', 'ud', 'es']",True,"['moh', 'Wd', 'NW', 'nhof3hl', 'aie', 'ud', 'es']",7,7,21,0,1,1,0,6.436782271019667,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.

Lyrics :

Standing in the heavy rain
I was someone.. I was not

Freezing cold I follow
The wind like an arrow
It will lead me to you

I’m lost in Istanbul
Uh nananana, Uh nananana
Uh nana, Uh nana
I’m lost in Istanbul
Uh nananana, Uh nananana
Uh nana, Uh nana
I’m lost in Istanbul

Walking down the crowded streets
I’m about to lose my mind
City lights are drowned in darkness
Your love is all I want

Freezing cold I follow
The wind like an arrow
It will lead me to you
Freezing cold I follow
The wind like an arrow
It will lead me to you

I’m lost in Istanbul
Uh nananana, Uh nananana
Uh nana, Uh nana
I’m lost in Istanbul
Uh nananana, Uh nananana
Uh nana, Uh nana
I’m lost in Istanbul

Tryna find you now
Lost in Istanbul
I’m here for you
I’m down
Can you heal my wounds?
Lost in Istanbul
I just cannot be found

I’m lost in Istanbul
Uh nananana, Uh nananana
Uh nana, Uh nana
I’m lost in Istanbul
Uh nananana, Uh nananana
Uh nana, Uh nana
I’m lost in Istanbul

I’m lost in Istanbul
