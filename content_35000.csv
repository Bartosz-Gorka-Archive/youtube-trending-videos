-'화유기' OST Part 2 'When I Saw You' 공개


'When I Saw you'는 극중 손오공(이승기 분)과 진선미(오연서 분)의 운명적인 첫 만남과 가슴 아픈 이별 사이의 감정을 몽환적으로 표현한 곡으로, 

시청자뿐만 아니라 청자들의 감성까지 자극하는 노래를 완성했다.


특히, 히트곡 '미친 연애', '갖고 놀래' 등 R&B 힙합 장르를 기반으로 한 음악들로 국내 음원차트를 석권한 가수 범키가 그룹 뉴이스트 W에 이어 '화유기'의 두 번째 가창자로 참여해 

그만의 독보적인 음색과 소울풀한 감성으로 드라마 스토리에 힘을 실을 예정이라 많은 기대가 모아지고 있다.


tvN '화유기'는 고대소설 서유기를 모티브로 퇴폐적 악동요괴 손오공과 고상한 젠틀 요괴 우마왕이 어두운 세상에서 빛을 찾아가는 여정을 그린 '절대낭만 퇴마극'이다.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Taking the Chao Phraya Express Boat is an easy way to visit both Wat Arun and Wat Pho which are two of the most beautiful Thailand Temples in the entire country!

One of the most popular Bangkok tourist places, the Grand Palace was a little more difficult to find. We didn’t end up making it in time to enter. We decided to come back the next day and we were finally able to explore the Grand Palace Thailand. We were shocked at how many other people were exploring it too! The Grand Palace was filled with the most tourists we have ever seen.

Our favorite Bangkok Temple was hands down Wat Arun Temple, otherwise known as the Temple of the Dawn. It is one of the only temples in Bangkok left that you can climb on. We got lucky while visiting Wat Arun because there weren’t that many tourists there.

A quick boat ride across the Chao Phraya River led us to another Buddhist Temple, Wat Pho or Temple of the Reclining Buddha. The Reclining Buddha is one of the most iconic figures in all of Bangkok Thailand and we were happy to see it. Wat Pho was pretty busy with tourists, but it was an incredible experience to finally see the Reclining Buddha.

In our opinion, the 3 Best Temples in Bangkok Thailand are:
1. Wat Arun - Temple of the Dawn (100 Baht entrance fee)
2. Grand Palace - (500 Baht entrance fee) Incredibly impressive, although expensive and too many tourists
3. Wat Pho - Temple of the Reclining Buddha (100 Baht entrance fee)

* Unlike other travel vloggers, we live and work in a different country each month. Our channel will show you what it’s like to live abroad while exploring top tourist destinations and hidden gems. We will eat local cuisine but still find the best spots to have American food while overseas. Each month we rent an apartment or airbnb in a different city or country, so follow along on this journey and learn about countries around the world. We hope you enjoy our travel vlog, don’t forget to subscribe!

Once the referee brought the Clásico to an end at Camp Nou on Sunday evening, the players made their way to the centre circle, just as they did in the Wanda Metropolitano after the Copa del Rey final and in Riazor after winning the league, to celebrate the 2017/18 double.

Once together in the centre of the pitch at Camp Nou, the players formed the now familiar circle to display just how much their success this season means to them. Andrés Iniesta, having been substituted in the second half of his final Clásico came off the bench barefoot to join in the celebrations.

With the Barça anthem sounding out, confetti falling, the player began their lap of honour after which Gerard Piqué commandeered a microphone to announce, “As we’re league champions and nobody has given us a guard of honour today, we have asked the coaching staff to do it as we leave the field.” That is how the celebrations concluded with the honour of the unbeaten still intact.

Darkseid versus Thanos.  The Lord of Apokolips versus The Mad Titan. The God of Evil versus an Eternal initially named Dione. Yes, that’s Thanos’ real name. Wonder why he ditched it.

Given the gargantuan cost of bringing Justice League to the screen, and the impact this kind of opening will have on the value and the future of the entire DC brand on film, this is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster.

In this editorial, @AndreEinherjar will first provide a brief recap of the troubled history of Justice League, and how important the movie is for the future of DC on film, including the Batman solo movies. Then the controversies surrounding the movies release will be covered, the boxoffice numbers put into context, and finally, how this could have happened explained, and where DC might go from here discussed.

SO todays was footage was about my venture into town for an audition.

I feel like I'm posting a lot about auditions, but I think its a good thing. Actors go through countless auditions before they might get something, its not all just success and job offers. SO I feel responsible to give a true representation of an actors life!

This video is shorter than my previous videos, but I'm trying to keep the content entertaining, rather than long.

It was a glorious day in LONDON, thank you Carrie for having a lovely lunch with me.

YAY I got a recall. There will be a follow up video.

IN A small pool of water in an Indonesian back yard, lives Kojek the crocodile. Kojek spends his days in a small channel of water at the back of Irwan’s garden. The family's washing hangs right next to it and Irwan’s three children are free to play ballgames on the turquoise-green ceramic tiles parallel to the croc. Because he’s been with the same family for 20 years, Kojek, according to Irwan, poses no threat to humans. In the whole time he’s lived with Irwan, there have been no accidents or injuries – to humans at least.

[Intro: Pressa]
Uh, uh, na-na-naa
Uh, uh, na-na-naaaa

[Chorus: Pressa]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done fucked up and got me in a cruiser (Wo, Wo, Wo)

[Verse 1: Pressa]
I talk a lot of shit 'cause I could back it (up)
Got my dick in her throat watch her back it (suck)
I'm all about my bread like a fat kid
I'm all about my swag like its fashion
And I'm super savage, grew up as the bad kid (bad kid)
My niggas on your block, call it camping (camping)
They don't want no static (Lah, nLah, Lah, Lah)
Pull up let em have it (bow, bow, bow, bow)

[Chorus: Pressa]

From the dot where we known to let it go (go)
My niggas they gon' make a hole up at the door (ayy)
Her mama trip I fucked her in the Bando

Yeah that's my plan, this rappin' shit won't fuck my plans up (woo)
No, uh-uh, in the goose fur, with the shooters

So many niggas wanna see me out and fly me
I tell 'em, ""run up pussy, try me"" (try me, pussy)
Tell 'em, ""run up pussy, find me"" (find me)
I been in the Dodge with some killers right behind me
I remember days when them bitches weren't beside me
I remember in the corner cooking up the 9-piece

[Verse 3: Pressa]
I give it all up, to see my man back
I brought a mop instead, to see my opps dead
I see the same fed, I knew I clocked it
Studio trappin', just for content
'Cause I don't know what they have at the border (border)
All this good mixin' bad, feeling bipolar (bipolar)
If the feds on my tail, I start to floor her (zoom)
Big chain on my belly, fuck a chocker (fuck a chocker)
Came up off of homers , junkys sleeping over

Trappin' was a hobby, Honda was the car key (trap)

[Chorus: Pressa]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)

With stellar performances, epic roasts, and shocking wins, it’s safe to say that the 2018 Oscars were nothing short of spectacular.

The Oscars have come and gone, and aside from the most prestigious actors and directors in the game being recognized for their performances, let’s be real – what REALLY sets the tone for the evening is the performance of the host. The bar was set real high this year as Jimmy Kimmel had some big shoes to fill… his own shoes, to be exact. So you know it’s gonna be a good year when he reclaims his hosting fame.

Kimmel covered a number of topics in his opening monologue, including sexual harassment in the industry, the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, and that whole ‘best picture’ flub from last year, specifically roasting Emma Stone and the cast of La La Land, so naturally her bestie Jennifer Lawrence had to get in on the action…

And not only did Jimmy serve the shade tonight, but he also served an epic bribe for whoever could deliver the shortest acceptance speech. With the help of Helen Mirren, one lucky actor would be driving away in a brand new jet ski, which is probably nothing compared to the Oscar nominee goody bags filled with like, vacations and private islands and whatever else.

Jimmy then decided to take a little break from the Oscar ambiance and stroll on over to a local movie theater with a few of his famous friends including Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie, Mark Hammill, and Lupita Nyongo to name a few, who surprised an entire audience of moviegoers watching A Wrinkle in Time. Although Jimmy pointed out that the theater reeked of marijuana, this clearly could not have been a more perfect time to also hand out some good ol’ fashioned munchies…

Moving on to some of tonight’s most talked-about presenters and two ladies who may have just booted Jimmy out of his hosting throne, were Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph, who literally stole the show, Ugg slippers and all…

I think I speak for the actual world when I beg of the award show gods – Tiffany and Maya, PLEASE CO-HOST SOMETHING TOGETHER SOON… literally anything. But as we all know, it wouldn’t be a true award show season without J-Law being… J-Law. She once again proved she’s a woman of many talents when she was caught juggling a glass of wine while hobbling over a row of chairs, and might I add, she did all of this without spilling a drop. This move in and of itself literally deserves it’s own Oscar.

While Joseph Stalin’s cult of personality, subsequent statues, and certain photos and paintings may have you thinking he was a giant of a man, in truth the former Soviet leader and glorious moustache owner was only around 5 feet 5 inches tall (165 cm), give or take an inch.

ABOUT THE GAME

Shadow of the Colossus, released in Japan as Wander and the Colossus (Japanese: ワンダと巨像 Hepburn: Wanda to Kyozō), is an action-adventure video game developed by SIE Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEI) for the PlayStation 2. The game was released in North America and Japan in October 2005 and PAL territories in February 2006. It was directed by Fumito Ueda and developed at SCEI's International Production Studio 1, also known as Team Ico; the same development team responsible for the cult hit Ico, to which the game is considered a spiritual successor.

The game's storyline focuses on a young man named Wander who enters a forbidden land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus has been described as a puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.

Cited as an influential title in the video game industry and one of the greatest games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games.

A HD remastered version developed by Bluepoint Games, that collects both games was released as The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection (ICO & Shadow of the Colossus Classics HD in the PAL region) for the PlayStation 3 in September 2011; it features high-definition (HD) graphics, content previously missing from the North American version, PlayStation Network Trophies, and 3D support. The HD version was released separately in Japan. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in February 2018.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iAK3T3Nw-pk/sddefault.jpg,0.020185902588982386,0.0010300990914929972,19.59607843137255,0.004366812227074236,0.021216001680475386,0.025582813907549608,2018-02-03,12:45:07,Saturday,5,11,75,11,36,62,522,1,61,0,0,7,0,4,21,5.0,6.0,['> Pa ='],"['>', 'Pa', '=']",True,"['>', 'Pa', '=']",3,3,4,2,0,1,0,6.718017718887893,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

At the outset I wasn't over confident but felt it was possible, good quality plywood is strong. It's worked out well but without testing it over time I couldn't be super confident it will hold up indefinitely. There really is a lot of stress, especially on the top hinge. Also I'm comparing it to the steel seat I built a couple of weeks ago and that thing is rock solid.

I really liked how the frame came out but I struggled to find a seat design I liked that complimented it. I played around with a few ideas before settling on the same style seat as my other swing out seat. I reckon it looks fine but not sure that I nailed it.

As always I'm happy to answer any questions.

First time director Ari Aster's instant horror classic has been terrifying audiences with its haunting score, creepy performances and countless twists and turns, but is it the scariest movie of all time? While critics have been comparing it to The Exorcist and audiences have been divided as to what it all means, we just can't wait to watch it again!

It’s the first confirmed object from another star observed in our solar system, and was discovered Oct. 19 by the University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope team, funded by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations Program. The telescope team named it ‘Oumuamua (oh MOO-uh MOO-uh) – Hawaiian for “a messenger from afar arriving first.” The unusually-shaped asteroid, which is up to a quarter mile long and perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide, may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

I loved the sound of when you 
came home, 

Oh I I was always on your side,

When you run me down and you run my mind
Why you treat me like that
When you talk to me it’s always your time 
And I don’t really need that

I thought that you were family
You’re not speaking to me 
I put it on the line for you

Made something out of nothing
everyone above me 
I put it on the line for you

I use to feel the embers burning 
Now I’m the queen of apathy 

Tell if I’m running away 
Tell me if my secrets are safe 
Tell me if you want me to stay",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iBA9LXKrLPw/sddefault.jpg,0.012602888413181777,0.00012060180299695481,104.5,0.0003618054089908644,0.012723490216178732,0.013085295625169595,2018-04-12,17:23:55,Thursday,3,9,11,8,11,37,94,3,19,0,0,8,3,4,0,3.0,8.0,"['A song by The Aces', 'PUT IT ON THE LINE', '', '2018 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED', '', 'HU']","['A', 'song', 'by', 'The', 'Aces', 'PUT', 'IT', 'ON', 'THE', 'LINE', '2018', 'ALL', 'RIGHTS', 'RESERVED', 'HU']",True,"['A', 'song', 'by', 'the', 'ace', 'put', 'IT', 'ON', 'the', 'line', '2018', 'all', 'right', 'reserv', 'HU']",15,14,47,0,4,1,7,3.6356776366658776,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Description:

Because YouTubers live most of their lives in front of a camera, you may think you know everything about them. But everyone has their secrets. Even your favorite YouTubers. Here are 10 Things That Logan Paul Doesn’t Want You To Know.

Remember when Logan and Jake started telling everyone that they had a little brother named Roman? Well, that was completely fake. Roman Paul is just a stage name. The little boy’s name is Roman Serfaty and he is the son of one of Logan’s ex-girlfriends. He is in no way related to the famous YouTuber.

Did you know that Logan was once arrested? If you didn’t, you aren’t the only one. Logan likes to keep that a secret. It all happened when he was vacationing in Italy and was flying a drone over the Coliseum in Rome. The drone landed near the historical landmark which is apparently a big no, no. The police then came to reprimand him and his brother.

Logan was also evicted from an apartment complex. People usually think of Jake Paul when it comes to getting kicked out of places, but it’s happened to Logan as well. The apartment manager of the complex made Logan leave because the other residents were complaining about the noise that Logan’s fans were causing. Logan doesn’t really tell that story very often.

Whether it’s stories about his ex-girlfriends or secret YouTube channels, there are a lot of things that Logan Paul doesn’t want to be out in the open. Stay tuned to 10 Things Logan Paul Doesn’t Want You To Know to find out why the star is so secretive about his relationship with Jessica Serfaty.

Love is Madness
Thirty Seconds To Mars

You are insane
My desire
A violent daydream

Love, Love

You are crazy
A perfect liar
Said you’d save me

Love, Love

I knew the moment
I looked into your eyes
I’d have to swallow all your lies
   
I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other
Be your lover
Live in Sin

You are insane
My desire
A dangerous game

Love, Love

You are crazy
A perfect liar
Said please save me

Love, Love

I knew the moment
I looked into your eyes
I’d have to swallow all your lies

I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other
Be your lover
Live in Sin

Lord
Lord
Lord

Love is madness

I knew the moment
I knew the moment
I knew the moment
Love is madness

I knew the moment
I looked into your eyes
I knew the moment
I looked into your eyes

Love is madness

I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other
Be your lover
Live in sin

Lord

Love is madness

Is Justice League better than critics are making it out to be? How do Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman match up against the superheroes of the MCU? Did Steppenwolf work as the villain in the Justice League movie?

THE NEED TO KNOW is a panel discussion show that catches you up on everything you need to know from this week in nerdy news, and once you're caught up, we'll even tell you a little more that most people don't know.

Watch as Erik Voss, Tommy Bechtold, Sam Bashor, and Maude Garrett all dive in!

Washington is still in bandages, but as you can see, he is up and running (and jumping, and kissing, and hugging).

fromis_9! 첫 번째 미니앨범 ‘To. Heart’로 떨리는 데뷔!
프로미스나인 데뷔 앨범 ‘To. Heart’ 발매! 실력+외모+퍼포먼스 겸비한 ‘2018 기대주’
fromis_9 데뷔 앨범 ‘To. Heart’! 설레는 마음 담아 풋풋하고 사랑스러운 매력 발산!
프로미스나인, 중독성 강한 타이틀곡부터 멤버 전원 작사 참여한 수록곡까지! 
꽉 채운 첫 번째 “선물 상자”를 전하다.


프로미스나인(fromis_9)이 데뷔 앨범 [To. Heart]를 발매하며 2018년 가요계에 전격 출사표를 던졌다. 프로미스나인은 Mnet ‘아이돌학교’에서 대중의 투표를 통해 선발된 9명의 멤버 노지선, 송하영, 이새롬, 이채영, 이나경, 박지원, 이서연, 백지헌, 장규리로 구성되어 있으며 2018년 차세대 K팝 기대주로 떠오르고 있다.

프로미스나인은 지난해 11월 프리 데뷔곡 ‘유리구두’를 통해 프로미스나인만의 통통 튀는 매력을 맘껏 뿜어냈으며, 정식 데뷔에 앞서 가요계의 이목을 집중시킨 바 있다. 특히 ‘2017 MAMA(Mnet Asian Music Awards, 엠넷 아시안 뮤직 어워즈)’를 통해 정식 데뷔 전 실력, 외모, 퍼포먼스까지  겸비한 완전체 무대를 첫 선보이며 가요계 관계자들에게 올 상반기 최고 기대주로 주목을 받으며 데뷔에 대한 기대감을 고조시켰다. 

정식 데뷔 앨범 [To. Heart]는 총 6곡이 수록되어 있는 미니 앨범으로 프리 데뷔곡 ‘유리구두’의 연장선상에 놓여있으며, 소중한 마음을 남기고 나를 찾아달라며 떠난 프로미스나인이 나를 찾아와줄 누군가를 위해 나도 한 발짝 먼저 다가가겠다는 설레는 마음을 담아냈다.

타이틀곡 ‘To Heart’는 프로미스나인만의 발랄한 매력을 한껏 발산하며 중독성 강한 멜로디에 락킹한 기타리프와 댄서블하면서도 통통 튀는 드럼 사운드가 어우러진 팝 댄스 곡으로, 표현이 서툴고 사랑을 시작하고 싶은 소녀의 마음을 수줍게 써 내려간 러브레터에 가득 담아 진심을 표현한 노래로 고백송을 넘어 스테디셀러의 탄생을 예감케 한다.

또한 데뷔 앨범 [To. Heart]에는 Mnet '아이돌학교' 파이널 미션곡 '환상속의 그대’, '피노키오', 아홉 소녀의 꿈을 노래한 'Be With You', 프리 데뷔곡 '유리구두(MAMA ver.)'까지 다채로운 음악으로 음악팬들의 귀를 즐겁게 할 것이다. 특히 앨범의 시작을 알리는 인트로 ‘나에게로 오는 길’은 프로미스나인 멤버 전원이 작사에 참여했으며 직접 내레이션을 하는 등 프로미스나인의 진솔한 마음을 담아 완성했다.

데뷔 전부터 남다른 행보를 걸으며 국내외 팬들의 마음을 사로잡은 프로미스나인(fromis_9)은
첫 번째 미니앨범[To. Heart]를 통해 9인 9색 프로미스나인(fromis_9) 만의 매력과 음악적 역량을 과시하며 다채롭게 준비한 앨범이란 점에서 팀명처럼 최고의 걸그룹이 되겠다는 팬들과의 약속(promise)을 지키는 앨범이 될 것이다. '2018 글로벌 루키’가 될 프로미스나인의 데뷔에 주목해 보자. 

[Track review]

2. To Heart *TITLE
Lyrics by 이기, 용배 Composed by 이기, 용배 Arranged by 이기, 용배

데뷔 앨범의 타이틀곡 ‘To Heart’는 표현이 서툴고 사랑을 시작하고 싶은 소녀의 마음을 수줍게 써 내려간, 미리 쓴 러브레터라는 독특한 콘셉트에 담았다. 락킹한 기타리프와 현악기의 독특한 조화, 댄서블하면서도 통통 튀는 드럼 사운드가 어우러진 팝 댄스 곡이다.. 또한 힘차며 중독성 강한 후렴구는 프로미스나인만의 밝은 에너지가 가득 담겨 있어 그들의 색을 온전히 느낄 수 있다.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFcQPZwsxwU/sddefault.jpg,0.011375484152879051,0.000197597027369598,57.56910569105691,0.0005494161248813213,0.011573081180248652,0.012122497305129971,2018-05-08,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,8,38,8,33,45,335,0,76,0,1,8,17,2,0,5.0,8.0,['Las'],['Las'],True,['la'],1,1,2,0,0,0,0,6.290705975195725,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

It feels like we’ve had a new award show to watch every week, and we just found out who got nominated for the most coveted prize – an Oscar. The Oscars are the most prestigious of all award shows and you know you’ve made it when you get honored by the academy with a nomination, or even better; a win.
There has been a ton of conversation about two movies in particular, Get Out and Call Me By Your Name. At the Golden Globes, Get Out was nominated for Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy which made people quite angry because if you’ve seen it you KNOW it’s not a comedy. And Call Me By Your Name has yet to take home a win. Fans have been nervous that these two dramas wouldn’t be considered for Best Picture by the Academy and thankfully they were wrong!
Get Out and Call Me By Your Name have both been nominated for Best Picture along with “Darkest Hour”, “Dunkirk”, “Lady Bird”, “Phantom Thread”, “The Post”, “The Shape of Water” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”. Every single one of these movies is a masterpiece and we’re glad that we’re not the ones who have to choose which one should be recognized as the best.
Almost every Best Picture nominee also has someone up for Best Lead Actor/Actress. Timothée Chalamet is up for an Oscar for “Call Me by Your Name” along with Daniel Day-Lewis, for “Phantom Thread”, Gary Oldman for “Darkest Hour”, Denzel Washington for“ Roman J. Israel, Esq.” and Daniel for “Get Out”! 
For the ladies we have Saoirse Ronan for “Ladybird”, Margot Robbie for “I, Tonya” Frances McDormand for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”, Sally Hawkins for “The Shape of Water” and Meryl Streep for “The Post”. 
Greta Gerwig is getting heralded for directing “Ladybird” and is the first woman to be nominated for Best Director since 2010 and is only the fifth woman in the history of the award show to be nominated for the apparently exclusive club,
Along with Greta, Rachel Morrison is making history as the first EVER female Cinematographer nominee for her work in “Mudbound”. We are loving how these women are breaking glass ceilings and being recognized for their talents.
Other standout nominees include The Greatest Showman’s “This Is Me” for Best Original Song, Coco for Best Animated Feature and Beauty and the Beast for Best Costume Design.
We have NO clue who is going win but we have a lot of time to think about it because the Oscars isn’t until March 4.
Who do you want to see take home a win and do you think anyone got snubbed? Let us know in the comments below and then click here to see who won at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. I’m Joslyn Davis, thanks for tuning in.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again! 

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi! 

Big hugs, 

Louise xxx

Also this video was incredibly frustrating to make (lol) because we have been ordering some stuff online but I thought it would be great to like... go out in the world and get some stuff and make you guys at least like a ""Come decorate with me"" video and holy shit it is so hard to find stuff in person that you like, well maybe just me because I really am so horrible at it.  I'm just not cut from that cloth man it is a skill I do not have.  I also really wanted to do this thing called ""come nest with me"" but honestly that sounds like I'm pregnant and like I said I promise you I'm not and I promise you I'll let you know if that happens lol BUT FOR REAL NOW THAT IM THINKING ABOUT IT woah what a fucking series that would be for a pregnant lady, just going around buying a bunch of baby stuff and having like tired mini mental breakdowns from stress and then needing ice cream in the middle?!? here for that.  Sorry. Tangent.  Always, between last week and this week I am starting to feel pretty bad for not really posting a formal video if you will, but then again, maybe you like this I don't even know.  I really don't know the internet more than anybody else lol, but just know how much I appreciate your patience, love you, thanks for your understanding, and hopefully by next week I can put this table to some good use.

Here is what you'll need!

Ultimate Homemade Pizza
Makes 6 pies

INGREDIENTS

Dough
7 cups flour
4 tablespoons Kosher salt
½ teaspoon dry active yeast
4 cups water, at room temperature
Semolina or cornmeal, for the pizza peel
Extra flour, for shaping

Sauce
6 ounces tomato paste
1 cup hot water
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons maple syrup or honey
1 teaspoon salt 
½ teaspoon pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried marjoram
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

PREPARATION
In a very large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.
Make a divot in the middle of the flour mixture and add a few tablespoons of water. Stir with a wooden spoon, gradually adding more and more water until the dough starts to come together. You may need a tablespoon more or less water, depending on the consistency of the dough as it forms. 
Using your hands, ensure the dough is well incorporated, but do not knead. Be careful not to overwork the dough.
Cover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature overnight, or for at least 12 hours,  until doubled in size and porous. 
Make the sauce by combining tomato paste, water, vinegar, maple syrup, salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, basil, marjoram, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Let sit at room temperature for an hour before canning or jarring. Refrigerate as necessary up to 2 weeks. 
Once the dough has risen, transfer to a clean, floured work surface and form into a large ball. Cut the dough into 6 equal parts and form dough balls by folding the corners into themselves. 
Place the dough balls on a floured sheet pan, sprinkle with flour, and cover with a damp towel for about 30 minutes to an hour. 
Preheat oven with a pizza stone in it to 500ªF (260ºC) or a low broil. 
Work each dough into a disk on a floured work surface. Knuckling the edges of the dough and tossing it gently will help thin it out. Be careful not to rip the dough.
Place the dough disk onto a pizza peel generously floured with semolina or cornmeal. This will prevent sticking. Top with desired sauce, cheese, and toppings. 
Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake for about 9 minutes, watching carefully to make sure it doesn’t burn. Look for the edges to become charred and crispy and the cheese to bubble. 
Let the pizza cool for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

We did exactly that and, in the spirit of historical research. now present the eight weirdest things we learned while playing. Subscribe for more Assassin's Creed Origins gameplay!

For example, Khufu was the pharaoh buried in the Great Pyramid. What’s weird about Khufu’s final resting place in the Great Pyramid, however, is that although his coffin has been found, his body remains missing to this day.

The coffin was listed as being empty when it was discovered, and its design indicates that there was once a lid in place. Discovery Tour offers the possibility that the sarcophagus is only a cenotaph in memory of the pharaoh, and was never meant to receive the body.

I, however, am here to posit the alternate theory that Khufu punched his way out of his coffin and now roams the earth menacing people with his good friends Dracula and the Wolfman. You decide which you think is more plausible out of these, the only two possibilities.

Assassin’s Creed Origins’ Discovery Tour mode drops as a free update for the main game on 20 February 2018.

Katie Grand says: ""It’s always been a dream to work on an episode of The Muppets.  As a kid it was my favourite TV show and to work with Disney and their amazing people was literally ‘the dream.’  This is the fifth time I’ve worked with Kermit and Piggy, previously having worked with them with Prada, Louis Vuitton and Burberry.""

Commenting on the shoot, Rankin says: ""Working with The Muppets can only be compared to working with royalty, so #LoveMuppets was a real pinch-me moment.  When Miss Piggy deigned to talk to me, you can see in the film that I was pretty much speechless – that’s not acting!  They say, never meet your heroes, and obviously doing what I do, I’ve met a few of mine, but meeting the Muppets really took the biscuit!”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iNMvdcQUYwQ/sddefault.jpg,0.008849100900389567,0.0031990918706947705,2.7661290322580645,0.0009545677356105364,0.012048192771084338,0.013002760506694874,2017-12-25,08:30:01,Monday,0,13,40,12,40,68,339,4,64,0,1,8,31,2,1,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.187372555234426,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{},0

More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

Just days after celebs graced the Golden Globes red carpet, a very similar group (give or take a few) re-glammed and dressed to the nines yet again for the 2018 Critics Choice Awards. This year’s host Olivia Munn was on her A-game last night, bringing the jokes, the roasts and all sorts of cringe-worthy moments. Olivia awkwardly took aim at all the men from last weekend’s Golden Globes who kept rather quiet about the Time’s Up movement, and even Mark Wahlberg, after it was revealed that he was paid $1.5 million for his All The Money in the World reshoot scenes, while costar Michelle Williams was allegedly given an $80 per diem, totaling less than $1,000…

But she also gave a shout-out to the GOOD guys in Hollywood, who do things like call for meetings with actresses in conference rooms, rather than hotels. Bravo, men. As for one of the cutest moments, not just last night, but possibly in award show history, The Florida Project’s seven-year-old star Brooklyn Prince had the entire audience in tears as she went up to accept her Critics Choice Award for Best Young Performer, and was courteous enough to invite her fellow nominees to ice cream later that night…

Don’t gotta tempt me with a good time! Speaking of sweet treat celebrations, Critics Choice nominee Mary J. Blige celebrated her 47th birthday during the show last night – celebs, like Alison Brie were photographed ringing in her birthday with cake – only problem was that the cake was handed out AFTER she left for the evening… it’s the thought that counts, right?

As for shocking wins, Margot Robbie revealed she hadn’t even prepared a speech for her I, Tonya nomination in which she was pleasantly surprised to be winning. She took the stage to accept her award for Best Actress in a Comedy, and her speech was so sweet that she even had Angelina Jolie beaming with pride.

From Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television, A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE! is inspired by the holiday classic feature “A Christmas Story” and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway production “A Christmas Story: The Musical.” Marc Platt (“Grease: Live,” “La La Land,” “Wicked”) and Adam Siegel (“Grease: Live”) will executive-produce, with Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary (“Grease: Live,” “Anything but Love,” “Ira & Abby”) serving as co-executive producers and writers. Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “La La Land”) who composed the original score to “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” will compose several new songs for the LIVE television event on FOX.

Two-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick (“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “The Producers,” “Manchester by the Sea”) will star as the narrator where he will play the grown-up “Ralphie Parker,” who looks back with love and humor on his favorite childhood Christmas. Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker."" Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.

Who Invented the Chicken Nugget?

Who Really Invented the Tea Bag?
https://youtu.be/BpRCyLi5UXw?list=PLR0XuDegDqP0HjtNM-IuWjliZeLoLVNan

In this video:

On June 8, 2017, Greek-born, Canadian-bred pizza maker Sam Panopoulos died. His career slinging pies was rather unremarkable save for one notable thing – he was the inventor of the popular, yet infamous pineapple-topped “Hawaiian Pizza,” named as such because of the brand of canned fruit he used. Loved by some and hated by others, the sweet and salty pizza is so controversial that it once triggered an argument between friendly nations. While such arguments rage on both sides of it being a delicacy or an abomination, the fact is that the Hawaiian pizza is actually not Hawaiian- it’s Canadian. Here now is the story of pizza and the man who decided to add pineapples to it.

Lyrics:

Don’t know what to say to you now
Standing right in front of you
Don’t know how to fade in and out
Don’t know how to play it cool
Lose a little guard, let it down
We don’t have to think it through
We’ve got to let go

I want to give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I want to take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I want to go where the lights burn low and you’re only mine
I want to give you wild love

Tried to call you to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let’s leave the atmosphere, disappear
There’s always something left to lose

But I want to give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I want to take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I want to go where the lights burn low and you’re only mine
I want to give you wild love
(Wild, wild, wild...)

Let’s be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we’re breathless
Let’s be hopeful, don’t be broken
Let’s stay caught up in the moment 

I want to give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I want to take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I want to go where the lights burn low and you’re only mine
I want to give you wild love
Oh I said I want to give you wild love

Give you wild love, wild love, wild love, wild love

Researchers at New York University have refined the procedure, resulting in much more detailed images. LiDAR can be used in different fields to benefit communities around the world.

There is actually a specific strategy for fending off difficult questions which leaders and others in the intense public eye practice and polish to respond, without saying definitive things to which they might be held later:

---First, use some ""language placeholders,"" like ""ah,"" or ""well,"" or just a meaningless phrase like, ""that is an important question.""  This will buy your brain some time to fashion a reply.

---Answer the question you wish you were asked, rather than the one actually posed, by--

     *Starting with a bit of an answer that just brushes on the question asked, but avoids a direct response;

     *Pivoting, or spinning your reply to answer the question you wanted to receive, so you can lay out your own viewpoint on an issue of benefit to you;

     *If asked the same question more than once, in an attempt to pin you down, just keep using the technique above, of beginning your answer with a bit of a reference to the specific inquiry, and then pivoting to the information you want to present.

The above video has a classic example of this tool in use by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who dances and dodges through a set of interview questions from a reporter concerning the recently imposed U. S. Trade tariffs.

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Kenneth Kolton - Hi John , I listened to how you don't mind if there are no deaths in Infinity War due to Marvel fake killing off characters. With this film being the start of the culmination of the MCU and
Thanos as the villain, don't you think stakes should be at their highest and we could see real deaths from main characters? Thanks and bring on the filthy.

Adam Affandy - Hey John!! Love your channel. My question is, what happened to the Fortunately The Milk movie by Edgar Wright??? It was supposed to star Johnny Depp and Edgar Wright to direct. Is it dead?? Thoughts?

Greg StClair - With this year having some great Oscar potential movies, do you think there is one movie that is going to sweep the award competition or is it going to be spread out through a bunch of movies?

Andrew Odette - Happy New Year!  What are your thoughts on Jodie Foster's statements regarding the current state of movies.  She says that movies have become like an amusement park, and that studios are trying to merely appeal to the masses.  Isn't that the point?  She also says some other disparaging things.  What do you think?

PATREON Supporter Bernard - Greetings John and a Happy New Year to you and yours! So Star Wars: The Last Jedi just finished at #1 again. Became the 2nd fastest movie in history to make $500 million, crossed the Billion dollar mark and took the 2nd smallest 3rd weekend drop in movie history.

Blink once, and you might miss a whole lot of references in the new Childish Gambino video, “This Is America”! Donald Glover’s latest visual is chock full of themes and subtle messages, from the African inspired dancing, lampooning of vaudeville and blackface entertainment to the more serious tones of gun violence and terrorism. Suffice to say, you might need to watch “This Is America” more than once to fully grasp it. What did you make of the video? Is there anything we missed? Let us know in the comments below!

Kendall Jenner and Blake Griffin didn’t look like a ‘rumored’ couple when we spotted them at the 5th Quarter premiere in Beverly Hills California.

The couple looked cozy and close as the event kicked off… Blake in a casual sports coat and Kendall in a tan blazer over a sheer top and ripped jeans.

When they weren’t standing together and looking like a solid Hollywood pair, they took their time on the red carpet to smile for the cameras.

Kendall posed with Michael Ratner, the producer of the film, which is a mockumentary series chronicling the greatest untold and untrue stories in sports.

And yep, Blake Griffin is in three of the episodes.

Blake and Kylie have been linked for a while now… and she’s been spotted around town with him many occasions.

But this red carpet appearance puts all those rumors to bed if you ask us.

With this video clip we continue our 360° video series of one of the highest peak of Russia, mount Elbrus. The twin-peak mountain (5,642-meter and 5,621-meter summits) can also be considered the highest peak in Europe as it is still rather uncertain where the border between Europe and Asia lies exactly.

Nowadays you need extraordinary computer power for watching 8K 360° videos. If you have troubles with watching such videos, choose 4K or HD quality in the settings of your YouTube player. We hope that YouTube will find a solution for optimization this videoformat to make it watchable for common users.

Also here is the answer for a frequently asked question about true resolution of an 8K 360° video. Unlike standard videos, in a 360° video you can see only a part of original image (approximately 30 degrees out of 360). As result, the real resolution of the part you can see isn't bigger than 1.3K.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iUgEjlISVqg/sddefault.jpg,0.015755191967883362,0.0014860598712081445,10.601990049751244,0.0009241665865722293,0.01724125183909151,0.018165418425663736,2018-01-31,06:36:12,Wednesday,2,7,38,7,33,32,334,0,79,0,1,6,14,4,0,4.0,8.0,['Pra'],['Pra'],True,['pra'],1,1,3,0,0,0,0,4.969281320090058,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

That's called mental age. Do you wanna know yours? Lucky for you, Bright Side put together a simple test that will help you figure out if you're a carefree child, an old and wise sage or just exactly as mentally “old” as you are. Just answer our questions, write down your points for every answer, add them all up and get your results! But enough talking, let's begin! 

If you got 7-12 points, mentally you're just under 20 years old. It doesn't matter what your passport says – you’re a carefree teenager at heart! If you're way older than 20, congratulations – you've managed to carry this constant feeling of enthusiasm and love for life through all these years. Keep shining!

If your result is 13–20 points, you are 20–29 years old. You are active, creative, and full of life, but you can already call yourself an adult. Childhood and teenage years are over, but you took the best from them and left all the unnecessary stuff behind. It doesn't mean that you're not having fun though – your life is just as exciting as it was.

If all of your points added up to 21–28 points, your mental age is 30–39 years. You’re still active and curious about new things and ideas, but you are already responsible and thoughtful. If you think about it, that's the perfect balance between the children's joy for life and adults' independence. The golden mean at its best! 

If your total number of points is 29–35, you are 40–49 years old. You're mature and experienced, and you know exactly how to live your life. You have no time for nonsense – you're determined and hardworking. You know what you want and how to get it. Continue to be a true inspiration for everyone around!

36–40 points mean that your mental age is over 50 years. And that's not a bad thing at all! On the contrary, you are wise and calm. You get what life is all about, and you highly appreciate comfort. You're the person everyone goes for advice, plus you can always be trusted. These are some rare qualities today, so your friends must protect you at all costs.

So what’s your mental age and how close is it to your real age?

Uncovered Rian Johnson's hidden agenda with Kylo Ren and Rey and they over-romanticize every couple in the last movie from Finn and Rey to Rose and Finn and most importantly Rey and Kylo. I don't know why they did it but if you want a good fanfic read go pick up a copy and let me know how it turns out... #reylo

But New Orleans isn't any NFL city. This video by producer Aaron Fisher explains why, through the words of the NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune journalists who witnessed the game and the city's reaction firsthand.

Around the league, the Marcus Williams story was and is the story of an epic missed tackle. In New Orleans, it's about a 21-year-old who got knocked down, picked himself back up, and vowed to come back. That's New Orleans' story, too. Which is why instead of making him a villain, Saints fans wrapped their arms tight around Marcus Williams and said, basically: Welcome home, kid.

We hope you enjoy ""Marcus Williams: One of Us Now.""

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

To say it was an emotional 24 hours is a huge understatement. It was on our minds the entire time and I kept re-living the experience over and over in my head and had to stop to breathe through it. Hectic!. We couldn't stop thinking about what we would do if Riley did need spinal surgery again. With no x-ray machine out there we couldn't be sure what was going on inside there and all we could do is trust Riley's instincts and hope for the best.

For those interested, Riley writes a little about his broken neck here:

Contemplating, Isolating and it's stressing me out
Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?

I need a way to separate it,
But I promised you that
I'll make sure you never forget me
(Never forget me)

Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you I'm bullet proof
Believe me I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone

You're addicted and so twisted that it's freaking me out
Distant eyes it's no surprise
You can do anything now
I need a way to separate it
But I'm telling you that nothing will ever be the same

Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm to far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you I'm bullet proof
Believe me I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone...

Now that you want it,
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you I'm bulletproof
Believe me I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone

I'm telling you I'm bullet proof
Believe me I'm bulletproof

And now I'm too far gone...",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idM_ivEu1No/sddefault.jpg,0.0070278022196449035,0.00026069031538574427,26.95843230403801,0.0002445906759557458,0.007288492535030649,0.007533083210986394,2018-03-02,17:35:06,Friday,4,5,21,5,18,34,198,1,51,0,3,4,7,0,0,6.0,8.0,"['Pete srt COMET BTC', 'chile Brew imy cel eni tes']","['Pete', 'srt', 'COMET', 'BTC', 'chile', 'Brew', 'imy', 'cel', 'eni', 'tes']",True,"['pete', 'srt', 'comet', 'btc', 'chile', 'brew', 'imi', 'cel', 'eni', 'te']",10,10,35,0,0,0,0,0.4911260914080898,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

The game, as I am playing it here, has been patched with Toruzz's ""Super Mario Land 2 DX"" patch that was released on Christmas. What an excellent update to the original Game Boy game this is. The game now runs perfectly in full color on real GBC hardware, and sports a a few tweaks and options to further improve the game. For all intents and purposes, it's the same game as the original 1992 release, but after you see it, you won't want to go back to the green-screen original. 

For further info about the patch, see https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3784/

The original game was a fantastic follow-up to the original Mario launch title on the Game Boy, adapting pieces of Mario 3 and Mario World to its own unique (and at times bizarre) take on the world-famous plumber. It certainly still feels like Yokoi's style more than it does Miyamoto's. 

Anyway, this patch is fantastic. I can't imagine how much work must have gone into it - this isn't a slap-dash job with Super Game Boy style palettes globbed across everything. All of the graphics have been completely colored as individual elements and it all looks like a completely legit Nintendo Zelda DX-style upgrade for how professionally it has been done. There aren't any glitches or distortions in the graphics from the modification whatsoever - it looks like it was originally designed this way. And it makes full use of the GBC's graphics capabilities, so don't be surprised when you start to realize how just how much better it looks than an NES game. Props to Toruzz for such quality work - thanks!

In case you'd like to see the original game in all of it's green dot-matrix glory, you can find it at https://youtu.be/V2GxRfjsM30

Tú y yo a solas

[Verso 1: Cosculluela]
Ella no fuma, pero si fuma es con Maluma
A mi me llama solo cuando quiere espuma
Champaña, en el yate o en la cabaña
Las amigas dicen que con Coscu se daña


El pasaporte lleno, tiene el veneno
Pa’ hacer que cualquier hombre se tire sin frenos
Mal o bueno, de bueno pa' malo los palos
Ella los chambea pero yo soy quien los jalo

De Carola a Cayey, desde los 16
Anda con el tiguere y no es el de la caja de cornflakes
Y el del peligro, el artista principal del libro
Con solo tocarla yo la desequilibro

[Puente: Maluma]
La imagino aquí en mi cuarto susurrandome
Apoca luz tu cuerpo seduciendome
Dale atrévete, ven tócame

[Coro: Maluma]
Ya que estamos solo a solas
Déjame decirte ahora
Que tú tienes lo que me enamora
Ese booty que me descontrola

Ya que estamos solo a solas
Déjame decirte ahora
Que tú tienes lo que me enamora
Ese booty que me descontrola
Tú y yo a solas


[Verso 2: Cosculluela]
Ella con el descansa y conmigo no duerme
La cuestión se amansa cuando llega el viernes
Ella le apaga el celu en el momento exacto
Y busca al big papi entre los contactos

Allí mi celu suena y me suena, yo “Hello, ordena”
De lo que usted quiera yo lo tengo en docena
La nena la visto de cabeza al talón
Pero ella solamente pide pasarla cabrón

Salir de noche y llegar de día
Mientras le quito el broche ella aguanta el guía
Que vamos sin rumbo, en tus ojos hay amor profundo
En los míos dinero hasta que se acabe el mundo

[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Ella esta dura y tiene buen porte
Ella tiene elegancia y tiene su corte
No le cabe un sello en su pasaporte
Ella está soltera y anda sin norte

[Coro: Maluma]
Ya que estamos solo a solas
Déjame decirte ahora
Que tú tienes lo que me enamora
Ese booty que me descontrola


Ya que estamos solo a solas
Déjame decirte ahora
Que tú tienes lo que me enamora
Ese booty que me descontrola
Tú y yo a solas

Atlanta rap label Quality Control is set to drop its new compilation record Control the Streets Vol. 1 featuring the likes of Cardi B, Lil Yachty, and Young Thug. To promote the new project, Migos posted a clip of a new song on Instagram.

In one line, Quavo disses Joe Budden, a rapper and host of Everyday Struggle – “Ice tray, a n***a flooded / If a n***a hatin’ call him Joe Budden (pussy!),” he raps in the song snippet.

Back in June, Joe Budden walked out of a red carpet interview at the BET Awards with Migos – an interview so legendary it inspired countless memes. Budden took to Twitter to respond to Quavo’s diss, writing “Quavo want smoke ? Lol.”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ifmiNYqJU-Q/sddefault.jpg,0.008389932081502197,0.0011985617259288853,7.0,0.0005992808629644426,0.009588493807431082,0.010187774670395527,2017-12-12,00:44:17,Tuesday,1,16,49,14,47,85,360,2,70,0,6,14,10,1,0,4.0,6.0,"['y* e', '6B ne . ae 2', 'Ps', '—T oe Pe', 'f nas', 'raged', 'os', '', 'st a']","['y*', 'e', '6B', 'ne', '.', 'ae', '2', 'Ps', '—T', 'oe', 'Pe', 'f', 'nas', 'raged', 'os', 'st', 'a']",True,"['y*', 'e', '6B', 'ne', '.', 'ae', '2', 'Ps', '—T', 'oe', 'Pe', 'f', 'na', 'rage', 'os', 'st', 'a']",17,17,31,1,2,4,1,6.365880939709699,1,['surprised'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,{'person': 2},2

Growing up, Saturdays were everything for me. I spent the morning in front of the TV soaking up whatever caught my eye, before going out on the day's adventure. After dinner I stayed up all night surfing channels, experiencing some amazing images and sometimes some wild shit I wasn’t ready for. We may not have the freedom we once had but the feelings of Saturday’s remain.

""Saturdays"" (feat HAIM) Lyrics:

This could be the last time 
That could be the fault line slipping away 
This could be your last line
Care about everything that you say 

This might be the last ride 
Every road could fall right under our feet 
and Sink into the ocean 
This will be a lost street 

When you open your eyes 
It's like nothings real 
When you open your eyes
it's like 


Saturdays 
When we dance in the dark in the room 
Where it all gets real 
I know you know how It feels

Saturdays 
When the moonlight lit up your face 
And let love spark 

I traveled around a bit 
Makin my chrome heartsick 
No one could make me stay 
No one could make me sit

Maybe we are a fault line 
Maybe we're a phone line ready to break
Maybe you're a time bomb 
I don't care what your boyfriends say

When you lift up your head it's like nothing's real 
When you open your eyes 
It's like 

Saturdays 
When we dance in the dark in the room 
Where it all gets real 
I know you know how It feels 
Saturdays 
When the moonlight lit up your face 
And let love spark 

Did the good days go away 
in the bright lights did it fade
we were heavy 
we were sideways 
when we danced in the dark over my place
If it's my face 
you remember 
from all the Sundays in the summer 
then you'd know there was so much more than a spark 
enough to make me run and follow you in the dark 

Saturdays 
When we dance in the dark in the room 
Where it all gets real 
I know you know how It feels 

Saturdays 
When we dance in the dark in the room 
Where it all gets real 
I know you know how It feels 

Saturdays 
When the moonlight lit up your face 
And let love spark

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Who doesn’t love a good villain? Disney knows how to do them best, but there’s more to these antagonists than meets the eye. They may hurt puppies, manipulate, backstab, abuse, and much more, but these are just troubled souls whose path in life led them to be bad. Want to know the messed up origin stories of Disney’s notorious villains? Well, we got them all here for you, maybe not to excuse their wicked behaviors, but to understand it. Just like how the “Maleficent” film explored her history, we’re going to do the same.

Why was Cruella de Vil locked up by her controlling mother in the attic? Was Hades’ childhood so unfair that he must over through Zeus and Hercules? Who killed Ursula's dad from “The Little Mermaid” and how is King Triton involved? And is Claude Frollo really wicked, or is he just a fearful religious orphan? Out of The Queen of Hearts and Scar, whose parents treated them worse? Is Jafar actually the good guy? He seems to have more in common with Aladdin than we thought. And is the Stepmother from “Cinderella” just a sad widow? Lastly, the poor Gaston from “Beauty and The Beast,” suffers from a mental illness that was never treated.

Watch this video to understand the crazy stuff these antagonists had to put up. It’s no wonder they turned out the way they did. The beauty of it all, if we can explain their irrational cruelty, maybe there’s a way to prevent it...but come on, we need villains so we can have heroes, right?!

Book from Amazon -  https://www.smarturl.it/Vegan100

Here's my recipe for vegan Creme Brûlée! One of my favourite desserts before going vegan, it so simple to make!! I recommend using soy/oat cream in instead of coconut milk if you don't like the flavour of coconut, although it is very subtle. If you are placing yours under a grill make sure it's super hot, if it's a mild grill the creme has a tendency to crack. So I really recommend using a blow torch. Get adventurous with the flavours for your vegan creme brûlée's - Enjoy, Gaz

******************* ABOUT THE VIDEO ***********************

We had seen a lot of people attempting the foil ball challenge.  I watched a ton of videos on making them and it seems like a ton of hard work.  So I was thrilled when Igor at 'Inspire to Make' reached out to us and said he'd send us the one he made.  It is HUGE, about 3.5 inches in diameter.  It was really cool when we cut it in half and saw the cross section of the polished foil ball.  I didn't think it would be so dense.

But we do our own thing here, we didn't just want to cut one in half... we wanted to launch one out of a cannon at a watermelon.  And Mitchell always looks for an excuse to explode a can of easy cheese.  We go some great footage and I hope you like it.

I will be making hip hop beats, rap beats, trap beats, edm beats, and many more throughout these episodes. So enjoy and make sure to leave your thoughts in the comment section.

Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon has always talked about having a crush on Harry Styles, but told Ellen DeGeneres that Shawn Mendes has recently entered his radar. 

He told the talks show host after winning a bronze medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics QUOTE “I used to have a really huge crush on Harry Styles… But here’s the thing, I was sleeping on Shawn Mendes. I didn’t realize how cute he was. I know Harry will be upset but love is a funny thing.”

Adam attended the 90th Annual Academy Awards and the Vanity Fair party that followed on Sunday night and while I’m sure this experience would’ve been life-changing no matter what, the fact that he actually got to meet and take a selfie with Shawn is definitely the cherry on top. The 28-year-old athlete posted a picture of himself with the 19-year-old musician on Instagram and used the word ‘bruh’ to describe his emotions. 

He later uploaded the same photo to Twitter but threw in a little joke. He tweeted QUOTE “I planted the seed and I saw the harvest. He is cute, he is sweet, and the other guy is @ShawnMendes.” 

Adam was interviewed at the Oscars before he met Shawn and the host asked if the singer’s Canadian blood is a problem seeing as the United States and Canada have such a big sports rivalry. 

And just a few hours later Adam would meet the object of his affection. Can you even imagine?! 

Okay, I’m just gonna say it -- I’d do almost anything for Adam Rippon to be my best friend. Isn’t he amazing?! I wish his meeting with Shawn was caught on video, though, because I have a feeling that it was pretty memorable. Which celebrity are you dying to meet? How would you react if you got a chance to hang with him or her? Sound off in the comments below and then click here to get a recap of the 10 best moments that happened at the 2018 Academy Awards. I’m your host Sinead De Vries thanks so much for watching Clevver and I’ll see you next time.

James Franco  transforms the tragicomic true-story of aspiring filmmaker and infamous Hollywood outsider Tommy Wiseau—an artist whose passion was as sincere as his methods were questionable—into a celebration of friendship, artistic expression, and dreams pursued against insurmountable odds. Based on Greg Sestero’s best-selling tell-all about the making of Tommy’s cult-classic “disasterpiece” The Room (“The Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made”), The Disaster Artist is a hilarious and welcome reminder that there is more than one way to become a legend—and no limit to what you can achieve when you have absolutely no idea what you’re doing.

Alright guys, sorry about the brief hiatus, but we are back on track this week with videos!! 
I'm stoked as hell about this last weekend, so much so that I wanted to get these videos made and out before the ones that I was already working on for this week :D

We had a fantastic patron weekend down here in FL, and I'd like to thank everyone that made it out for one or both days to ride and hang. A MASSIVE Thanks has to be given to both Ken and Joe who really were the reason this weekend happened as they reserved a campsite and invited me out a while back. Little did they know that would turn into a whole crew sleeping over!! 

Anyway, I hope everyone is getting off on the right foot this week, and if not, well, I got you covered with a little slice of fun singletrack here. So sit back, relax, and try not to get caught by your boss while watching this at work :P

Without you,
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear
If you're not here with me
When those blue oh-snowflakes, are falling
That's when those blue memories, start calling (hey)
You'll be doin' alright, with your Christmas in white
And I'll have a blue blue blue Christmas
(Oh let's go, let's go)
And when those blue oh-snowflakes, start falling
Well that's when those blue oh-memories, start calling
You'll be doin' alright, with your Christmas all white
And I'll I'll have a blue blue blue Christmas
Yes I'll, I'll have a blue oh Christmas

Watch the official trailer for Cobra Kai, a YouTube Red Original Series. Premieres May 2! In the highly-anticipated return of two iconic characters, the arch-rivals from the legendary Karate Kid film series reunite over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament. Now living in the affluent hills of Encino, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) leads an enviable life with his beautiful family, while running a successful string of car dealerships throughout the valley. Meanwhile, his high school adversary, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), whose life has taken a rocky turn, seeks redemption by reopening the infamous Cobra Kai karate dojo. Their lives inevitably become intertwined and the rivalry is reignited, setting forth the next generation of “karate kids” in COBRA KAI, a YouTube Red Original Series. COBRA KAI is produced by Overbrook Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures Television.

Here I’m looking at not just film, but how the media in general exploits nostalgia, or rather the nostalgia of a rather specific demographic.

Now before we begin, I think I should say that I’m not really using the word ‘exploit’ in a negative way. Movie and TV makers, video game developers, writers; they know people like certain genres, stories set in certain eras and times, certain actors – and usually these things are, to varying degrees, formulated products.

Nostalgia is sentimentality we feel for a specific time – the type of feeling you might get when you find something from or that is reminiscent of the past, whether that be an object, a trope, a sound, a smell, some sort of trigger, that makes you think…

Playing as Peach is something that fans have wanted to do in the New Super Mario Bros series for years. There is a rumor that Peach was going to be playable in NSMBW but was scrapped because Nintendo had problems getting her dress to work, most likely wanted to have physics instead of hand-animating it.
Well I plan to animate the dress myself and make it look as good as I can with the animations. This will take a bit of time, plus I have other projects as well as College to worry about.

I would also like to have voice acting since the Toads have their own voice clips but I'll worry about that later.

Day is a long time Chicago businessman, entrepreneur and humanitarian. In 1987, Day, his brother Stan and some friends founded leading bicycle component supplier, SRAM Corporation. In 2005, immediately following the Indian Ocean Tsunami, Day and his wife Leah, with support from SRAM Corp and the bicycle industry, founded international non-profit World Bicycle Relief. Their first program delivered over 24,000 new bicycles to men, women and children in Tsunami impacted Sri Lanka.
 
In his TEDx talk, Day illustrates the profound transformation that takes place when a person whose primary mode of transportation is walking, is provided a bicycle. 
 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, roughly 600 million people live in rural communities where walking is the only option for many. Every day is about racing the sun, from sunup to sundown, trying to complete the day’s work before the darkness of night. Each step is a race to overcome the barrier of distance. 
 
Through his firsthand experience in the field with World Bicycle Relief, Day describes the quantum leap in productivity that occurs when students, healthcare workers and entrepreneurs are mobilized through the power of bicycles.  He illuminates why bicycles are an overlooked development solution and why there can be a world where distance is no longer a barrier to education, healthcare and economic empowerment. 
 
World Bicycle Relief employs over 100+ people in the US, Asia and Africa, and operates 5 bicycle assembly facilities in Kenya, Malawi, Angola Zambia and Zimbabwe. To date, over 350,000 specially designed, locally assembled bicycles have been distributed and over 1,700 field mechanics have been trained. In 2010, Day and World Bicycle Relief were named #12 on Barron’s list of the World‘s Top 25 Most Effective Givers. In 2015, Fast Company named World Bicycle Relief among its’ Most Innovative Companies for organizations working on the continent of Africa. Frederick (F.K.)

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

Немного об Илье:
Также известен как: Lil.HaRDy, Lil.Superstar, lilsummersoul
Илья Ильюк, 24.12.1995 (22 года) Украина

Профессиональный игрок в Dota 2.

Илья Ильюк, также известный как Lil, является одним из самых перспективных игроков на профессиональной сцене Dota 2. Его киберспортивная карьера началась в сентябре 2014 года, когда известный капитан Goblak решил собрать свою команду NVMI. Lil был найден в пабе, как один из самых скилловых игроков. Уже тогда он был известен своей игрой на Visage. Илья занял позицию саппорта и команда стала быстро набирать обороты.

18 сентября 2014 года перспективный состав подписала организация Virtus.pro. Для команды был создан самостоятельный проект Virtus.pro Polar (в январе 2015 года он стал называться ASUS.Polar). Скоро по игре и результатам он затмил собой основной состав организации. Lil, пережив несколько изменений состава, показывал стабильную игру. Комьюнити он так же запомнился привычкой продавать свои итемы в конце игры, тем самым внося разброд в статистику. За первый год своей карьеры Lil выиграл более $300 000, обогнав по этому показателю многих других титулованных и более опытных игроков.

15 апреля 2015 года проект ASUS.Polar прекратил своё существование, и команда перешла под тег Virtus.pro. На TI5 ""пятерке"" удалось дойти до 5-6 места, но в новом сезоне игра становилась всё более нестабильной. Начались изменения в составе. В марте 2016 года произошёл окончательный раскол и Lil вместе с DkPhobos покинули команду, войдя в новый микс Polarity. После провала на квалификациях к TI6 команда прекратила своё существование, а уже в августе Lil вернулся в обновлённый состав Virtus.pro.

Police quickly pinned the murder on four native teens from a local high school and convicted them on false confessions, an unreliable witness, and forged evidence. Still, the ""Fairbanks Four"" continued to maintain their innocence.

Over time, the fight for their freedom grew into a statewide movement against Alaska’s judicial system. After 18 years, the Fairbanks Four were set free—but the state still refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, the wrongfully convicted men, who were thrown in prison as teenagers, are struggling to get used to life outside after nearly two decades behind bars.

VICE trekked to Alaska to meet two members of the Fairbanks Four, the community members who rallied behind them, and the investigators who helped secure their freedom—exploring the enduring impact of their wrongful incarceration and the native community’s effort to move forward.

Now it has been an entire week of unplugging- I am back from the Caribbean! It was just wonderful. So great. I was away from all of it, and in some ways it almost felt like a dream because in an instant, here I am back again amidst all the work and responsibility!!! Literally feels like I could have imagined the entire experience! But no no. I vlogged and it all happened haha :’-) that’s what happens when you don’t do ANY sort of work for a week straight.

So grateful that I was able to go on a trip, it was worth it, even if coming back means catching up on work. I hope you had a great weekend, a wonderful Easter and that we will make April a good month! Thank you for coming along with me, it is so great that I could share bits of my life with you. Please please take care, breathe deeply and embrace all that makes life worth living. The little things, too, are just wonderful. The sunshine, waking up to breakfast, coming home to a bed… so grateful.

See you soon,

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwkc1SoNcD8/sddefault.jpg,0.01374568497250012,0.0002949961281758177,46.59615384615386,0.0005673002464919571,0.01404068110067594,0.014607981347167898,2018-03-19,00:32:59,Monday,0,17,52,16,50,94,484,3,121,2,3,11,0,4,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6474568816926025,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

This video will show you 3 powerful ways to love yourself unconditionally. I'm going to share with you ways that you can apply in your own life today to start to see yourself as somebody that is worthy of love and actually being yourself. 

This video will show you three powerful ways to love yourself unconditionally. I'm going to share with you ways that you can apply in your own life today to start to see yourself as somebody that is worthy of love and actually being yourself. 

Welcome back to the video. My name is Aaron and I hope people expand their consciousness on this video. I'm going to be sharing with you those three ways that you can apply in your life that can really allow you to love yourself 100 percent. Now understand that when you love yourself 100 percent you then give the opportunity for other people to love you as well. Now there may be some people that love you no matter what. That are unconditional with it. But many times we get a reflection of who we are being. So if we don't appreciate who we are and we're not focused on we know what we're grateful for for ourselves and many times people will kind of be blind to it. Understand that when you go out into public you are projecting your self image out and the emotions you feel about yourself are contagious to other people. So to have magnetic energy and to really have you know the ability for people to love you you must first love yourself. Now normally it's kind of counterintuitive you would think that in order to love yourself it's more about taking on these new perspectives of Pioline on you know these things that are good about yourself and that can be powerful. 

But the key is not so much on the piling on it's more about the letting go. You see the reason I say this is because love and unconditional love is actually our natural state of being when we are born. Now I know that sounds kind of weird because you know it seems so unnatural for us to love ourselves but understand that that's based on conditioning. We've been conditioned to not love ourselves. We've been conditioned to have all these rules as to how we can love ourselves and why we should or why we should and we've had all these magazine companies and all these advertisements that show the perfect models of how we're supposed to be and if we're not you know we need some type of pills. We need some type of weight loss formula in order to look exactly like them you see but that's just conditioning. 

That's not really true. We think it's true. We might think it's true we might buy into it and that's where some of the pain might come from. But love is our natural state of being. I believe that love is everyone's natural state of being that when we put labels in our mind when we're focused on other perspectives we create barriers between ourselves and that causes a lot of the problems we have in the world. But get back to the core of who you are and the reason I say this is because when you realize that your natural state of love it's less about shrine and it's more about just letting go letting go of perspectives that no longer serve. Letting go of all the baggage that we may have been carrying around imagine you've been walking around with other people's baggage other people's beliefs of when we grew up we were picking up these baggage as we were walking around with other people's beliefs and we're lugging them around on our back. 

And it's so tiresome to bring them everywhere we go. But now what we're learning is that we can let them go that they're not really even our beliefs. They were just things that we picked up that we thought we identified with we thought oh I'm supposed to pick this up and to carry this around. This is what everyone else is doing. Everyone else is carrying luggage around looking to hire some armfuls to do the same thing. What I'm encouraging you in this video is that you can let that luggage go. You can realize self-love is your natural state of being and that as you start to understand this you can let go of everything that is answer. 

Now the first powerful way to really love yourself is to forgive yourself. Now of course you can forgive other people for everything they've done. But let me tell and share with you the most powerful way I've found to forgive other people and to forgive even myself is having the perspective that wherever I was in my life when I made a certain decision that was where I was at. And that was the decision I needed to make in...

The yearly Super Bowl is kind of a big deal for sports fan, but everyone can enjoy the famous halftime show. However, although the NFL and the FCC try their best, it sometimes fails to be completely family friendly. We will take you through ten performances that are definitely not safe for kids. Of course, there is the infamous Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake debacle, but some feel that what Kid Rock did on stage is even more offensive. Madonna managed to perform without offending anyone, but the same couldn’t be said for M.I.A who made a very inflammatory gesture at the audience. Beyoncé put on an amazing performance, but paired it with a political statement that many people, including law enforcement, felt was unnecessarily inflammatory. It takes a lot to make Slash from Guns N’ Roses uncomfortable, but we think that Fergie managed with her inappropriate dance moves, and tone deaf rendition of Sweet Child O’ Mine.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ix_KKbdZU_o/sddefault.jpg,0.013377467542490609,9.26132368326273e-05,144.44444444444446,0.0004836469034592759,0.013470080779323237,0.013953727682782514,2017-11-23,09:35:00,Thursday,3,8,38,8,33,45,334,0,79,0,1,7,14,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.049185497220857,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Ford Flathead V8 Engine Model:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2537602

In 1932 Ford introduced the mass market to V8 engines, sticking a 3.6L flathead V8 producing a terrifying 65 horsepower in the Model 18. The engine lived on until 1953, until being finally replaced in 1954. 

What was so special about the flathead V8? Mostly the simplicity of the design. Instead of complicated cylinder heads, they were now simply a single piece of relatively flat metal (flat head). This drove the cost of the engine down, allowing it to be built and sold on a larger scale. 

The challenge, however, is that the engine suffered from poor airflow, especially at high RPM. In this video we'll discuss the valvetrain, and how the flathead design impedes airflow for high revving, high power engines. Not only was airflow a challenge, but the compression ratio was difficult to increase without further restrictions on airflow. Ultimately, improved technologies replaced the flathead in 1954.

Shot handheld from my driveway with a Canon Vixia HF G20.  

I heard about the scheduled launch 30 minutes prior and pulled up the SpaceX webcast on my laptop a few minutes before. 

At T minus a few minutes I decided on a whim to grab the camera.  Didn't think to turn auto-focus off (oops).
  
We're approximately 100 miles SE as the crow flies from Vandenberg.  Local sunset was approximately 40 minutes before launch, making for spectacular lighting conditions. 

My video starts around T + 1:31 at which point the Falcon 9 is going approx. 2145 Km/h and is at an altitude of 19Km.

At 40 Seconds into my video where the Falcon 9 crosses the contrail of a passing plane, the Falcon 9 is going approximately 5,000 Km/h and is at an altitude of 47Km....WELL above the passing plane that is probably at an altitude range of 5-10Km.

SUMMARY
this is all thanks to something you’ve probably heard of called acupressure. It’s been used to heal different ailments since ancient times, and it appeared in Asia over 5,000 years ago! The basis of this practice is a belief that the human body is made up of ""chi"" energy, and this energy flows freely through the body along invisible channels called ""meridians"". If the meridians get blocked, an illness appears in the place of the blockage. Acupressure can help unblock these sort of ""traffic jams"" in your body and make it work even better than before.

We showed off the amazingly cheap but well made knives offered by gearbest.com in an earlier. unsponsored video - it must have worked well for that site as they now offered us sponsorship. 

They sent is eight folding knives we picked, and then we went ahead and build what probably is the world's first folding knife jousting machine...

A machine that can clash blade against blade so hard even the best folders in the world will suffer. Watch how the products (all of them under 16 € end user price) fare against this most brutal machine. 

The semi finals are planned for Dec. 6th, 2017, and the finals will be on the 10th of Dec., 2017. Stay tuned, and leave us your best bet in the comments!

Bannon was on Capitol Hill testifying before the House Intelligence Committee when the news broke that Mueller had issued the subpoena for the now-estranged associate of President Donald Trump to testify before a grand jury.
Bannon's testimony on the Hill on was his first appearance before any of the congressional committees investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election or potential coordination with Trump's associates, and it comes just days after the White House broke with Bannon over comments attributed to him disparaging Trump and the Trump family.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j-7vaRXwQMk/sddefault.jpg,0.008106911172529176,0.0011235678610384393,7.2153284671532845,0.0062206293620266865,0.009230479033567615,0.015451108395594304,2018-01-16,19:55:53,Tuesday,1,6,19,6,19,49,165,2,31,1,1,2,3,0,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.458928825937494,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

Ek Tera Naam Rahein Meri Zubaan Pe

The Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea were 17 years in the making.
And tonight, after 17 thrilling days of competition and dazzling spectacle, the Games come to an end.
A closing ceremony will be held this evening at 8 p.m., Korea time -- that's 6 a.m. eastern time in the U.S. and 11 a.m. in London.
With more, our Lee Ji-won is standing by at the PyeongChang Olympic Plaza.
Ji-won, how's the atmosphere there, and can you tell us what's in store at the closing ceremony?

Jiyeon, the last few games of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics all finished earlier in the day, and many people have already gathered around the Olympic Plaza for the final ceremony.
About that ceremony -- it will, again, be a flurry of performances, but this time more focused on South Korea's modern culture, including K-pop, under the theme ""The Next Wave,"" which represents determination to face the challenges ahead. 
The line-up includes K-pop stars like CL and EXO, and at one point, taking to the stage will be the organizing committee of the next Winter Games to be held in Beijing.
There will be a reprise of the record-breaking drone show in the night sky of Pyeongchang that grabbed everyone's attention at the opening ceremony,... and athletes will, again, march in to the stadium, including the unified Team Korea. 
And to cheer for them, South Korean president Moon Jae-in, will be present together with the vice chair of the North Korean ruling party's central committee, Kim Yong-chol,... along with the United States' first daughter Ivanka Trump and China's Vice Premier Liu Yandong.

Well Ji-won, the cold was a concern at the opening ceremony, but how's the temperature looking for the closing?

Ji-yeon, the temperature is going to drop to around minus two degress Celsius, with the real-feel temperature at around minus five degrees. With winter nearing its end, it doesn't seem as cold as it was during the opening ceremony.
Regardless, the organizing committee still has winter gear prepared for the spectators, including blankets and raincoats.
This isn't actually the end of the PyeongChang Winter Games, though.
The Olympics are over, but the Paralympics will start on March 9th and run for 10 days. So make sure to tune in for more action on the slopes and on the ice coming up in less than two weeks.
Back to you Jiyeon.

블락비가 다른 그룹들과 가장 차별화되는 지점은 멤버 전원이 프로듀싱 능력을 갖췄다는 것. 그간 지코가 앨범 프로듀싱을 도맡다시피 한 것은 블락비만의 색깔을 확고히 하는 과정이었다. 그리고 이제 유닛과 솔로를 통해 역량을 키워온 멤버들을 통해 다양한 변주를 시작했다.

'쉘 위 댄스(Shall We Dance)'로 신나게 놀았던 블락비가 차분한 감성으로 돌아왔다. 리패키지 앨범 '리몽타주(Re:MONTAGE)'는 지난 11월 발표한 여섯 번째 미니앨범 '몽타주(MONTAGE)'와는 결이 다르다. 마치 동전의 앞뒷면처럼 전혀 다른 블락비의 매력을 느낄 수 있다.

'리몽타주'의 타이틀곡 '떠나지마요'는 박경이 프로듀싱했다. 싱글 '보통연애' '자격지심' '오글오글'에 미니앨범 '노트북'까지 직접 작사, 작곡, 프로듀싱을 하며 '믿고 듣는 박경'이라는 수식어를 얻은 그는 자신이 가장 잘 하는 방식으로 블락비의 애절한 감성을 끄집어냈다.

화려함을 걷어내니 멤버들의 목소리는 더 깊고 묵직하게 다가온다. 에너제틱한 블락비와는 전혀 다른 모습이지만 조금의 이질감도 느껴지지 않는다. 그만큼 멤버들 각각의 목소리에 힘이 있고 전해지는 울림이 있다. 무엇보다 개성 있는 7명의 목소리가 완벽한 앙상블을 이룬다.

여기에 재효의 솔로곡 '마지막 정류장'과 유권이 작사에 참여한 한국 첫 솔로곡 '에브리싱(Everythin)'이 수록된 것도 리패키지앨범 '리몽타주'의 특별함이다.



1. 떠나지마요
'떠나지마요'는 미디엄 템포의 곡으로 떠나보낸 이를 그리워하며 과거의 일들을 후회하고 되짚어보는 애절한 마음을 담았다. 멤버들 각 개인의 보이스컬러가 잘 드러나 있고, 일곱 명의 목소리가 완벽한 앙상블을 이룬다. 자극적이지 않은 편안한 멜로디가 잔잔한 울림을 준다.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0VZtMVAxg4/sddefault.jpg,0.016456315657239384,0.0001326691130267948,124.04029304029305,0.0002359371955110215,0.016588984770266182,0.0168249219657772,2017-12-12,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,7,38,7,33,38,334,0,79,0,1,7,14,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['aces', ': ae', '', 'OOSEYELT;', '', '       ', '', '— a a']","['aces', ':', 'ae', 'OOSEYELT;', '—', 'a', 'a']",True,"['ace', ':', 'ae', 'ooseyelt', ';', '—', 'a', 'a']",8,7,18,2,0,0,2,6.288093871085656,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 2}",3

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

Intro
Cuando yo la vi

Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
Estás dura mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
Estás dura, dímelo dímelo ¿cómo es que es?
Estás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
Estás dura, dura, dura
Becky G
Buscate limon y el Tequi
que así es como que se prende Becky

But with our growing population and global demand for animal products increasing, raising such huge numbers of animals for food poses serious challenges. But, what if we could have our meat and eat it too? Enter clean meat—real meat, grown without animals—which has now moved from science fiction to science fact. Paul Shapiro serves as the vice president of policy for The Humane Society of the United States, the world’s largest animal protection organization. In 1995, Shapiro founded Compassion Over Killing as a high school club, building it into a national organization over the next decade. An inductee into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame, Shapiro has published dozens of articles about animal welfare in publications ranging from daily newspapers to academic journals. He’s also the author of a forthcoming book on the clean meat movement (Simon & Schuster’s Gallery Books). This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The powerful, steam-driven explosion occurred at 4.17am on Thursday and started spewing large amounts of volcanic ash and smoke from Kilauea's crater on Hawaii's Big Island, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The National Weather Service also issued an ashfall advisory warning after radars showed the massive plume, which shot higher than the peak of Mount Everest. The eruption could not only enshroud large areas of the Big Island in volcanic ash and smog but other Hawaiian Islands and potentially distant areas if the plume reaches up into the stratosphere and ash is carried by winds. The explosion came after two weeks of volcanic activity and the opening of more than a dozen fissures east of the crater that spewed lava into neighborhoods, forcing 2,000 people to evacuate.

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

Join me in the ICU, meet some amazing ICU nurses and hear about what doctors can do to annoy them! 

As a resident, our rotations typically last 1 or 2 months in a given location. That means that I need to learn how the team works, how people communicate, where things are on the unit, in addition to managing patients! It can be a bit overwhelming and uncertain at the beginning. You do notice that some residents fit in easily, while others can develop negative reputations. I believe everyone is coming in with good intentions, trying to be the best doctor and team member possible... so what goes wrong?

The reason this is so important is because better communication and team work will hopefully reflect in better patient care! 


0:42  Introduce yourself
1:13  Don't take over the nurse's work station

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

A slave auction - in 2017. The video aired last week on CNN, confirming what had come out in a long string of reports and testimony: that Libyans were preying on sub-Saharan migrants trying to make their way to Europe. A nation with rival governments and a whole myriad of militias has been prey to lawlessness since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi. But this reportedly happened in the capital, Tripoli. After the outrage that's seen demonstrations and the recalls of ambassadors, what next?

“This morning dense ballistic blocks up to 60 cm (2 feet) across were found in the parking lot a few hundred yards from Halemaumau,” wrote the USGS in its advisory. “These reflect the most energetic explosions yet observed and could reflect the onset of steam-driven explosive activity.” Halemaumau is an active pit crater nestled within the larger summit caldera of Kilauea.

No damage or injuries have been reported, but the USGS is closely monitoring the projectile rock risk. Additional steam-driven explosions are expected, and it’s possible they could be even more powerful. It’s been nearly a century since KIlauea has hurled rocks like this, according to the USGS.

“During steam-driven explosions, ballistic blocks up to 2 m [6.5 feet] across could be thrown in all directions to a distance of 1 km (0.6 miles) or more. These blocks could weigh a few kilograms (pounds) to several tons,” the USGS said. “Smaller (pebble-size) rocks could be sent several kilometers (miles) from Halemaumau, mostly in a downwind direction.”

https://www.opb.org/news/article/washington-oregon-sales-income-tax-comparison/

Washington and Oregon
Both of the bordering states in these United States like to talk a lot of trash about each other, but they have a lot in common
Both began as part of Oregon Territory, established by the United States in 1848 after originally being inhabited by Native Americans, the Russians, a even the British for a bit.
Both border the Pacific Ocean and are in the infamous Ring of Fire, an area where lots of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions tend to occur. Both are geographically diverse.
And yep, both have similar climates. West of the Cascades, the mountain range that runs north-south through both of the states, gets a lot of rain and the temperature is more moderate, whereas east of the Cascades is much drier with varied temperatures. That’s why you’ll get a picture like this, where you’re in the rainforest, and then drive east five hours and get a picture like this, where you’re basically in the freaking desert. 
Both are known for wine.
Some of the best wine in the world is produced from the grapes grown in the Willamette Valley in Oregon and the Yakima Valley, Walla Walla Valley, and Tri-Cities region of Washington. Speaking of alcohol, both states have a ton of craft beer breweries, although Oregon has more per capita than Washington.
Both states have a similar poverty rate and similar income levels, although Washington citizens definitely earn more, on average.
The cost of living is similar in both states, overall, which is higher than most of the rest of the country.
Both states’ biggest industries are healthcare, retail, and manufacturing, in that order, but you can’t mention the two states without their lumber production. They’ve got mad forests, there, I’m telling you.
A lot of people in both Oregon and Washington have lighter skin. Only 4% in Washington and 2% in Oregon consider themselves African American.
Around ⅕ of Oregon residents and Washington residents can trace their ancestry to Germany. Many of the earliest residents of European ancestry of both states came via the Oregon Trail, from the Midwest. 
Marijuana is legal in both states, although the laws that regulate it are less strict in Oregon.
Both states lean to the left politically, and typically vote Democratic. Although the Cascades split both states politically, as east of them people tend to be more conservative.
Both states are not that religious. Less residents belong to churches in Oregon and Washington than nearly all other states.

Both border a foreign country. Washington borders Canada to the north and Oregon borders California to the south. Wait a sec...apparently California is also part of the United States. Scratch that, I’m sorry.

So what about their differences? I mean, there are a lot of differences when you nitpick, like the fact that Washington produces much more apples than any other state and Oregon produces more hazelnuts than any other state, but in general terms, there are few major differences.

Washington has a lot bigger population, despite being ⅔ the size of Oregon. Washington has around 7.3 million people, and Oregon just 4.1 million. So that’s why Washington gets 12 votes in the Electoral College and Oregon gets just 7. Washington’s population is also growing more quickly than Oregon’s.
Washington residents are smarter than Oregon residents. Ok, I joke here, obviously. However, more than 41% of Washington residents have a college degree, whereas just under 38% of Oregon residents have one.

The best moments of the Season 2017-2018 by Blake Griffin (Detroit Pistons)!

AIR Highlights provides opinionated lists of many different NBA Players top plays as well as other lists relating to the NBA or the game of basketball. I strive to create a a fair and unbiased list of plays but at the same time, everyone has their own opinion on lists and no opinion is right or wrong.

I judge plays based on the context of the situation, the overall difficulty, and how aesthetically pleasing the play is.  It's just too hard to define plays but I try my best to make that differentiation when I make these countdowns.

Be sure to subscribe if you like our lists and want to see more. Also, comment on what player's top 10 you want to see next!

Still learning from my mistakes when it comes to videos and now I know that I have to check my camera settings before recording ! The lighting is a bit different than the previous ones but hang on with me ! lol

I've always been obsessed with Anime and mostly villains in anime. When everybody was fan girling about Sailor moon and her squad, I was obsessed with the Evil queen and all those powerful mean woman she had to fight against. So this look is my take on this :-) 

To achieve this look I had the opportunity to try a wig from WWW.PRINCESSWIG.COM
The link for the wig: https://goo.gl/Q3sthn

Thank you to their team for sending me this amazing wig! I always has been scared to try crazy colors on synthetic wigs because I always think that it will most likely look fake, shiny and just overall very messy. Well this wig has not only an AMAZING lace front but the shine and density is amazing. The lace front is dense in the back and has some individual hair added in the front to have a progressive hairline which makes it super realistic! 
I would definitely recommend you to order from them! 

They also gave me a promo code for my followers to use, so help yourself (no I'm not commissioned on it, it's just genuine lol) NICKYDOLL10

Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it’s a little more complicated: he’s yet to tell his family or friends he’s gay and he doesn’t actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing. Directed by Greg Berlanti (Dawson’s Creek, Brothers & Sisters), written by Isaac Aptaker & Elizabeth Berger (This is Us), and based on Becky Albertalli’s acclaimed novel, LOVE, SIMON is a funny and heartfelt coming-of-age story about the thrilling ride of finding yourself and falling in love.

Cast: Nick Robinson, Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg, Miles Heizer, Keiynan Lonsdale, Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, Tony Hale.

Directed by: Greg Berlanti

Screenplay by: Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger

Produced by: Wyck Godfrey and Marty Bowen

I document my life as an author, presenter, blogger and columnist, but most importantly my roles as wife to Tom and mum to Buzz and Buddy.

Each Friday at 9AM I upload a new video in a series called DEAR CARRIE, essentially video diaries to my sister in law who we never get to see. Tom adds his thoughts into the mix on Sundays with Carrie replying on Wednesdays. 

Monday's is MUMDAYS - with new uploads going live every Monday morning at 9AM. Seeing as I'm expecting baby number three I'm sure there'll be a lot of updates while we wait for our new arrival. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhdL...

Tuesdays is home to the HAPPY MUM, HAPPY BABY vidcast, with new episodes going live at 5pm. We didn't film last series and kept it just as a podcast, so it's nice to have series two on this platform too!

LETRA

[Intro: Justin Quiles]
Siempre pendiente al money como Tony
Me está mirando raro, ella es tan funny
Me quedo en el strip club pa'l ceremony
Pega to' el efectivo, back that ass on me

[Coro: Justin Quiles & Brytiago]
Yo te lo dije que ese culo es pa' mí
Modélame tus pantisitos Tommy
Ven, gánate to' este dinero fácil
En ese tubo yo sé que eres ágil
Yo te lo dije que ese culo es pa' mí
Modélame tus pantisitos Tommy
Ven, gánate to' este dinero fácil
En ese tubo yo sé que eres ágil

[Verso 1: Brytiago]
Tenemo' un pacto, fumamo' pasto
Los ojos rojo' y no son lentes de contacto
La baby está esperando el momento exacto
Y cuando se baja del tubo, la cojo la amarro y la rapto

Siempre que llega a janguear, está borracha y se bebió la barra
Me abre las piernas, haciendo' un split
Me mata cómo se me espatarra'
Si me besa, lo agarra
De su flow la embarra
En el celu como Chritsian Grey
Porque soy quien la muerde y la amarra

[Coro: Justin Quiles & La Exce]
Yo te lo dije que ese culo es pa' mí
Modélame tus pantisitos Tommy
Ven, gánate to' este dinero fácil
En ese tubo yo sé que eres ágil
Yo te lo dije que ese culo es pa' mí
Modélame esos pantisitos Tommy
Ven, gánate to' este dinero fácil
Trepa' en el tubo yo sé que eres ágil

[Verso 2: La Exce]
Me dijo un nombre falso pa' no delatarse
Eso es grandes ligas, cuarto bate
Es cría en la calle, pero es alta clase
'Toy loco por con ese culo hacer un disparate

Anoche conté treinta y dos y ella me ayudó
Y al otro día fui, se lo tiré to'
Tú no tienes cojones ni balas
Ni pico ni pala
Esta no es la movie, esta es la antesala

[Coro: Justin Quiles]
Yo te lo dije que ese culo es pa' mí
Modélame tus pantisitos Tommy
Ven, gánate to' este dinero fácil
En ese tubo yo sé que eres ágil

[Verso 3: Gigolo]
Boo-boo
El dinero llueve por cómo lo mueve
Easy money, dinero fácil desde los diez y nueve
Bendice y es blessed, no lo que crees
Moviendo el culo, yo te pes, oh yes

Las pacas son de veinte y de cien
Whiskey, champaña también
¿Qué tú eres quien? ¿andas con quién? ¿quién?
Me estás mirando raro, pero es que yo esoy claro
Chambeo, apunto y disparo
Nosotros sí somos caro'

[Puente: Gigolo]
Boo-boo
Porque esto es easy money, easy money
Cuando quieras llamarme, you just gotta call me
Me quedo en el strip club pensando en money
Me gasto el efectivo, y fuck off everybody

[Coro: Justin Quiles & La Exce]
Yo te lo dije que ese culo es pa' mí
Modélame tus pantisitos Tommy
Ven, gánate to' este dinero fácil
En ese tubo yo sé que eres ágil

News release: https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/long-term-warming-trend-continued-in-2017-nasa-noaa

Global temperatures in 2017 were second only to 2016, which still holds the record for the hottest year; however, 2017 was the warmest year on record that did not start with an El Nino weather pattern, as the previous two years did. In a separate, independent analysis, NOAA scientists found that 2017 was the third-warmest year in their record. The minor difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement.

At the time of the event, Cdr Fravor was the Commanding Officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41, flying the newest aircraft in the U.S Navy, the F/A-18F Super Hornet.  Commander Fravor had 16 years of experience flying tactical aircraft for the Navy with over 3,500 flight hours and was a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School, better known as TOPGUN.

On November 14th, 2004, CDR Fravor and his WSO were flying with another Super Hornet from VFA-41 on a routine training mission that was focusing on Air Defense of the carrier battle group.  The weather was clear, sunny and a beautiful southern CA day.  

Soon after the two aircraft joined together as a flight, CDR Fravor was told that the training event was going to be suspended and that real world tasking would take precedence.  The flight of 2 Super Hornets were to investigate an unknown aerial contact.  The contact was one of many that had been descending from above 80,000 feet and hovering around 20,000 ft during the previous 2 weeks.  This was the first time that the contacts were seen with aircraft airborne.    

An aircraft that launched just prior to CDR Fravor’s aircraft landing aboard USS Nimitz managed to obtain video footage of the object. That footage is FLIR1, which was previously released by To The Stars Academy and verified as official USG footage by NYT.

Read further analysis, including a written report from the other fighter pilot flying alongside CDR Fravor the day of the Nimitz on our Community of Interest on https://coi.tothestarsacademy.com/2004-uss-nimitz-pilot-interview/.

Fibropapillomatosis (FP for short), likely caused by a herpesvirus and spread by parasites, often results in large, crippling tumors. The resulting blindness, immobility, and other impairments can end in death. The center has surgically treated many sea turtles, but that brings other risks, like secondary infection. Working with the University of Florida the hospital has now employed electrochemotherapy, which allows local treatment with anti-tumor agents, sparing the body extra exposure. Electric pulses help affected cells take the agents in. FP afflicts all green sea turtle populations. This procedure could offer them a better future.

""Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon on Tuesday morning went behind closed doors with the House Intelligence Committee to testify in the panel’s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.

Bannon, who joined the Trump campaign in August of 2016, is expected to face a grilling on comments he made to Michael Wolff, the author of a controversial new book about the Trump White House.
Bannon told Wolff that a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between campaign officials and a Russian lawyer believed to have political dirt on Hillary Clinton was “treasonous.””*

In the last video of 2017 I showed you Lambert’s long but easy-to-motivate 1761 proof that pi is irrational. For today’s video Marty and I have tried to streamline an ingenious proof due to the famous French mathematician Charles Hermite into the hopefully simplest and shortest completely self-contained proof of the irrationality of pi. There are a few other versions of this proof floating around and we’ve incorporated the best ideas from these versions into what I’ll show you today; I’ll list some of these other versions below. I also talk about the problem of pi + e and pi x e being irrational at the end of the video, really nice stuff.

Articles to check out:
Ivan Niven’s simple proof (we essentially use his sequence of integers)  https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183510788

A really nice article by Li Zhou http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1929. Among many other things this article, has an introductory section on the origins of the strange integral at the core of the proof that I am presenting in this video.

Another article by Li Zhou http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1933. (the 6 line proof of Theorem 2 is essentially what I am presenting in this video).

All these articles are great, but I think the one article that deserves most credit for having brought Hermite’s beautiful proof to the attention of the wider mathematical community is this article by Jan Stefvens: Zur Irrationalität von pi, Mitt. Math. Ges. Hamburg 18 (1999), 151-158. This one also has a very nice account of Lambert’s and Niven’s proofs.

In the video I mention that another version of this proof made an appearance in the toughest Australian maths exam in 2003; here is the link to this exam

As usual thanks to Marty and Danil for all their help with this video.
