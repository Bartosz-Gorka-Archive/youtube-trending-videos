After draining his life savings to enter a team in the Rucker Classic street ball tournament in Harlem, Dax (Lil Rel Howery) is dealt a series of unfortunate setbacks, including losing his team to his longtime rival (Nick Kroll).  Desperate to win the tournament and the cash prize, Dax stumbles upon the man, the myth, the legend UNCLE DREW (NBA All-Star Kyrie Irving) and convinces him to return to the court one more time. The two men embark on a road trip to round up Drew's old basketball squad (Shaquille O’Neal, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Nate Robinson, and Lisa Leslie) and prove that a group of septuagenarians can still win the big one.

After a successful five years as a fan-favorite digital episodic series, originally conceived by Pepsi, UNCLE DREW, will hit theaters June 29, 2018.

UNCLE DREW is a Summit Entertainment release produced by Temple Hill in association with PepsiCo’s Creators League Studios.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0G7OSgJLCqM/sddefault.jpg,0.012356869854574279,0.00018050683179117715,68.45652173913044,0.0006670904653152199,0.012537376686365457,0.013204467151680676,2018-06-13,04:00:00,Wednesday,2,17,60,16,58,97,502,5,106,0,3,15,41,2,1,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.792903648611072,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

【ポケモン映画が、新たな一歩を踏み出す――。】
20周年記念作品「キミにきめた！」の大ヒットから1年――。監督を始めとする制作陣に若き才能が加わり、全く新しいポケモン映画「みんなの物語」が遂に誕生。この夏、みんなと一緒に、まだ誰も見たことのない冒険へ向かって、キミも一歩を踏み出そう！

■ストーリー
人々が風と共に暮らす街・フウラシティでは、1年に1度だけ開催される“風祭り”が行われていた。祭りの最終日には伝説のポケモン・ルギアが現れて、人々はそこで恵みの風をもらう約束を、昔から交わしていたという。

ポケモン初心者の女子高生、リサ。
嘘がやめられなくなってしまったホラ吹き男、カガチ。
自分に自信が持てない気弱な研究家、トリト。
ポケモンを毛嫌いする変わり者のおばあさん、ヒスイ。
森の中で一人佇む謎の少女、ラルゴ。

偶然、風祭りに参加していたサトシとピカチュウは、5人の仲間たちと出会う。それぞれが悩みを抱え、パートナーのポケモンと一歩を踏み出せない中、みんなが出会うことで、運命の歯車が動き出す……。ルギアとの約束は守られるのか？ そして幻のポケモン・ゼラオラの正体とは？

今、人とポケモン、みんなの絆が奇跡を起こす――。

Frances McDormand and Gary Oldman just gained some shiny new hardware, aaaand we can’t imagine their wins slowing down anytime soon, considering both recipients have now come out on top at both The Golden Globes and at tonight’s SAG Awards. Frances McDormand received her second award of the year for her portrayal of Mildred Hayes, a mother who’s determined to solve the case of her daughter’s mysterious murder, in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. Frances’ performances has clearly resonated with so many people and critics, and I gotta agree- she’s extremely deserving of her win tonight. Plus, any opportunity to see her strut to the stage is so worth it. 
Told you. In her acceptance speech, Frances gave all credit to the writer and director of Thee Billboards, Martin McDonagh, before making a powerful, yet still hilarious statement about awarding young, up and coming actors.
Bye. She’s just the best. 
Celebrating alongside her tonight is Gary Oldman who accepted his SAG award for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. And he may be celebrating even more than Frances, because believe it or not, tonight marked his very first SAG award ever. As Gary took to the stage, he immediately became emotional, recognizing just how talented his fellow nominees are with a perfect quote by Winston Churchill.
He went on to say QUOTE “You have given enormously tonight and I am so deeply, deeply honored and proud to receive this magnificent award.” Something about Gary Oldman crying makes me want to cry. Is that just me? 
Alright guys, it’s time for you to share your thoughts on the winners’ for best performance at the SAG awards, so drop it down in the comments. Then you can click right here to find out who took home SAG awards for best supporting actor and actress. I’m Sinead de Vries, thanks so much for turning in, and I’ll see you guys soon right here on Clevver News.

After draining his life savings to enter a team in the Rucker Classic street ball tournament in Harlem, Dax (Lil Rel Howery) is dealt a series of unfortunate setbacks, including losing his team to his longtime rival (Nick Kroll).  Desperate to win the tournament and the cash prize, Dax stumbles upon the man, the myth, the legend UNCLE DREW (NBA All-Star Kyrie Irving) and convinces him to return to the court one more time. The two men embark on a road trip to round up Drew's old basketball squad (Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Nate Robinson, and Lisa Leslie) and prove that a group of septuagenarians can still win the big one.

Being in the public eye can be draining, but it doesn’t stop some celebs from behaving like children. In addition to having a name that starts with “K,” Kanye West fits right in with the Kardashians because of his penchant for drama and complete lack of empathy for others. Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber both have a lot of growing up to do, and that’s even harder to achieve when they just keep getting back together. Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Kris Jenner love using social media, but they need to learn that lying to make yourself look better is so immature. Having a child usually forces you to grow and mature, unless of course, you’re former Teen Mom star, Farrah Abraham. Tori Spelling seems to think the more kids she has the more problems will be solved, but that hasn’t helped her with her philandering husband and mounting debt.

The Philadelphia Eagles are your Super Bowl LII Champions. Quarterback Nick Foles earned MVP honors after throwing for 373 yards, 3 touchdowns, and one interception that wasn’t his fault. Tom Brady had over 500 yards passing, but lost because he couldn’t cheat. Head coach Doug Pederson called a tremendous game for the Philly offense, and Brandon Graham made a clutch strip sack late in the 4th quarter to keep New England from mounting a comeback. Nick Foles also caught a TD pass late in the second quarter. Trey Burton was the QB on that play.

I’m not sure if anyone thought this game would be an offensive shootout, but Rob Gronkowski, Chris Hogan, James White, Alshon Jeffery, LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement, & Zach Ertz all scored touchdowns in the game. Bill Belichick and company tied the Denver Broncos for most Super Bowl losses with 5. The 2018 portion of the NFL season has proved to be very exciting, and concluded nicely with the Philly Underdogs getting a Super Bowl 52 win. ""Coach has got some guts!"" That's what Eagles tight end Trey Burton thought after hearing the Eagles' play call of ""Philly Special"" on fourth-and-goal late in the first half of the Eagles' Super Bowl win Sunday night.

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:

The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

Lyrics:

You got the nerve to come and say
That you’re not standing in my way
When we both know
That you’re not who you say you are
And you’re a mess
And you know it
Even thought you try real hard still show it
Still show it

You can’t take it back
With all I tried
All I know’s that
You can’t shape me

I’ve been up and I’ve been down
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero
Well I’ve had high hopes up till now
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero

Are we ok, we alright?
Heard you’ve been having sleepless nights
Now I know that
We can’t go back
Back to how things use to be

Seasons still change
But you’ll still be the same

You can’t take it back
With all I tried
All I know’s that
You can’t shape me

I’ve been up and I’ve been down
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero
Well I’ve had high hopes up till now
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero

Seasons still change
But you’ll still be the same
You’ll be the same

You can’t take it back
Will all I tried
And I know that
You can’t shape me

I’ve been up and I’ve been down
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero
Well I’ve had high hopes up till now
And now I’ve realised
You’ll never be my hero
You’ll never be my hero

(Never be my hero)

You’ll never be my hero

Paul Schrader’s newest film, about a middle-aged pastor named Toller (Ethan Hawke, in a truly extraordinary performance) who is shocked out of his self-inflicted torment when he is called to minister to a troubled young environmental activist and his wife (Philip Ettinger and Amanda Seyfried), is as deeply personal as it is politically and spiritually urgent. The film also stars Cedric the Entertainer as the leader of the megachurch that oversees Toller’s 250-year-old landmarked structure and his ever-dwindling congregation. Schrader has created a potent cinematic experience, a carefully constructed, beautifully crafted communion with one lonely soul that allows us to gaze right into the eye of modern media- and money-fueled horror. An NYFF55 selection. An A24 release.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center is devoted to supporting the art and elevating the craft of cinema. The only branch of the world-renowned arts complex Lincoln Center to shine a light on the everlasting yet evolving importance of the moving image, this nonprofit organization was founded in 1969 to celebrate American and international film. Via year-round programming and discussions; its annual New York Film Festival; and its publications, including Film Comment, the U.S.’s premier magazine about films and film culture, the Film Society endeavors to make the discussion and appreciation of cinema accessible to a broader audience, as well as to ensure that it will remain an essential art form for years to come.

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. 

While her song ""Devil Devil"" hit success, it wasn't until her anthem ""Quiet"" made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. 

With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0PMbl7wzhY0/sddefault.jpg,0.013148274366441538,0.00030980853832331617,42.44,0.0004709089782514406,0.013458082904764856,0.013928991883016295,2018-01-19,05:03:42,Friday,4,6,27,6,27,36,189,3,35,1,1,4,10,0,6,5.0,6.0,"['RIOT Ti', '', 'Ic', 'OAD INU', '', 'THIS,']","['RIOT', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'OAD', 'INU', 'THIS,']",True,"['riot', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'oad', 'inu', 'thi', ',']",7,7,18,1,0,2,0,6.2043957208298295,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

The way you hear is based on everything from the shape of your ears to the frequencies you are best tuned into. In this video I explain some of the factors that affect the way you hear the way you do. That is the primary focus of this video but to demonstrate how manipulated frequencies help you hear differently, we'll change the way you hear the Yanny/Laurel soundbyte.

In February 2015 a viral picture of a dress spawned a debate online - is the dress black and blue or white and gold? Depending on how you see and process the picture, you will likely feel strongly one way or another.

In May 2018 a short audio sample of a robotic voice saying one name circulated the internet yet again putting people's personally processing against others. This time, as with the dress debate, people would hear one or the other and not understand how anyone could hear anything different.

In this video we'll go digging into the sound wave and by the end, you'll likely be able to hear both. Hint: It's all about the frequencies you're dialed in on. For the raw sound byte, you may hear a man with a low-medium voice say ""Laurel"" or you'll hear a high pitched computerized voice say ""Yanny"".

Do you know how to create the atmosphere of a good movie? First you need a talented director, a cameraman and a scriptwriter, and some great actors to do their best. But then what? It turns out that the production of the film doesn't end here, because it has to go through the sound department first. Not only to dub the voices of the protagonists when necessary, but to give sound to the objects. After all, microphones that record the speech of actors cannot record, for example, the sounds of a busy street or the sound of horse hooves, otherwise it would be a terrible disaster. That's why sound recording experts, also known as Foley artists, come to the aid of the film industry and do their magic. Theses are the tools of these guys: a device to watch the film already shot, a good microphone and their imagination. So, in today's video, we'll show you the incredible way sound effects are made in movies",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RjzUbLpaKw/sddefault.jpg,0.0091191119246175,0.0008604394498935911,10.598202959830868,0.0005195380695340584,0.009979551374511092,0.01049908944404515,2018-04-04,18:01:46,Wednesday,2,8,48,8,39,40,334,0,62,0,0,8,2,4,9,4.0,6.0,"['a', 'ANS Hs']","['a', 'ANS', 'Hs']",True,"['a', 'an', 'Hs']",3,3,5,0,0,1,2,6.4135791025654285,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'toothbrush': 1, 'person': 1}",2

This is the latest and maybe not so greatest rendition of KITT (Knight Industries THREE thousand) from the 2008 reboot of the classic 80s action series KNIGHT RIDER. 
This screen used mustang is owned by Richard Morey. It is a 2008 Mustang GT... wait.. no, it's a super snake... no that's not right. It's a King of the Road edition.... wait it's really quiet isn't it? For a V8? Oh SHIT! It's a V6... the movie industry strikes again! 
This awesome looking mustang is actually a V6 dubbed over to sound and look like a V8. 

This is the story behind the remaining mustang from Knight Rider in 2008. There was another car that left the studios hands and it surprisingly went to Vaughn Gittin Jr. as his old drift car when he started out with Ford.

Mary Pat Linnen asked her: Isn't it time for some members to return to private service and to encourage younger folks run for office.' Pelosi first replied: 'Should I take that personally?' and then went on to say she ran for office after raising her five children. ‘I don't think age has that much to do with it,’ she said. Meanwhile, critics have attacked Pelosi over appearing to stumble over her words as accused Republicans of wanting to slash education budgets.

LETRA:

Quem diria que fosse chegar nesse ponto
Me fala eu tô pronto
Tô querendo saber
É melhor pra você

Não precisa me preservar
Não vou me assustar
Prometeu que ia se conter
Eu falei que pagava pra ver

Mentiu pra amigas
Falou que não ia dançar
Mas a sua promessa
O grave bateu pra quebrar

E quando ela escuta o grave
Ela desce suave
Desce suave
Toda sem maldade
Ela desce suave
Tem habilidade
Ela desce suave
Desce suave
Que maravilha
É só bunda pra baixo
Bunda pra cima
Olha essa menina
Toda empinadinha
É só bunda pra baixo
Bunda pra cima

Ela joga na cara
Joga na cara
Joga na cara
E já tá preparada
Ela joga na cara
Toda abusada
E na arte da dança
Ela já é treinada

E quando viu 
Já tava rebolando
As mãozinhas pra cima jogando
E o ritmo te controlando

Descendo, causando
Remexendo, rebolando

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Harry Potter movie series was filmed over ten years, so we can imagine that a lot of things changed during this time. Characters like Voldemort, Lavender Brown, Albus Dumbledore, Griphook, Helena Ravenclaw, The Fat Lady, Bill Weasley, Tom, Harry Potter, and Vincent Crabbe don’t look the same anymore. This is why we are showing you 10 Harry Potter Actors Who Were Replaced in the Sequels. We all know that Harry Potter is portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe. But many other people played his role when he was a little baby. Some people say that baby Harry in the first movie is actually Albus Severus Potter in the last film. And you’ll find out if this theory is true or not by watching this video.
When she was a minor character, Lavender Brown used to be played by black child actor Jennifer Smith. However, when she became more important, the filmmakers had to find an actress who had more experience than her. And even though Jessie Cave did a great job, she was a little too white compared to the other actress.
Stay tuned if you want to hear more about Harry Potter actors that were replaced in the sequels like people who portrayed Voldemort, Lavender Brown, Albus Dumbledore, Griphook, Helena Ravenclaw, The Fat Lady, Bill Weasley, Tom, Harry Potter, and Vincent Crabbe. Do you agree with the choices that the casting directors made? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think.

10. Great White Shark
If you’ve been on a boat out on the ocean, a Jaws attack has probably crossed your mind. Even if it’s just barely!! Then of course you rationalize that the chances of that happening are practically 0. Practically. That’s what Terry Selwood, a 73-year-old Australian fisherman learned in 2017, when a great white shark leapt out of the water, into his boat!!

9. An Eagle Ray
Rays seem like beautiful, serene creatures - but they can be extremely dangerous, even if you’re on the relative safety of a large tourist boat. In 2011, Jenny Hausch had rented a 26-foot catamaran for her family to take a trip in Florida. Sounds really nice right?

8. Swordfish
In 2017, Alan Pope, a British tourist, was on a boat trip getting ready to go snorkeling in Indonesia when everything went horribly wrong. Without any warning, a swordfish jumped out of the water and into the boat, and impaled his neck with its bill. The end snapped off, and left six inches of the sword still jabbed inside his neck, just millimeters from instantly killing him.

7. Sperm Whales
The Gulf of Alaska is a prime fishing location, especially for those trying to catch black cod. In these waters, though, there is a much larger creature that also likes eating the fish- sperm whales. They are the ocean’s largest toothed predators, and while they are quite capable of catching food for themselves, they much prefer taking the easy route.

6. Giant Squid
Mostly creatures of legend, giant squids are mentioned in many old mariners tales of dangers at sea. But they are rarely seen, let alone involved in attacking boats. So when a team of French sailors came face to face with one  in 2003, they almost didn’t believe it!!

5. Bull Shark
You might think that a great white shark would be the  most problematic shark species to boats, but there’s another type that can be more aggressive, and more likely to risk an encounter.

4. Jellyfish
Sometimes it’s the smallest things that can have the biggest effect, something that became ever so apparent in 2017 when Chinese scientists were investigating why their aircraft carriers were experiencing difficulties. They found that large swarms of Jellyfish were getting caught up in the propulsion systems! This would stop the ships dead in their tracks, or cause the engines to overheat and cause extreme damage.

3. Mako Shark
This next story took place just last year, 2017 in Long Island, New York. A fishing charter boat was taking guests to the location where they find the widest variety of fish, when suddenly a Mako shark jumped onto the side of the boat. Unfortunately for the fish, it managed to get itself stuck in the handrail of the boat and, despite thrashing about, it couldn’t free itself.

2. Black Marlin
Game fishing is a popular pastime for many enthusiasts, but when you’re chasing after some of the largest and most powerful marine creatures on earth, you have to be ready for the unpredictable. Again last year, things went very wrong indeed for a fishing boat off the coast of Panama. They had caught a black marlin, a species that can weight up to 1500 pounds and reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour.

1. Killer Whale
If you’ve ever watched a nature documentary that’s featured Killer Whales, you’ll be all too familiar how organised and clever they can be. Pods work together to catch prey, and even tilt ice flows to trap seals. When they turn these skills towards human activity, the results can be frightening.

[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong, it's pretty cool to be on T.V
So all the folks back home can see me
And that I'm livin' it out
All the things I used to dream about
Yeah, it's pretty great, the playin' on a stage
Proud 'cause there ain't an empty seat in the place
But, girl, ever since I met you
I got a whole new perspective

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I hope the first question people ask me
Is ""How's your girl and how's your family?""
I could go on and on and on
Talkin' 'bout you for days
You can bet when I hear, ""Congratulations""
Want it to be because we made it
Another five years
Best thing I got is right here

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Ooh, famous for lovin' you
Ooh

[Outro]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
And if I'm gonna go down in history
I hope it's all 'cause of you and me
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you

Why do the phone batteries decrease so quickly? We have 15 amazing tips that will make your smartphone live a longer life! 

Nowadays one can hardly imagine life without a cell phone. And it happens quite often that our gadgets start to act up just half a year after we bought them. It is frustrating, but in most cases, we ourselves are to blame! Let’s face it — we don’t always handle our devices properly.

SUMMARY
- To increase your gadget’s battery life, you should recharge it more often. The best option is to do it each time the battery power indicator drops to 10-20%. This will increase the number of discharge cycles up to 1000-1100 cycles. 
- An inbuilt controller stops the battery from taking more current than necessary, so there is absolutely no risk of overcharging the battery and destroying it. 
- There have been situations when a person was using a non-native charger, and it caused a fire in the house! And another terrible thing that can happen if you use non-native chargers and cables is getting an electric shock. 
- We recommend you to avoid using chargers that claim to charge your battery fully in less than an hour. 
- If your smartphone has a bulky protective case, it might cause the device and its battery to overheat during a lengthy recharging session. 
- It is recommended to discharge your phone’s battery every three months to 0% and then immediately charge it to 100% to get rid of the extremes of full charge/discharge. 
- A high temperature is the worst thing you can imagine for lithium-ion batteries: they totally can’t stand overheating. 
- Carry the phone in an inner pocket of your coat or an outer pocket but encased in a protective covering. Low temperatures are harmful to the battery because it needs more power to keep itself warm enough to function. 
- Try to lower the brightness of your screen at least by 30-40%. 
- At the approach of a thunderstorm, never charge your phone. Actually, the same goes for all the electrical appliances you have. 
- To wipe the screen, use lint-free wipers and whatever you do, never use window cleaning liquids. They contain ammonia which can damage the screen irrevocably. 
- If you drop your cell phone into a pool or a sink, the first thing you should do after you get it out is turn it off and remove the battery (if it’s possible, of course). 
- Don’t put your cell phone on the dashboard when driving. Constant moving and bumping can cause a lot of damage. 
- Read user reviews before you hit the update button. The problem with such updates is that it’s either very hard or impossible to go back to the previous version of the software. 
- Even if you have a lot of free space on your hard drive, it’s better to use cloud storage anyway. This way your phone won’t be clogged with too much data so that it will perform much better.

Lyrics:
why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

i find it so strange
after all these years
i’m still more or less the same

wherever i go
whatever i do
 whatever i know
it just comes and goes so soon

whatever life brings
whatever song it seems
i’m still whistling the same old tune

why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

i find it so strange
after all these years
i’m still more or less the same

whoever i’m with
whatever i take
whatever i give
i’m still running in the same old race

whatever choice i make
whatever road i take
i still wind up in the same old place

so why
why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

oh i
i find it so strange
after all these years
i’m still more or less the same

i’m more or less the same
i’m more or less the same

Wanda Sykes came out and revealed that Netflix offered her lower than $250,000. Wanda is the first comic to stand in solidarity with Mo'Nique. So does this mean that Mo'Nique was Right all along?

THE FREE BIKE CHALLENGE - PART 4 is here and what a banger it is, I managed to land a big move on this old school mtb and I was pumped!

If your new to this mini series then start below:
EP1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlyx2S2MBBU

In this episode we hit the streets of my hometown, colchester. After a bit of street riding and a bit of mechanical issues we hit up halfords to get some new parts then head to the skatepark for the final session of the day!

I still can't believe how long this bike has lasted and how well such an old bike is performing, its crazy!! 

I hope you guys are enjoying this mini series, let me know what you want to see next!!!

ENJOY!

WATCH OUR INTERVIEW W/ PARADE MAGAZINE! ►► http://bit.ly/2Aql2BC

Ever wondered what REALLY happens at a Korean day spa? We took Beauty Trippin all the way to Koreatown in Los Angeles to experience a Korea-style bath house (also known as a “jjimjilbang”) at the Hugh Wellness Spa!!

Erin & Joslyn try out all the different themed rooms – including a steam sauna, Himalayan salt room, charcoal mud clay room, ice room, and oxygen room! – before ending with a traditional Korean BODY SCRUB. Oooof…bye bye literally every dead skin cell on our bodies!

Okay, so the ""stripping down and getting your skin rubbed off by strangers"" part is a little scary, but otherwise this was probably one of the BEST spa treatments we’ve gotten! Detoxifying, therapeutic, and SOOOO relaxing… 

Have you ever visited a Korean Spa or jjimjilbang? What crazy beauty, spa, or self-care treatment should we try NEXT?? Talk to us in the comments!

A zen like place where you don’t know all the answers and you don’t have to! You trust and enjoy the ride.

This practice invites you to drop all preconceptions and open yourself up to all of YOUR possibilities.

The ones that have existed since the day you were born.

This month I am taking time to nurture my spirit of enquiry. I invite you to do the same!

With beginner's mind practice, we will be lighter, creative and open to more possibilities.

ほろりと来るシーン盛り沢山。
この動画の最後、歴代の王との戦闘から後は、既存のものと同じになります。

会話シーンをどうするか悩んだんですが、仲間とイリス、シドニーは気になる人も多いと思うので、入れておきました。

シドニーの電話はサブクエクリア後に掛かって来ます。
ケルベロス戦のコルは、サブクエをクリアしてないと出て来ません。

「神凪は死してもその使命から開放されることはない」
「遅くなったけど、強くなった」
その意味が何となく分かる内容になっているように思います。

しかし、主要キャラがみんな美形過ぎて、王の剣のモブ顔が気になります(笑)

Advertising Age media reporter Jeanine Poggi joins ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss some of this year's star-studded ads and why most brands are steering clear of politics.

Leaning on its deep neural networks, and general reinforcement learning algorithm, DeepMind's AI Alpha Zero learned to play chess well beyond the skill level of master, besting the 2016 top chess engine Stockfish 8 in a 100-game match. Alpha Zero had 28 wins, 72 draws, and 0 losses. Impressive right? And it took just 4 hours of self-play to reach such a proficiency. What the chess world has witnessed from this historic event is, simply put, mind-blowing! AlphaZero vs Magnus Carlsen anyone? :)

I'm a self-taught National Master in chess out of Pennsylvania, USA who was introduced to the game by my father in 1988 at the age of 8. The purpose of this channel is to share my knowledge of chess to help others improve their game. I enjoy continuing to improve my understanding of this great game, albeit slowly.

4-time National Champion, 3 Guinness World Records, Amazing Race Season 28, throws frisbees into trash cans, basketball hoops, and pretty much anything a frisbee will fit in to. Always down to try new things and ideas, so please let me know what vids you want to see. More family-friendly content coming your way!

FOR this conservationist, there is only one way to start her day - by hanging out with leopards.  Babette De Jonge, 50, founded Wild Cats World in 2010 to help conserve endangered big cats, such as leopards, black-footed cats and African wildcats. Based in Kirkwood, South Africa, the sanctuary, started in 2012, is home to four leopards, and one cub, cheetahs, servals, caracals and Africa’s smallest cat - the black-footed cat. By building up a mutual respect with the leopards - who were rescued from exploitation - Babette has been able to work hands on with them during their rehabilitation.

In this video:

Unless you’ve managed to make it this far in life without setting foot in a store, you’re probably aware that jello,  popularly known as jelly by my British compatriots, is a genericization of the brand Jell-O which itself was derived from the word “gelatin”. (See: The Jiggly History of Jell-O) Gelatin is a protein derived from collagen via a process called hydrolysis, which breaks apart the bonds of this protein with water.

Lyrics: 
We tore our phones to shreds
We didn't answer nothing
To all friends and family:
Lost or dead.
I couldn't get much sleep
You lost your self in mine.
It couldn't get much worse
Than the best time of life.

There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you.
I'm sweating out potential
But I'm nervous at my central for you.
There's nothing in my system
So I'm feeling what I feel for you.
There's nothing left to miss
Except the shots I take
And phone calls from you
Now I just need you to feel it too.

Our residence is in this bed.
All I want's The Office
And what's awful is—
""Don't think like that.""
You couldn't get much sleep
I found you just in time
But hey
For what it's worth
I think you saved my life.

I think I'll die obsessed
Let's give up fighting back.
You don't need to grip the best
Because we're lucky people
And you'll never have to sleep alone.

It's been over 5 years since the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. Looking at Sandy Hook five years later, we see how what happened at sandy hook in Newtown, CT, affected so many lives and the discourse in our country. The Sandy Hook shooting, that december 14 2012 school shooting, was an unimaginable tragedy. Advocates have called for more gun safety and gun violence prevention in the years since. Moms Demand Action and Everytown for gun safety have been leading the way to stop mass shootings and more deaths.

We put down the top when we're drivin'
Don't take off your top while I'm drivin'
Might give you some top while you're drivin'
But no I'm not tryna drive in
Your imagination is wilin' 
Though I'm hesitatin' to dive in
To your nether regions and thigh-land
An invitation I'm declinin'
Sirens
Blarin'
Flashin' in the back
Barin'
This skin
Better watch your back
Starin'
But can we pump on the breaks
I still want to want you after the day breaks

I'm not tryna Go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car

It won't pop off on this drop off,
I aint droppin' out of this ride
If you keep turnin' with cheeks burnin' 
I'm u-turnin' these tires
I could stop off and let you hop off
If you keep offerin' rides
If I talk tough it's cuz I been bluffin'
And I wanna come inside

And we were sittin' by the curb side
I couldn't really get the words right
Feels like I'm watchin' from the bird's eye view
When you turned away with curved eyes, you
Start to lean back when I lean in
Then turn your lean back with a mean grin
I spin the keys in the ignition
But then still wait for you to walk in

I'm not tryna go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car

You start to lean back when I lean in
You want it all or you want nothin
You start to lean back when I lean in
You want it all or you want nothin'

Only leanin' in for a kiss
Hope it doesn't seem like a diss
Only leanin' in for a kiss
Hope it doesn't seem like a diss

The overalls I mentioned were the Carhartt R28 carpenter overalls with a strong built in tool pouch that seems to be popular in the USA with plumbers, sprinkler fitters, elevator mechanics and other trades that use loose hardware.
Paul of Brix Workwear in Ireland generously arranged a set of the standard R01 bib overalls as a gift, so that technically makes him the current official workwear sponsor of bigclivedotcom.  He didn't ask for a link, but here's a link to his website:-
http://www.brixworkwear.com
The brass stopcocks (if they are actually brass) are a common item usually sold in 15mm and 22mm pipe sizes (plus some bigger ones.)  When you see the amount of machining in them it makes the price remarkable and suggests major mass production in a competitive market.
A bit of research suggests that the graphite may have been a graphite packing washer optimised for high temperature applications.  I've never seen it used in an application like this before.
Note that the adjustable spanner was not up to AvE's standards.
The compression glands are supposed to be tightened until they grip and then a percentage more to fully compress the olive onto the pipe.  Personally I overdo it out of mild paranoia of pipes popping out of fitments.

Some scientists believe in vitro, or cell-cultivated, meat is a sustainable and animal-friendly solution. But, before deciding if we are willing to eat meat from the lab, we need to explore the food culture it brings us.

Dr. Koert van Mensvoort takes the stage to explain exactly what in vitro meat is, alongside an entertaining exploration into its creative potential - including Dodo nuggets and meat ice cream. 
"" ""Dr. Koert van Mensvoort is an artist and philosopher best known for his work on the philosophical concept of Next Nature, which revolves around the idea that our technological environment has become so complex, omnipresent and autonomous that it is best perceived as a nature of its own. 

It is his aim to better understand our co-evolutionary relationship with technology and help set out a track towards a future that is rewarding for both humankind and the planet at large.

From White Roses to white hot looks, this year’s Grammy Awards was a feast of fashion, thanks to so many celebs bringing their A-game to the show. So let’s kick off this list of the best dressed from the red carpet, starting with Lady Gaga.

Gaga looked like a gothic princess in her dramatic all-black ball gown. The Armani Privé dress featured a lacy bodysuit and billowing black skirt with a HUGE train. Gaga’s black heeled boots were also some of the highest we’ve ever seen, like, ever. But we wouldn’t expect anything less from Mother Monster.

Another look we loved from the carpet was Anna Kendrick’s sexy suit by Balmain. Anna gave the structured look a sexy, feminine touch by wearing a lacy, strapless top underneath and some pale pink stilettos. Her suit may have said “business”, but her relaxed, wavy hairstyle said “I came to get down.”

Next on our list is the literally RED HOT Camila Cabello. Camila was all glitz and glam in her strapless Vivienne Westwood gown that hugged her curves perfectly. Camila opted to wear her hair up and accessorized with some serious bling, but it’s that plunging neckline that has us unable to look away.

Another look we loved came courtesy of Miley Cyrus, who absolutely SLAYED in her black velvet bodysuit. Miley looked beyond chic from her classic Hollywood hairstyle to her glittery heels.

Speaking of shoes that stand out, Hailee Steinfeld had our jaws dropping with her metallic purple knee-high boots. Talk about a statement piece! Hailee stunned in her strapless white dress that featured a thigh-high slit to show off those boots that were made for watching.

Another celeb we couldn’t take our eyes off was Cardi B. Cardi looked like an actual ANGEL on the red carpet in her statement dress by designer Mohammed Ashi. The look was theatrical and fun, while still remaining elegant and feminine, and we’re straight-up obsessed. Especially because Cardi admitted that she had butterflies in both her QUOTE, “stomach and vagina” while looking like a perfect angel.

Another star who looked iconic at the show was Rita Ora. Rita looked completely classic in her velvet, one shoulder black and silver gown. It wasn’t the edgiest look of the night by any means, but what can we say--we’re straight-up suckers for that old Hollywood glam. And any woman with legs that toned should always opt to show them off!

Next up, Bebe Rexha was all about showing off her enviable curves in her light-pink, figure-hugging gown. Bebe revealed that the glittery dress was originally designed for actress Sofia Vergara, but that she told her stylist QUOTE, “You better get that dress for me!!'” We are so glad Bebe managed to snag it because D-A-M-N, girl!

You know we can’t have a Best Dressed list without including our girl Rihanna, and once again our favorite fashion icon did not disappoint. Riri wore an all-leather burgundy ensemble that featured a trench-coat AND gloves. It gave us Carmen San Diego meets The Matrix vibes, and honestly Rihanna is probably the only person on the planet who could’ve pulled it off. Although Riri skipped the red carpet this year, she showed off her Grammy look while accepting the award for best rap collaboration alongside Kendrick Lamar.

Of course it wasn’t JUST the ladies who rocked the red carpet, some of the gentlemen also brought their fashion A-game to the show. We wanna give honorable mentions to Nick Jonas, Common, and host James Corden, but the guy who really stole our attention tonight for a spot on our 10 best dressed list was Zayn. Zayn stood out in a perfectly tailored light pink suit. He gave the outfit a cheeky pop of color with his socks, but our favorite part of the look was that his white rose was actually stitched onto his lapel. The entire ensemble was smart, sophisticated, and unique--without being totally out there. So A+ to Zayn and all of the other best dressed celebs on this list.

Alright guys now I wanna know which celeb’s ensemble from this year’s Grammy awards was your fave? Let me know in the comments below, and after that click over here to check out Kendrick Lamar’s epic opening performance from the show.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0qXuuM_39O4/sddefault.jpg,0.02332895132660296,0.0001955992476023861,119.26912609615968,0.00047773060867386564,0.023524550574205338,0.0240022811828792,2018-06-06,05:26:40,Wednesday,2,8,37,8,32,54,321,1,76,0,1,6,16,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.249111500681941,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Important Things Down Here ⤵

I’ve been playing electric guitar for over 10 years now, but recently I decided to get a bass guitar and play for the first time!

Youtube was recommending me videos from Tosin Abasi, and his finger picking technique inspired me.

I know it might sound strange to be inspired to play bass because of a guitar player, but the “double thump” technique (at least from what I know) was pioneered by Victor Wooten.

Regardless, I’m really excited to learn how to play the bass guitar!

If there’s any useful advice or any other instruments you’d like to see me play, leave a comment letting me know ^-^

I finally got to film a video with the queen of HI EVERYONE! Lilly Ghalichi Mir herself!!! I actually get quite a few amount of questions in videos about lashes and questions about how to put them on, measure them, cut them, clean them, care for them, lick them, etc. I may not know a lot about lashes but make sure youre not licking them. So i decided to ask one of my good friends, ex boss and overall favorite boss lady Lilly to come onto my channel so we can talk all about lashes. I know there are A LOT of other amazing lash companies out there and i have used them on my socials from time to time. In this video i wanted to showcase my absolute favorite simply because Lilly and Lilly Lashes have been such a huge help in getting me to where i am today as a social media influencer. For those of you who dont know, my first job when moving to Los Angeles was at Lilly Lashes. Lilly took a shot by hiring me and i am forever grateful for that because i was able to move to LA, have a job that i loved, meet amazing people in my industry, had an amazing business woman to help me understand business and marketing in the digital space and had someone who really helped push me in pursuing my dreams. Lilly will forever hold a huge place in my heart and i will always support her as she did me. Ok enough with all the mushy emotional stuff. I truly hope yall enjoy this video and got to learn something or you were entertained by us. Either way, let me know down below if yall want to see Lilly again on my channel and what other kind of videos we should do.

LOVE,
Gabriel 💙

I Fall Apart – Post Malone Lyrics:

[Intro]
Oooh, I fall apart
Oooh, yeah, mmhmm

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough, yeah
And she left me with a broken heart, yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault, yeah
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain, yeah
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me, so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a wh*re
Devil in the form of a wh*re
You said it
No, you said it
No, you said it
We'd be together

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it’s a little more complicated: he’s yet to tell his family or friends he’s gay and he doesn’t actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing. Directed by Greg Berlanti (Dawson’s Creek, Brothers & Sisters), written by Isaac Aptaker & Elizabeth Berger (This is Us), and based on Becky Albertalli’s acclaimed novel, LOVE, SIMON is a funny and heartfelt coming-of-age story about the thrilling ride of finding yourself and falling in love.

Cast: Nick Robinson, Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg, Miles Heizer, Keiynan Lonsdale, Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, Tony Hale.

Directed by: Greg Berlanti

Screenplay by: Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger

Produced by: Wyck Godfrey and Marty Bowen

Even the healthiest diet can result in severe health problems if your pots and pans are toxic. Find out which cookware you should avoid by all means for the sake of your own health and the health of your family.
The non-stick properties of Teflon cookware are achieved with a coating of PTFE. This is a plastic polymer that, when heated above 572°F, starts to release toxins. These toxic fumes lead to flu-like symptoms called polymer fume fever, informally known as Teflon flu. Another chemical compound found in Teflon cookware is especially threatening since it tends to stay in the body (as well as in the environment) for long periods of time. Try cast-iron cookware instead. It even comes in non-stick varieties. It doesn't leak anything toxic into your food and is actually a nice natural way to increase your body’s iron levels.
Though aluminum cookware is usually coated, the coating is prone to chipping, allowing the toxic metal to get right into your food. As for aluminum foil, using it while cooking is even more dangerous. In fact, there’s an established safe amount of aluminum the human body can manage daily, and that’s 20 mg per pound of body weight a day. When you wrap your food in aluminum foil and cook it this way, the amount of this substance that leaks into the food significantly exceeds the permissible level. Consider using glass cookware instead.
If you’ve just enjoyed some fish in lemon juice or stewed tomatoes cooked in an uncoated copper pot and you find yourself suffering from extremely unpleasant symptoms (such as vomiting blood, light-headedness, yellowy skin, or gastrointestinal distress, among others) call 911 immediately.  Try this safe alternative instead: stainless steel. Just make sure you're buying food-grade stainless steel since this is the only type that doesn't contain any nickel or chromium.
Soft ceramic coating isn't durable enough and starts chipping after a few months of daily use. When this happens, lead and cadmium sometimes found in the coating will end up in your food and, thus, in your body. Lead poisoning is one of the most dangerous types of metal poisoning and can result in abdominal pain, headaches, infertility, and other health complications. Try this safe alternative instead: 100% ceramic cookware.

TIMESTAMPS
Teflon cookware 0:38
Aluminum cookware and aluminum foil 3:31
Copper cookware 5:12
Ceramic-coated cookware 6:54

SUMMARY
-Teflon contains plastic polymer that, when heated above 572°F, starts to release toxins. Try this safe alternative instead: real cast-iron. This is a nontoxic cooking option that truly withstands the test of time. It heats well and evenly throughout.
-Aluminum is a neurotoxic metal. Elevated levels of aluminum in the body have been linked to several central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer's and ALS. Try this safe alternative instead: glass cookware. It’ll never release anything toxic when heated, it doesn’t hold onto any old flavors or odors, and it's not only durable but also eco-friendly.
-Copper cookware, especially when it isn’t coated, can easily send you to the ER with a bad case of metal poisoning. And that’s because it can release copper when you cook acidic foods. Stainless steel is a great cookware option: it's relatively lightweight, scratch-resistant, and comes in non-stick varieties.
-Soft ceramic coating isn't durable enough and starts chipping after a few months of daily use. When this happens, lead and cadmium sometimes found in the coating will end up in your food and, thus, in your body. Try this safe alternative instead: 100% ceramic cookware. This is one of the best and safest options out there since it's made with completely natural materials, it isn't toxic, and it won't chip or peel off.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again! 

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi! 

Big hugs, 

Louise xxx

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

Screenplay by: Justin Haythe
Based upon the book by: Jason Matthews

[SOUND DOCTRINE]의 리드 싱글
공간을 비워낸 ‘기억의 빈자리’

2012년 ‘바람기억’과 2015년 ‘같은 시간 속의 너’는 광풍이었다. 그리고 가장 눈길을 끌었던 부분은 독보적인 차트 장기체류를 만들어 내었다는 점이다. 수많은 대중이 나얼의 노래를 통해 감동받고 싶어 했고, 듣고 또 듣고 나서도 다시 플레이리스트에 나얼의 곡을 올렸다. 빠르고 가벼운 가요계의 현실을 비웃듯 묵직한 감동을 선사하며 나얼의 노래들은 그렇게 그 해 최고의 히트곡들로 자리했다.

2017년 광풍이 다시 몰아칠 예정이다. 나얼의 두 번째 솔로 정규 앨범 [SOUND DOCTRINE]이 발매를 앞두고 있기 때문이다. 앨범 제목이 주는 강렬함만큼 압도적인 앨범이 되리라 쉽게 예상할 수 있다. 그에게만 주어진 노래 실력, 그리고 세세한 부분까지 직접 체크하는 신중함은 대중에게 외면받기가 오히려 쉽지 않다.

새 솔로 앨범에 대한 수많은 팬들의 기대와 궁금증은 앨범 발매에 앞서 싱글 커트된 ‘기억의 빈자리’를 통해 어느 정도 해소되리라 보인다. 단지 한 곡에 불과하지만 리드 싱글이 가진 상징성을 생각하면 나얼이 새 앨범 작업에 어떤 태도로 임했는지 조금이나마 짐작할 수 있기 때문이다. 늘 그래왔듯 이번 싱글 역시 작곡, 작사뿐만 아니라 아트웍까지 본인이 만들어내었다.

‘기억의 빈자리’는 이전 히트곡인 ‘바람기억’과 ‘같은 시간 속의 너’를 연상시키는 감성 발라드 곡이지만 이전 곡들에 비해 사운드의 시간을 더 뒤로 돌렸다는 점이 두드러진다. 의도적으로 신디사이저의 베이직 사운드들을 활용하면서 1980년대 신스 팝발라드의 따뜻한 감성을 만들어 냈다.

곡의 가장 큰 특징은 사운드를 비워냈다는 점이다. 가창이 담긴 오리지널 버전과 피아노 버전 모두 악기 편성을 최소화했다. 두텁게 사운드를 쌓아 올려 소리의 공간을 채우는 현재의 트렌드와는 분명 다른 길이다. 웃기도록 놀라운 점은 저 심심한 사운드 위에 얹은 나얼의 목소리가 더 강렬하게 공간을 뚫고 나온다는 것. 밀도가 낮은 소리의 공간을 오르내리며 나얼의 목소리는 여전히 강렬한 감동을 선사한다. 담백하고 차분하게 이야기를 풀어내고 점점 고조되는 격정을 해소한 뒤 역시 차분하게 마무리된다. 첫 싱글이 대중의 기대에서 빗겨나지 않았다는 점에서 팬들은 감동과 안도감을 동시에 선물 받을 것이다.

브라운아이드소울 때도, 솔로 1집 때도 그러했듯 이번에도 나얼은 특별한 매체에 곡을 담았다. 8cm 싱글 CD를 선택하고 오리지널 버전, 피아노 버전, 연주곡 버전 세 곡을 담아 한정 발매한다. 디지털 싱글이 주요 매체가 되어버리면서 사라진 싱글의 의미를 다시 생각하게 만드는 대목이다. 싱글 음반을 구매하는 이들에게 어필할 수 있는 싱글용 편곡 버전이 함께 담기고, 연주곡까지 함께 담겨 있는 모습이 반갑다. 나얼은 이렇게 설명한다. ‘디지털 싱글이라는 인식이 강해서 싱글 음반이 가진 개념이 많이 혼란스러워졌어요. 싱글은 소비하고 사라지는 일회용 음악이 아닌 오히려 곡에 대한 다양한 것들을 보여주기 위한 시도였거든요. 한 곡 한 곡 깊게 더 고민하고 다양한 사운드를 들려주는 것이 싱글의 목적이었어요. 디지털 시대 이전부터 많은 뮤지션들이 음악을 발매했던 그런 방식...’

나얼은 어쩌면 과거에 집착한다. 매체의 변화를 좇지 않으며, 현재의 사운드에 기대지 않는다. 그럼에도 불구하고 트렌드를 집어 삼키는 반전의 결과... 과거의 매체, 과거의 사운드 안에서 우리는 더 많은 것들을 느끼고 감동할 수 있었다는 점을 수년에 한 번씩 나얼을 통해 되새기게 된다. (글/대중음악 평론가 이용지)

Among the clips, several show animal rescues. Earlier in the week, people rallied to save a horse that fell into a crevice while attempting to escape the fires, who is now expected to make a full recovery thanks to human intervention. And as the fires spread across Highway 1 in Ventura County, video of a rabbit darting across lanes of traffic and into a burning bush captured the moment when a man went in for a daring animal rescue. With smoke and flames all around, the man attempts to first locate the rabbit, but the search proves difficult, and leads to frustration, after which, shouting dramatically and wading into the brush, the man flushes out the rabbit, scoops him up, and clutches him to his body as the video ends.

After purchasing the iPhone, there have been many features that I found missing on the X which made me enjoy using the 8 Plus even more. In this video I share with you what those features are. The intentions of this video is to share my experience and knowledge with you on using both of these phones with the intentions of helping you decide which is going to be your next phone. With that being said, earlier this year I created a full in depth comparison between the two phones which you can check out below!

Lyrics:
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have some snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But,  we discuss the importance of sleep for the entire family and how we got Sonny to sleep 12 hours a night! I need to put the disclaimer in that every baby is obviously different and will react to methods differently. However, we lay out the plan that Alanna McGinn with @GNSLEEPSITE helped us craft to make sleep successful for Sonny, so there's no harm in trying some of the things we tried!! There are so many different opinions about when to sleep train, how to sleep train or if sleep training is even the right route for them so I am curious to know how you have approached it- both what worked or didn't work so we can help all these sleepless mamas and papas out!

SDR PHY for OsmocomBB

Since SDR (Software Defined Radio) becomes more popular and more available for everyone, there is a lot of projects based on this technology. Looking from the mobile telecommunications side, at the moment it's possible to run your own GSM or UMTS network using a transmit capable SDR device and free software like OsmoBTS or OpenBTS. There is also the srsLTE project, which provides open source implementation of LTE base station (eNodeB) and moreover the client side stack (srsUE) for SDR. Our talk is about the R&D process of porting the existing GSM mobile side stack (OsmocomBB) to the SDR based hardware, and about the results we have achieved.

There is a great open source mobile side GSM protocol stack implementation - OsmocomBB project. One could be used for different purposes, including education and research. The problem is that the SDR platforms were out of the hardware the project could work on. The primary supported hardware for now are old Calypso based phones (mostly Motorola C1XX).

Despite they are designed to act as mobile phone, there are still some limitations, such as the usage of proprietary firmware for DSP (Digital Signal Processor), which is being managed by the OsmocomBB software, and lack of GPRS support. Moreover, these phones are not manufactured anymore, so it's not so easy to find them nowadays.

Taking the known problems and limitations into account, and having a strong desire to give everyone the new possibilities for research and education in the telecommunications scope, we decided to write a 'bridge' between OsmocomBB and SDR. Using GNU Radio, a well known environment for signal processing, we have managed to get some interesting results, which we would like to share with community on the upcoming CCC.

I printed all the parts in blue, grey and black PLA filament and it held up surprisingly well! I would like to use nylon next time for long term toughness, but the performance was still smashing! I 3D printed almost all parts on the CR-10S which did a great job as always. For the assembly you are required 80 screws and 80 washers, I went with 2.5mm 12mm length screws with some M4 washers (4mm inner and 12mm outer) and that worked perfectly! All the parts popped in place, only minor sanding necessary, and the exoskeleton turned out looking madness! 3DPrintIt came up with a fantastic design and it even held up to some quite severe abuse. Smashing soda cans and even the 3D printed Terminator head, I only received scratches at the end of it.

THe CR-10 3D printer is $390 right now: https://goo.gl/bJFYTB

Canal do meu amigo desenhista: https://goo.gl/Qot7qE

Nos seus olhos há um azul profundo
um para amar e um para se perder
uma doce indecisão, uma verdade pesada
água ou vinho, não me faça escolher

quero me sentir como nos sentimos naquela noite de verão
embriagados de sentimento, sozinhos com as estrelas no céu

estive correndo pela selva
estive correndo com os lobos para chegar até você
passei pelos becos mais sombrios
vi o lado negro da lua para chegar até você
procurei por amor em todos os estranhos
foi preciso muita coisa para acalmar a raiva
tudo por você
estive correndo pela selva
estive correndo com os lobos para chegar até você

para chegar até você
para chegar até você

a ponta dos seus dedos desliza na minha pele
em lugares aonde eu nunca fui
eu vou seguindo às cegas
derrube as paredes e entre
quero me sentir como nos sentimos naquela noite de verão
embriagados de sentimento, sozinhos com as estrelas no céu

estive correndo pela selva
estive correndo com os lobos para chegar até você
passei pelos becos mais sombrios
vi o lado negro da lua para chegar até você
procurei por amor em todos os estranhos
foi preciso muita coisa para acalmar a raiva
tudo por você
estive correndo pela selva
estive correndo com os lobos para chegar até você

estive correndo pela selva
estive correndo com os lobos para chegar até você
passei pelos becos mais sombrios

Elleman rooted his analysis in a close examination of the rockets used on North Korea's latest tests — which looked a lot like ones that were once made in the Yuzhmash factory, in the eastern Ukrainian town of Dnipro.

But at the factory itself — which since the fall of the Soviet Union has been rebranded as a space-exploration agency — officials were in a panic. They adamantly denied having anything to do with North Korea. And they let VICE News visit, the first time American cameras were allowed inside, in an attempt to prove they had nothing to hide.

Fergie received a TON of backlash and criticism following her national anthem performance and she’s got something to say about it.  

Can you blame Fergie Ferg for wanting to change things up a bit?
It has been said time and time again by some of the most incredible and notable singers that the Star Spangled Banner is not an easy song to perform. However, after singing the national anthem a couple of times over the years – once for President Obama and another time at an NFL game -- Fergie decided to change up the usual, classic rendition for a different one at the NBA All-Star game and needless to say, it fell flat. 

Quite a few celebs at the game could NOT keep a straight face during Fergie’s performance and after the camera panned over to Draymond Green, you can hear the crowd cheering but also laughing at the same time in the background. 

And after that performance, a TON of people on Twitter were wondering what was going on in Fergie’s mind after that…interesting rendition. One user joked, “Fergie’s national anthem finished 30 minutes ago and I still haven’t recovered. A part of me will never be the same.” While another wondered if Fergie tried to, “Marilyn Monroe the Star Spangled Banner?”

Well, wonder no more because Fergie released a statement, explaining her artistic decision, saying QUOTE, “I’ve always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA. I’m a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn’t strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best.”
Poor Fergie, the world just wasn’t ready for the national anthem to be changed.

CHECK OUT THIS EPIC VLOG! Thanks again to our sponsor Hot Wheels for partnering with us to make this epic track! Check out the video we partnered with them for on the Hot Wheels Channel - http://bit.ly/2nB9WVN

Today Stephen Sharer and his brother Carter Sharer set out to make the most epic Hot Wheels track ever. They went to the backyard to make a track all the way down the hill. Stephen started connecting Hot Wheels track together to make a long strait section with the Track Builder. Carter got to work on making turns and jumps with the Stunt Box. Soon the Sharer Bros were done building this epic 200ft Hot Wheels track that travels all the way down the backyard. Stephen put a Hot Wheels car onto the track and launched it down the course. The car started rolling down the hill gaining speed. It went through a series of turns and jumps and then down the long strait away. The Hot Wheels car was going super fast by the time it got all the way to the bottom of the hill. The last obstical was the Stunt Bridge. The Hot Wheels car then launched off the Stunt Bridge and flew through the air before landing in the grass. This vlog was super awesome! Shoutout to #HotWheels for partnering with us!

Lyrics:

Shivering Gold

A minute of truth time, talkin' 'bout stuff
Keep saying I'm danger, but thinking I'm love
I'm out on the dance floor, drinking my tears
Acting all cliché, and facing my fears

Curious minds
Hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Wet, dripping
Curious minds
Lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold
Wild, real
Got things like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold

Kissing it better, a physical face
Taking your body, I sit on your face
I see you smiling, covered in me
Moving too fast now, but fuck it, we're free

Curious minds
Hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Wet, dripping
Curious minds
Lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide (wider)

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold
Wild, real
Got things like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold

Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter

Curious minds
Hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Curious minds
Lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold
Wild, real
Got things like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold

Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13ZNc6h0mbM/sddefault.jpg,0.011821274235979144,0.00016906856744821434,69.92,0.00014878033935442859,0.011990342803427359,0.012139123142781786,2017-11-19,05:15:25,Sunday,6,6,1,6,1,32,2,3,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.617907400209159,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

I headed down to radical bikes bikepark in Essex with the free bike challenge bike and decided to hit the jumps hard and ended up doing so pretty crazy tricks.

This is the last episode of the free bike challenge and I'll be giving this bike away next week, follow my Instagram to find out how to get it: @sampilgrim

It was good to ride with tom cardy and jack cardy who were also hanging out at the bike park!!

Give me some ideas, what bike shall I destroy next!!! 

Hope you enjoy the video!

The Ryobi P191 18V 3Ah battery is just as powerful as the 6Ah, with a smaller footprint. I didn't see any performance boost with brushed tools though. Ryobi decided to go with better power output instead of a slim pack design though, which I would have preferred.

Lyrics:
I can picture everything 
In the streetlight where you came to me
In the middle of your high
Hearing all the words you said
But you don’t remember them
I’m the one who never lied

They will always tell you yes but I’ll tell you no
Forever
They will always see the best but we’re going home
Together

Oh it’s easy to be fooled
Into all the late night games
Is it ever feeling real
We can change and make it right
If you ever see the light
Tell the devil it’s a deal

They will always tell you yes but I’ll tell you no
Forever
They will always see the best but we’re going home
Together

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/16Z3sy4NNWM/sddefault.jpg,0.012007450799481229,0.0001436193825236972,83.60606060606061,0.0002255839796205547,0.012151070182004928,0.01237665416162548,2018-02-02,09:35:00,Friday,4,6,38,6,33,34,334,1,79,0,1,5,14,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.255744160919861,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

🔉 Greyson Chance Low Lyrics 🔉
[Chorus]
I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

[Post-Chorus]
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know

[Verse 1]
I see a dark reflection in my dashboard
Don't even know where I'm driving to anymore
I think about us back together someday
What you doing this Sunday
I needed space so I left home
But now I'm desperate for the things I know
Like how you made me laugh on a bad day
Where are you now, I need you babe

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know where to go, yeah

[Chorus]
Cause I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

[Post-Chorus]
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know

[Verse 2]
Remember older days when we were so young
Riding top down in a city that I used to love
I hear those words you said when you were shit faced
Told me to stop playing all those games
But I wasn't then, and I'm not now
Didn't know how to feel when you broke me down
I needed time to move around without you
But I think I'm ready to hear I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know where to go, yeah

[Chorus]
Cause I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

[Post-Chorus]
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know

More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show did NOT go as smoothly as originally planned, and now Bella Hadid’s getting REAL about it on Instagram.

That’s right, you guys! Bella Hadid took to Instagram to share an emotionally loaded post about making it through this year’s VS Fashion Show despite its MANY hiccups.

In the post, she wrote, QUOTE, “Yesterday was so unreal on so many levels. It took so much for all of this to come together and truly as a team we pulled it together as a WHOLE.” 

So what exactly went wrong? Well, for starters, the event took place in China, and reportedly, a total of FOUR of the models were denied entry into the country a mere few days before they were supposed to hit the runway! What a disaster! Also, just one day after that, Bella’s sister Gigi took to Twitter to share that even though she had a confirmed spot on the runway, she would NOT be flying to Shanghai to participate in the show. Uhh… what?!

So who else was MIA at this year’s show? None other than Kendall Jenner, who according to reports, couldn’t participate this year because she’s currently under contract with a different lingerie brand! 

But wait… it gets worse! Models weren’t the only ones denied entry into China for the show! Katy Perry, who was scheduled to be the musical guest, was reportedly, QUOTE, “banned from China indefinitely,” making it impossible for her to follow through with her performance. What a mess!

But, even after all of that bad luck, it kinda seemed like things were finally beginning to turn around when HollywoodLife reported that The Weeknd sent Bella a HUGE bouquet of flowers and a sweet note in an effort to rekindle their romance once again. But alas, the reports do not seem to have a reliable source, so we’re going to say this never actually happened. Bummer! 

It wasn’t all bad news, though, because as Bella did say that they were somehow able to pull it together and put on a pretty good show!

But what do you guys think of that Bella and The Weeknd Rumor? Do you still ship them together and would you be down to see them give it another go? Let us know in the comments section below, and as always, don’t forget to subscribe! Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey, and I’ll see you next time!

The film is an adventure into a dark criminal underworld, where Han Solo meets his future copilot Chewbacca and encounters Lando Calrissian years before joining the Rebellion. The film was screened for press and some members of the media ahead of time.

Jedi Council’s Kristian Harloff and Ken Napzok are here to give you their SPOILER filled review of the movie and let you know if it’s worthy installment in the Star Wars franchise. They explore the acting, direction, action and overall storyline of the film. They also let you know if Ron Howard was successful in taking the film over and putting his own spin on the Han Solo tale.

Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, and the rest of the ensemble of Three Billboards were ecstatic upon hearing the film’s name called for the Best Ensemble Film Cast award. Considering the SAG awards are all about celebrating nothing but the acting in the films and TV shows it honors, it’s a huge deal to receive the award for best ensemble. The competition was truly fierce in the category, with the Three Billboards casting beating out the casts of Get Out, Lady Bird, Mudbound, and The Big sick for the win.

Frances McDormand, who also won the Outstanding Performance by an Actress award for her work in the film, gave a short and sweet speech on behalf of the cast that was filled with gratitude for everyone who was a part of bringing the movie to life. 

Thanks to the flawless cast bringing humor, depth, and dimension to every single character, Three Billboards is shaping up to be the award season contender to beat. We’ll definitely be expecting the film to receive more than a couple Oscar nominations, especially in the performance categories for SAG winners Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. ‘

Alright guys now I wanna know what YOU thought of Three Billboards winning the Ensemble Cast award, and which other ensembles were your favorites to watch? Let me know in the comments below, and after that click right over here to check out the best actor and actress winners from the show.

The bill, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is set to bring about widespread changes to the US tax code for both businesses and individual Americans.

The bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, and most — but not all — Americans are likely to see a smaller tax bill.

ABOUT BEARDBRAND
Beardbrand is a men’s grooming company that is helping men keep on growing by providing education and tools for urban beardsmen to master their morning routine. We’ve found that confidence starts with self investment, and allows men to do great things for their families, co-workers, and community. We are working to break down the negative stereotypes that surround bearded men, and show the world it’s the man who matters, not the way he looks.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

During an interview with Howard Stern on his Radio show this morning, Cardi opened up about how she feels about nicki minaj, the media, and her fans. According to photos taken at the Gala, the two rappers were seen chatting with each other inside the event. 

On Howard Stern however, we are thankful that he asked all the right questions. He simply asked “are you feuding with anybody?”

To which she simply replied “I never was feuding with anybody; there was a misunderstanding. She continued on to say “I think she felta certain type of way about something. I definitely felt a certain type of way about something. I didn’t ever wanna talk about it in public because i felt like we gonna see each other again and we will talk about it, and it’s always like little issues. The thing is, it’s always little issues but you know, fans are always gonna make it a big thing.” Cardi continued, she said QUOTE “I spoke to her about it -- i spoke to her at the met gala about it, and it’s just like, see? It’s just something that had to be talked about because it was an issue.” 

So that’s a lot to digest, and even though Howard Stern pressed her to divulge what the personal feud was. Cardi held strong and never said what the particular problem was. But she did say it’s the media’s fault for pitting women in hip hop against one another by constantly trying to capitalize on drama. Also, cardi mentioned that her fans tend to do the same. She said “it’s the fans and it’s the people, because the people get entertained by other people’s problems and conflict.”

Cardi wore a cream Moschino beaded dress and a headpiece designed by Jeremy Scott, and Nicki wore a red Oscar de la Renta Gown and Tiffany jewelry. All in all the met gala was a success, and it looks like the whole rumor of a cardi b nicki minaj feud is officially dead… for now.

Now it’s your tur, what do you think of this cardi B nicki minaj feud? What team were you on? Whatever it is, prop to these girls for talking out their problems face to face. That definitely needs to happen more in our world. But that’s not the end of Cardi B in the news, click right over here to see cardi b’s team attack a man at the met gala. I’m tom plumley, thanks for watching clevver news.

See if first on Digital Download January 23, 2018.

The first true Elseworlds tale from DC comes to animated life as a steampunk Batman hunts Jack the Ripper through the shadows of turn-of-the-century Gotham City in Batman: Gotham By Gaslight. 

Inspired by the landmark one-shot Elseworlds tale by Brian Augustyn and Mike Mignola, Batman: Gotham By Gaslight takes place at the turn of the century as America’s continued industrial revolution is to be showcased at a World’s Fair hosted by Gotham City. But while the world prepares to witness the glittery glory of Gotham’s technological advances, there is a killer loose in the city’s darkest shadows. Preying on the city’s women, this killer is as precise as he is cruel. As Police Commissioner James Gordon tries to calm the fears of Gotham’s citizens regarding the butcher called Jack the Ripper, the masked vigilante Batman enacts his own detective work – with the help of confident, capable Selina Kyle – to stop the Ripper’s murderous spree. Witness a world in flames as the notorious serial killer’s controlled savagery meets the calculated stealth of the Dark Knight.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

The Victoria’s Secret Fashion show is a huge production every year. Here are 10 secrets you might not know about the show! The show is actually held twice. Footage from the two shows is edited together to create the final product that is eventually aired on TV. Did you know that one of Fantasy Bras set a Guinness world record? Typically though, the fantasy bras aren’t ever sold and end up being dismantled after the show takes place.

LYRICS:
Beware the serpents in the leaves,
& their deception,
An outstretched h&, Closed to a fist,
Becomes a weapon.

I see the damage they have done.
I see the battle’s just begun.
I know the answer lies inside,
I feel it when I close my eyes.

Through disaster & decay,
Survive to fight another day.
When there's no time for you to question,
Every single step you take,
Press on, & trust in your instincts.

Break down the barriers of fear,
& superstition.
Listen to your primal past,
& intuition.

You'll see the damage they have done
You'll see the war is never won,
You'll know the answer lies inside.
You'll feel it when you close your eyes.

Kill or be killed, (stand & fight)
sink or swim, (run & hide)
The answer lies within

(SOULCALIBUR VI) Injustice 2's newest gameplay from EVO Japan just revealed a ton of unexpected stuff. For starters, Siegfried underneath Nightmare's helmet inside of SC6! When Nightmare was going up against new character Groh, his helmet gets cracked and reveals the fan favorite Siegfried. Personally, this is pretty intriguing to me for a few reasons. For starters, what does this mean for Siegfried in Soul Calibur 6? Will he be his own stand alone character? Or will he just be part of Nightmare? This is something that's being debated at this point in time and hopefully, will be answered soon. Anyways, what do you all think of this new look for Nightmare? Do you think we'll see Siegfried getting his own character? Do you think he'll just be part of Nightmare? Be sure to let me know inside of the comment section below!

[ SOYOU ]

The colors painted by SOYOU, the first step as a solo artist
SOYOU’s growth process from SISTAR to an artist 
 
The title track ‘The Night’ is produced by a hit song maker Primary in the R&B genre with the wintery mood melody. The lyrics that visually described the exciting feelings of men and women go together with the voice of SOYOU. The song featured Geeks who have collaborated with her since ‘Officially Missing You, Too’ in 2012, raising the degree of the song’s completion.

There is no entry fee, no prize money, and no support -  no one will be there to rescue you. The HT550 is a self-timed Individual Time Trial, but while planing you better divide the trail into sections of hours used, not kilometres. 

All that is provided by the organisors is inspiration, a suggested start time, a GPS track file, and a list of completion times. 

Joachim experienced Scotland's beautiful mountain streams and lochs for almost 6 days. One challenge beside the actual ride with all its meters of elevation (18.500m) is the weather in Scotland - as it can change on a whim, and you may find yourself getting besieged by cold lashing rain and high winds.

There were 10 votes in favor, 1 against and 4 abstentions.

Full meeting is available on UN Web TV: http://webtv.un.org

The United Nations Security Council on Friday failed to adopt two competing draft resolutions; one produced by Kuwait, in response to the killing of dozens of Palestinian protestors in Gaza, and the other tabled by the United States, which vetoed the initial resolution saying it was “grossly one-sided” against Israel.

The draft proposed by Kuwait garnered 10 votes in favour, but the US vetoed the text, which it said failed to even mention Hamas, and the group’s responsibility for protecting civilians.

Four countries abstained. If one of the Council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom or the US – casts a negative vote on a resolution, the text cannot be adopted.

The draft would have urged the Council to consider “measures to guarantee the safety and protection” of Palestinian civilians and requests a report from the UN Secretary-General on a possible “international protection mechanism.”

VERSE 1:
The passion of our Saviour
The mercy of our God 
The cross that leaves no question 
Of the measure of His love 

CHORUS:
Our chains are gone
Our debt is paid
The cross has overthrown the grave
For Jesus’ blood that sets us free
Means death to death
And life for me

VERSE 2:
The Innocent judged guilty
While the guilty one walks free
Death would be His portion
And our portion liberty

BRIDGE:
I give my whole life
To honour this love 
By the Lamb who was slain
I’m forgiven

The sinner’s Saviour
Crown Him forever
For the Lamb who was slain
He is risen

I loved this movie sooo much, it was beautiful in every way, from the cinematography to the soundtrack to the love story. Especially the love story. I just had to vid it. It felt really good to make a long, voiceover-based video again, it's been a while. It ended up having like a thousand and one glitches though, which was just the worst. I didn't manage to get them all out but if I had to render this thing one more time I think I would've gone insane. Hope it's not too distracting.

The fire is raging for a second day following a collision with a Hong Kong grain ship in the East China Sea. Concerns are growing that the Sanchi tanker, run by Iran's top oil shipping operator, may explode and sink as the inferno grows. The search team has yet to find any of the missing mariners aboard the tanker. 

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong freight ship suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, have been rescued. The 
two vessels collided about 160 nautical miles off China's coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River on Saturday evening.

Lyrics:
I, I’ve been up all week
Not getting any sleep
Trying to read the signs
I, don’t know how much more I can take
How much longer I can wait
Before I lose my mind
You, for heaven’s sake
You take my breathe away
When you’re not even trying
You got me wondering what, what if you were mine

Oh baby
Come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
Tell me you love me
It’s easy
Just say what’s on your mind
Say it a million times
Tell me you love me

Come on,
I know it’s way too soon
But I waited for you
And I think that’s long enough
So long,
To all those lonely nights
Battles and picking fights
It’s already been done
I, can’t believe my eyes
How on earth did I find
Myself so far in love
We, could be the perfect match
And what's so wrong with that

Oh baby
Come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
Tell me you love me
It’s easy
Just say what’s on your mind
Say it a million times
Tell me you love me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1MSMYZqpg5o/sddefault.jpg,0.020509161568472663,0.00042885552502542766,47.82300884955753,0.0006262049701698723,0.02093801709349809,0.021564222063667968,2017-12-15,05:00:46,Friday,4,11,74,10,29,57,498,4,67,0,1,8,5,3,18,4.0,6.0,['Ua'],['Ua'],True,['Ua'],1,1,2,0,0,1,0,6.17018201893464,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

But it's easy to forget that behind all of the music is a very ordinary person, and sometimes, that ordinary person is a terrible human being...

1) Zack Snyder Was Reportedly Fired from ‘Justice League’

2) Michael Fassbender to Star in Bonkers 80s ‘Kung Fury’ Feature from David Sandberg

3) Switch the Script 

4) ‘The Irishman’ Could End up Being Martin Scorsese’s Most Expensive Movie Ever

5) Chris Columbus To Write & Direct Fright Feature ‘Five Nights At Freddy’s’ For Blumhouse

6) 'Paddington' Director Paul King in Talks for 'Willy Wonka' 

7) Live Twitter Questions

One of the biggest stories of last year came in May when it was reported that Zack Snyder was stepping away from Justice League after a family tragedy. Joss Whedon took over directing duties and the rest, as they say, is history. Veteran entertainment reporter Josh L. Dickey however, recently revealed that he is now leaving the industry and his outlet Mashable, and took to Twitter for one last report - revealing that Snyder was actually fired in January or February of 2017, three months before the news broke that he was leaving Justice League.

According to Variety, Michael Fassbender has signed on to star in David Sandberg’s action-comedy Kung Fury. David Hasselhoff, who was in the original cult short film, is also on board to appear. Released in 2015, Kung Fury was a Kickstarter record-breaking success, and was selected for Cannes Directors Fortnight. 

SWITCH THE SCRIPT 

According to Deadline, Martin Scorsese’s latest – The Irishman – is now reported to be Scorsese’s most expensive film in the making. Originally budgeted for $125 million at Netflix, the costs are now said to be ballooning to $140 million range and climbing. 

Yesterday, Blumhouse Pictures took to their Twitter account to announce that Chris Columbus has signed on to write, direct and produce their screen adaptation of Scott Cawthon’s popular video game Five Nights at Freddy’s. The movie based on the popular game centers on a security guard battling animatronic robots that come to life in a Chuck E. Cheese-like venue. 

THR reports that Paul King, the director of the two acclaimed Paddington movies, is in final negotiations to direct Willy Wonka, a reimagining of Roald Dahl's classic children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; that’s being developed at Warner Bros.

8. Akhal-Teke
This heavenly horse is also the national emblem of Turkmenistan! This kind of horse is known worldwide for its speed, endurance, intelligence, and of course, its beauty. Did I mention that it can also adapt to severe climatic conditions? Gosh, what can’t it do!?
It is also one of the oldest breed of horses that still exist today. Maybe. Scientists can’t say for sure, because it’s pretty hard to determine our own human history, let alone horse history! In any case, the ancestors of this breed date back to horses that lived 3000 years ago! The famous historian Herodotus even mentioned this horse. Some say that the Akhal-Teke is a direct descendant of the Turkoman horse, a breed that is now extinct. The Akhal-Teke is listed as threatened, which is extremely rare with domestic animals.
This horse is also famous for its metallic sheen, caused by its extremely fine hairs. It always looks super glossy and shiny no matter what the color.
The younger ancestors of Akhal-Teke were golden, but now it is one of the few horse breeds that has a wide range of colors. The 3 main colors are black, bay and red. The stallions of this breed have influenced many breeds and were often given to Heads of State and important people in foreign lands.

7. Sorraia
Sorraia is a very rare breed of horse, specific to the Iberian Peninsula, in the area surrounding the Sorraia River in Portugal. Hence the name. Previously the breed was simply known by the locals as “zebro” or “zebra”. This is because newborn foals, were born with hair that would lay in stripe-like patterns. This horse is known for its primitive features and they lived practically wild on a large estate until 1999. When outsiders discovered them in 1920, few could believe that a wild horse subspecies had survived in Europe for that long.
This entire breed was isolated and unknown to science for such a long time that we don’t really know much about their past. What we’ve found out is that they share similar characteristics with Mustangs in the western part of the United States.
This suggests that Spanish conquistadors took Iberian horses to the Americas during their trips abroad and one breed must have been the ancestor of the Sorraia. Today the breed is almost extinct, with less than 200 horses existing as of 2007. They are mainly found in Portugal, but also in Germany, where they are used for different things like herding bulls, dressage riding or light harness.

6. German Forest Horse
Also known as the Black Forest Draft Horse, this horse is a small but very tough draft breed with a high fertility rate and a long life span. Even though they are tough, this breed is almost extinct. They are about 600 years old, and for most of the time, this breed was used almost exclusively for forestry work because of their immense strength, patience and gentle temperament. They also have a dark chestnut coat with a flaxen mane and tail, their short head has small ears and large eyes, their chest is broad, and their legs are trim and strong with little feathering. The most common color for them is dark chestnut, but they can also be gray or bay.
They began to decline during the 20th century when their jobs were taken by machines. Back in 1981 only 160 registered broodmares were reported! Since then the government stepped in to help protect the Black Forest horse breed and only the finest stock was used, so now they boast that those that remain are of the best quality.
Today a major breeding center is located at Marbach, where only 16 from a total of 46 State Approved Stallions are located. The rest are scattered in different private breeding facilities.

What do you guys think we will see in this spin-off film? Could we see Han Solo and his new crew take on the Empire? I think this movie will be tons of fun and a completely different feel from Star Wars the Last Jedi with Luke Skywalker, Snoke, Kylo Ren, Rey etc etc...I think it'll be nice to get back to the original/prequels with Darth Vader, Boba Fett...and MY THEORY as to perhaps even Darth Maul to make an appearance.

According to the site, it appears to be a suicide.

Salling, 35, was best-known for his role on Glee as Noah ""Puck"" Puckerman, which he held from 2009-2015. He was scheduled to be sentenced in March for having over 25,000 images and hundreds of videos of child porn on his computers and flash drives. As part of his plea deal, he was facing between 4-7 years behind bars, as opposed to the potential maximum of 20. He also had to pay $50,000 to each victim requesting payment—a condition that could potentially have cost him millions.

Salling reportedly slit his wrists in August of last year, about a month and a half before his plea bargain. He survived and was put in rehab for psychological issues, according to TMZ. He was accused of rape by a former girlfriend in 2016, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney ultimately decided not to pursue the case. The year prior, Stalling paid another woman $2.7 million to settle a claim of sexual battery.

Lyrics

Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
In your sleep ""Don't let the morning take him""
Outside the birds begin to call
As if to summon up my leaving


It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
Oh please don't take it all away


It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving

Oh please don't take it all away


Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
In your sleep ""Don't let the morning take him""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1Qjoffl_Lgo/sddefault.jpg,0.012844945875895715,0.0003074655689383544,41.776859504132226,0.0005742745337195711,0.01315241144483407,0.013726685978553642,2018-05-03,07:00:02,Thursday,3,7,69,7,33,38,494,3,70,0,0,5,30,2,7,5.0,6.0,['UC 11:'],"['UC', '11:']",True,"['UC', '11', ':']",3,3,5,1,1,0,0,4.796568211440912,5,"['neutral', 'happy', 'sad', 'happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,2,1,0,2,{'person': 5},5

Mas Hashimoto will compare how Japanese American incarceration during WWII and the massive discrimination of Muslims post 9-11 are both founded in hate and racism.  Learn how “Make America Great Again” really translates to “Make America White Again.”  Learn about what you can do to stop this form of racism and take active steps to protect everyone’s civil and human rights. Mas Hashimoto was a child when his family was taken from their Watsonville home in 1942.  He was sent to a federal prisoner of war camp during WWII because of racism, war hysteria, and political leadership failure. Mas taught US History in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District until his retirement.  He speaks to groups of students about the wartime experience of Japanese Americans during WWII to ensure that this injustice never repeats itself again. Mas also headed the Re-enactment of the Incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII: “Liberty Lost; Lessons in Loyalty” in 2002, and serves on the Board of Directors of the Watsonville-Santa Cruz chapter Japanese American Citizens League. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1W3A2hQhdg4/sddefault.jpg,0.008827144562447287,0.00017559303315396897,50.27047146401985,0.00035539797529178,0.009002737595601256,0.009358135570893036,2018-04-13,08:35:00,Friday,4,8,37,8,32,54,326,2,77,0,1,5,16,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.373343964050085,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

and Singapore.
~ Many endangered species live here such as turtles and seals.

Arctic Ocean: Located around the North Pole across the Arctic circle
~ Home to many of the Polar Bears of the world.
~ Smallest ocean and most shallow, but is the coldest.
~ Sometimes called the “frozen ocean”, almost completely covered in ice during the winter,

Original creators are  Jaiden and Boyinabad
The original video :  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=36QMyiRAv-Y

the original artists for the art  is CrystaHerb

[Verse 1: Boyinanband]
Mirror mirror on the wall, yeah
Tunnel vision on the flaws
In the scale of things it’s unimportant
So no talking, but it’s still an intrusive thought
Tried hard to correct it, yeah
But nothing was effective, uh
No one else seemed so obsessed with it
Things were desperate until the voice crept in
""I can help you, trust me, you’re ready""
It seemed dangerous
But it said to have faith in it
""The secret is to just be empty""
Didn’t know if it was wise to listen, but
What could it hurt to try?

[Verse 2: Jaiden]
And at first, it was working
But then things were emerging
Cracked lips and tired eyes
I’m hungry with no appetite
I’m shivering and shaking, and I tell myself it’s fine, but
You can’t fool your body, you can only fool your mind, yeah
Empty
I just need to be empty
Hide from anybody who’ll prevent me
Just fill up on water and shame
No, I’m not hungry, I just ate
I’ve developed a taste for this
Endure the neverending ache
Convince myself I’m in control and it’s not
All that voice that makes me sick


[Chorus: Boyinaband & Jaiden]
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
I’m looking, but I can’t see myself
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
But it’s so hard to stop it alone

[Verse 3: Boyinaband]
Been getting even worse
All the days begin to merge, yeah
Just a blurry haze and now it’s
Almost second nature to ignore the urges
Can’t trust my own nature
Every calorie a failure
Gotta push the intake down every day
‘Cause the voice comes back to say
""You want to eat? Bite your tongue""
Don’t want to stay an embarrassment
Just have to stomach it
""They don't know what you want""
A tug of war against common sense
Don’t wanna believe that I’ve overstepped

[Verse 4: Jaiden]
But it’s so overwhelming
And I hope no one can tell
‘Cause the numbers keep decreasing
This ordeal is becoming routine, check
Arms, back, neck, thighs
Suck it in and pinch my sides
The scales are betraying me
The mirror is a lie, yeah
Numbers
It all comes down to numbers
I know it’s wrong but
Just because you know you’re colorblind
Doesn’t mean you can see the colors
Fine, I admit I’m addicted
But the hunger feels good, how do I quit this
I know I could die, I’ve seen the statistics
But the voice is with me through thick and thin


[Chorus: Boyinaband & Jaiden]
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
I’m looking, but I can’t see myself
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
But it’s so hard to stop it alone
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
I’m looking, but I can’t see myself
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
But it’s so hard to stop it alone

[Bridge: Boyinaband & Jaiden]
I can reach out
To someone not like me
If you ask for help it, doesn’t make you weak
I can reach out
Ignore what the voice tells me
I can help my mind learn to trust my body
I can reach out
To someone not like me
If you ask for help it, doesn’t make you weak
I can reach out
Ignore what the voice tells me
I can help my mind learn to trust my body


[Chorus: Boyinaband & Jaiden]
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
I’m looking, but I can’t see myself
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I know, I know it’s wrong
But it’s so hard to stop it alone
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I can reach out (I can reach out oh-oh-oh-oh)
Inside it’s em-em-em-empty
I can reach out (I can reach out)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1XUyJXNqb0M/sddefault.jpg,0.02457459413898831,0.0019575388148492,12.553822152886115,0.005051121996506358,0.02653213295383751,0.031583254950343864,2018-06-08,21:55:49,Friday,4,8,18,8,18,52,191,5,37,0,0,5,6,0,0,6.0,10.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.019381573988402,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

I know I went on and on in the video about this already, but seriously, thank you for the homies who are watching now.  I know the channel has been through a ton of changes, and a lot of people feel like the related more in the past, but I'm doing what I believe, will, first of all, make me happiest, but producing the kind of content I feel serves better.

Writers, costume designers, stylists, choreographers and, of course, make-up artists. But we're sure many people don't even realize how complex and thorough their work is, and how long it takes to turn a person into a fantastic character. In today's video we'll reveal this secret and show you what's going on on the other side of the screen, on the set and in the dressing room.

Do not purchase this machine. It has been many months since I made this video, and there are better machines on the market now. I recommend the CNC 1310 which will function pretty much the same using the same hardware (Arduino) and firmware (GRBL).

NOTE 2: AutoDesk killed ArtCAM on Feb 7 2018. As a replacement Carveco seems to be a complete clone of ArtCAM, but it is a paid program. https://carveco.com/software-range/carveco/

VIDEO DESCRIPTION:
Assembling a mini CNC machine, and using it to engrave some wood. The whole process is shown in detail from building the machine to running the software. If you were ever curious about CNC machining, this is a great place to start.

NOTE: Don't ever buy anything from Gearbest which isn't on sale. They like to play games with pricing. Here is the purchase link which they gave to me, if you wait for a sale you will be able to get it for $169-$179 instead of whatever high price this link is: https://bit.ly/2K809jU Don't buy it for more than $180, there are better CNC machines on Ebay and aliexpress. This one looks amazing: https://bit.ly/2MDWqMm
