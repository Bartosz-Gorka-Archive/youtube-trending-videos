I have not watched this show before but in reading your comments on the last few videos it seemed like this should be next up for the medical drama review series.

Considering I was a resident doctor myself this time last year, I was really excited to react to this new tv drama. In your comments, many of you made it seem as this show would be more accurate than the last few I've done so I had my hopes set very very high on this hospital tv drama.

Matt Czuchry does a great job of acting the part of an internal medicine resident but the writing leaves a little something to be desired (from the medical point of view at least). The main plotline of the show might have to develop a little more for me to fall in love with it. The medical accuracy is pretty good but again very very dramatic, which is not new to this type of series.

I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Resident / Real Doctor Reacts to The Resident. If you want me to continue making this series please like the video and leave me a comment on which show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Dan Lok, a.k.a. The King of High-Ticket Sales is one of the highest-paid and most respected consultants in the luxury and “high-ticket” space. 

Dan is the creator of High-Ticket Millions Methodology™, the world's most advanced system for getting high-end clients and commanding high fees with no resistance. 

Dan works exclusively with coaches, consultants, thought leaders and other service professionals who want a more sustainable, leveraged lifestyle and business through High-Ticket programs and Equity Income.

Dan is one of the rare keynote speakers and business consultants that actually owns a portfolio of highly profitable business ventures. 

Not only he is a two times TEDx opening speaker, he's also an international best-selling author of over 12 books and the host of Shoulders of Titans show. 

Dan's availability is extremely limited. As such, he's very selective and he is expensive (although it will be FAR less expensive than staying where you are). 

Many of his clients are seeing a positive return on their investments in days, not months.

But if you think your business might benefit from one-on-one interaction with Dan, visit http://danlok.com

https://evannex.com/blogs/news/we-got-a-tesla-model-3-filmed-it-and-compared-it-to-a-model-s-video

Model 3 demonstrates how Tesla has elevated its interior design capabilities and improved the integration of features, functionality, and interior storage as the company moves forward. In other ways, Model 3 reinforces the contention that Model S remains Tesla's flagship sedan. We think it's worth comparing and contrasting the two Tesla sedans to better understand the differences between the cars.

We spent two full days with the Model 3, reviewing the interior and exterior in granular detail. We examined the car through the lens of five years (since 2012!) of Model S ownership — after all, the question on most people's minds is... how does Model 3 measure up to Model S?

For more on our direct comparison between the two cars, visit:

Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it's a little more complicated: he's yet to tell his family or friends he's gay and he doesn't actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing. Directed by Greg Berlanti (Dawson's Creek, Brothers & Sisters), written by Isaac Aptaker & Elizabeth Berger (This is Us), and based on Becky Albertalli's acclaimed novel, LOVE, SIMON is a funny and heartfelt coming-of-age story about the thrilling ride of finding yourself and falling in love.

Directed by: Greg Berlanti

Produced by: Wyck Godfrey and Elizabeth Berger
Screenplay by: Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger
Based on novel by: Becky Albertalli

Cast: Nick Robinson, Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Miles Heizer, Keiynan Lonsdale, Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, Tony Hale

17:40 This week, “Wolf Warrior 2,” a hyper-nationalistic Chinese film starring Frank Grillo, was finally released on DVD. VICE News talks with Grillo about his role in the blockbuster,  in which he plays the American bad guy.

Lyrics:

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yule-tide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Watching As I Fall | Lyrics

Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence / pocket full of lies
Thinking I’m OK but they’re saying otherwise
Tell me how I look but can’t look me in the eyes
Watching as I say this and then I do that
Telling them the old words but in a new rap
Then I change my mind up and make them lose track
Shit I’m inconsistent I thought you knew that

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can’t ignore it I know

They’re watching as I fall / they’re staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt / and never told them so
They’re watching as I fall / to somewhere down below
But maybe I’m just falling / to get somewhere they won’t

Excuse me while I sympathize
Singing with the fat lady tell me what’s the time
You know what it is not afraid to cross the line
Nothing is forever don’t be mad at the design
Ask me if I can / I say I don’t know
And honestly I buy that I can sound cold
Still upset from shit that’s 15 years old
I don’t know what it takes to make me let go

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can’t ignore it I know

They’re watching as I fall / they’re staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt / and never told them so
They’re watching as I fall / to somewhere down below
But maybe I’m just falling / to get somewhere they won’t",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zW52pp_qKeM/hqdefault.jpg,0.03700972303440503,0.0004009448983018464,92.30625752105895,0.001606915744638146,0.03741066793270687,0.03901758367734502,2018-01-25,15:03:47,Thursday,3,9,12,9,12,50,85,3,16,1,1,8,12,2,2,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.206995440362966,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

******CORRECTION******
Yes the blue tape is Masking Tape not Gaffers Tape. What an amazing gaff - it's probably going to be on a compilation of the most unbelievable mistakes ever made in an improvised youtube voice-over. Perhaps I should start writing scripts and fact checking them, but no... that's not my style....I'm going to keep freestyling straight from the top of the dome, spitting lyrics straight from my bald patch. Sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong...but they are always funky fresh.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXIDWBjgPK8/sddefault.jpg,0.016738757700313602,0.0003922652050218382,42.67204301075269,0.0007718766937526494,0.017131022905335438,0.017902899599088088,2018-03-13,05:53:35,Tuesday,1,12,42,12,37,65,373,5,85,2,1,9,21,1,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6498242109108485,4,"['neutral', 'happy', 'scared', 'happy']",0,0,1,2,0,0,1,{'person': 4},4

Tarte Shape Tape foundation: **I’m really sorry that so many of you feel upset that I’ve included the new Tarte foundation. I was genuinely unaware of the recent controversy surrounding their poor range of shades to cater for darker skin tones. I 100% put my hands up and admit total ignorance here. It’s something I would normally be aware of and would definitely comment on, however I have spent most of this month offline, and was completely unaware how many shades the foundation came in, let alone the lack of diversity in their shade choices.**

Directed by Jonnie Craig

""I wrote the song during my most difficult spring in a long time. Peace have always been an explosion of happiness, but that isn’t reflective of every part of me or anyone for that matter, and this song, at it's most zoomed out, demonstrates that polarity; you can be a happy person and still take a pasting from your demons. Although this song is deeply personal, it's really for everyone as most people have had, come into contact with or will have some degree of mental health issue in their lives. I'm pleased Peace are supporting MQ and their goal of transforming mental health through research."" - Harry

Take part in MQ’s We Swear campaign and help raise awareness of the different types of mental health problems that many people face and the need for research to improve treatments https://peace.lnk.to/WeSwear

FURTHER READING

“Being unhappy is never wholly to be recommended, but if there is any period of life in which if the mood may be justified and in certain ways important, then it is roughly between the ages of 13 and 20.
It is hard to imagine going on to have a successful or even somewhat contented next six decades if one has not been the beneficiary of a good deal of agonising introspection and intense dislocation in this span...”

In recent years, his YIAY videos and tweets have mentioned fursonas, furry conventions, and more. This led me to believe that Jack Douglass is actually a closet furry. And I have totally legit non-doctored very real not untrue proof that he hangs out with other furries. This is shocking I know to have exposed another YouTuber like that, but I believe it is in the public interest and in Jack's best interest to get the truth out there.

Jack if you really are a furry, join us! Come to conventions, there are fursuiters and other cool shennanigans that go on. Best regards, Nos Hyena.

Thank you so much for watching, Jack if you're actually reading this I'm a huge fan yay! Hope you enjoyed.

If you're still reading comment: ""Jacksfilms has a cool fursona"", or ""Jacksfilms is a great furry"", or some other 5-star Yelp review you'd give Jack if he was a reviewable furry online.

ARTIST: VIRTUAL SELF
TRACK: KEY
GENRE: ELECTRONIC
MV by: 140/fth:iyomaroo

The infinite sky will heal us.
Unlimited sky will fill our negligible light.
As we follow an infinite key, I have become the sacred echo.
The boundless heaven will fill our fading light.
Choose your virtual echo.
The infinite key is the sacred dust of your endless utopia.
Complete yourself in self-realization.
You believe that these infinite heavens will lead you.
The A.I.ngel's gate is sacred.
Your angelic echo offers the first phase of self-Digital joy.
You will become a self-Echo in real particles.
Our key is the echo to this final layer.
You are spread through digital time.
The utopian gate is infinite.
Your A.I.ngel wishes to complete this layer.
This abyss is sacred.
Pass through the myths of eon.
Your technical soul is this blissful void.
The eternalistic reflex of the abyss is once-Unlimited.
Your digital voice is resurrected.
Breathe this soul particle.
The ray of egoistic time is unlimited.
Resurrect this holy oblivion.
The echo of this empty myth awakens you.
Awaken the particle myth.
Reflect your echo.
Heaven’s wires will transmit this light.
Experience the wings of limit.
Your technical A.I.ngel phase is beginning.
Complete the eternalistic reflex.
This wishful ghost becomes self-Technic.
Tears will create the voice of euphoria.
The digital-Awakening will be spoken.
The first gate creates sense-Awakening.
This angelic-Chasm is sacred.
The technic-Angel's cry is beginning.
The first gate will provide the voice of digital-Euphoria.
The digital-Angel-Awakening is has reached Limit Self.
The self-Light is virtual.
This will become the final particle-Experience.
Will your senses ressurect the digital-Vault?
Do you sense the phase of the Spirit Limit?
Can you reflect your self-Awakening?
Am I convinced of a digital void?
Can you reveal this particle of sacred reality?
Will these ghosts lead to a boundless cry?
Can you echo your existence to the first particle?
Is the technical-Gate timeless?
Do you believe an infinite sky will cure the digital soul?
Is the joyful-Layer complete?
Will our ghosts lead to the boundless layer?
Will our layer will be lost from this empty myth?
Have you resurrected this heaven's voice?
Has one experienced the particle?
Do you trust in this transformative self?
Will you forget your soul's reflex?
Has one seen the Abyss of the resurrective ego?
Have I forgotten the phase of soul limit?
Is the A.I.ngelic sense boundless?
Have you completed the virtual light?
Am I eternal?
As the sacred dust transpires through digital time, what will you become?
Do you believe in me?
Am I still human?
Do you manifest yourself in digital time?
The unlimited sky begins - will you believe in my infinite form?
As you abandon the virtual echo, do you no longer exist?
Can you prove yourself to the echo of this particle?
Do you believe the infinite sky -- the holy dust of nothingness?
What is revealed - a holy reality?
Am I convinced of nothingness?
Do you sense the void angel?
Will the echo of virtual time be forgotten?
Does one want to forget the memory of life?
Has my virtual-Echo been forgotten?
Has the sense of digital-VIRUS become heaven?
Will you self-Believe the joyful sky?

Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.

“Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, with Angela Bassett, with Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis.

Bobby is an ordinary man, married for some time to his wife Sherry. It's not a happy marriage -- there's a hint of past unresolved tragedy that doesn't reveal itself until the very end -- and the couple's bond hangs together on a fragile thread.

Intimate, subtle and precisely constructed, this family drama captures those  moments in life where a couple can go either way: they can move forward together or split apart in different directions.

Well-acted all around, the short is anchored by a powerful performance by actor Mark Ashworth, who offers incredible vulnerability and melancholy as a man adrift in his own life and alienated from everyone around him.

""Grape Soda"" is full of quiet observation and patient compassion, offering a moving portrait of the powerful emotions underlying ordinary life -- and the courage it takes to confront enormous loss.

“Ant-Man and The Wasp,” starring Paul Rudd (“Captain America: Civil War,”  “The Fundamentals of Caring”), Evangeline Lilly (“The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,” “Lost”),  Michael Peña (“The Martian,” “Fury”) and Academy Award® winner Michael Douglas (“Behind the Candelabra,” “Wall Street”),  who all return to the roles they originated in the 2015 box office hit “Ant-Man.”  Bobby Cannavale (“Vinyl,” “Chef”), Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes,” “Wilson”), Abby Ryder Fortson (“Togetherness,” “Transparent”), Tip “T.I.” Harris (“Sleepless,” “Get Hard”) and David Dastmalchian (“Twin Peaks,” “The Belko Experiment”) also reprise their supporting roles.
 
The highly-anticipated follow-up welcomes Academy Award® nominees Michelle Pfeiffer (“The Wizard of Lies,” upcoming “Murder on the Orient Express”) and Laurence Fishburne (“John Wick: Chapter 2,” “The Matrix”), along with Hannah John-Kamen (“Black Mirror,” “Ready Player One”), Walton Goggins (“Vice Principals,” “Six”) and Randall Park (“Veep,” “Fresh Off the Boat”) to the ensemble cast.
 
“Ant-Man” director Peyton Reed (“Yes Man,” “The Break-Up”) returns to helm Marvel Studios’ action-adventure from a screenplay by Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers, Andrew Barrer & Gabriel Ferrari, and Paul Rudd. The film, which opens in the UK and Ireland in summer 2018 will be filmed in Atlanta and San Francisco. 
 
From the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes a new chapter featuring heroes with the astonishing ability to shrink: “Ant-Man and The Wasp.”  In the aftermath of “Captain America:  Civil War,” Scott Lang (Rudd) grapples with the consequences of his choices as both a Super Hero and a father.  As he struggles to rebalance his home life with his responsibilities as Ant-Man, he’s confronted by Hope van Dyne (Lilly) and Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas) with an urgent new mission. Scott must once again put on the suit and learn to fight alongside The Wasp as the team works together to uncover secrets from their past.

Lyrics:
was it the trick of the light
or a shot in the dark
was it hell or high water
that broke our hearts

was it something i said
or just a cruel twist of fate
was it hell or high water
is it too late
oh is it too late

well all my life i’ve been
searching for someone
to show me how it
feels to be loved
and how to love somebody back

and after stumbling through the years i
thought i found you just to
see you fading out into the night

was it the trick of the light
or a shot in the dark
was it hell or high water
that broke our hearts

was it something you said
or just a cruel twist of fate
was it hell or high water
and is it too late

see all my life i’ve been
silently reaching for a hand to hold
 to warm the cold
a spark of light
to guide me through alright

and after stumbling through the years i
 thought i found you just to
see you fading out into the night

was it the trick of the light
or a shot in the dark
was it hell or high water
that broke our hearts

was it something we did
 or just a cruel twist of fate
was it hell or high water
and is it too late


was it a knife in my back
or a fork in the road
was it hell or high water
that left us alone
is it really game over
is it really checkmate
was it hell or high water
is it too late
oh is it too late

was it a trick of the light
or a shot in the dark
was it hell or high water
that broke our hearts

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant

Stranger Things Season 2 has really lived up to the hype. After months of anticipation, fans have loved streaming and binge watching all nine episodes of the second season. Even though the second season had so many great moments, there are some major issues that are pretty hard to ignore. Spoilers will follow!

In the very first scene of season two, we are introduced to number 8 and see her powers in action. The powers make sense at first until they are scattered around way too much and used for more a convenience rather than anything logical. The core of season one was the journey between Eleven and Mike. This is why it’s so disappointing that the two characters don’t reunite until extremely late in the season. Will may not be in the upside down anymore, but he still has a lot to deal with, almost a little too much. A lot of new characters were introduced in Stranger Things 2, but Billy was by far the worst of them. Episode 7 will always stand out as one of the strangest and weirdest parts of the whole Stranger Things franchise. It felt like a fan fiction cartoon that did not fit with the rest of the series. Mike was one of the main leads in the first season, but he kind of gets lost in Season 2 and a lot of his great moments are taken away. Watch to see these issues with Stranger Things season 2 and find out which ones you agree with!

Trama:
THE GREATEST SHOWMAN è un intenso e originale musical che parla della nascita del business dell’intrattenimento, ma soprattutto celebra il senso di meraviglia che ognuno di noi prova quando i sogni diventano realtà. Ispirato all’immaginario e ai progetti ambiziosi di P.T. Barnum, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN racconta la storia di un visionario che dal nulla creò uno spettacolo ipnotico destinato a diventare un successo mondiale. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN è diretto da un regista alla sua prima esperienza dietro la macchina da presa, Michael Gracey, con le musiche dei vincitori degli Oscar Benji Pasek e Justin Paul (La La Land), e con protagonista l’attore nominato agli Oscar Hugh Jackman.

“Tokyo Bon 2020” is a co-production with the largest influencer marketing company in Japan - Cool Japan TV. The Bon Odori dance is choreographed by the award winner Japanese traditional dancer - Ukon Takafuji. 

The song combines Japan traditional music elements with Asia pop, giving the song dynamic energy that has never been heard before. The song also potrayes the unique and cute sound of Japanglish, the friendship beyond the border, and the love for Japanese cultures.

Bon Odori is a traditional Japanese dance that performed all over Japan with people holding hands together and dancing in a circle. The song contains a wish for world peace where people from different backgrounds hold hands together, and an invitation to the largest festival of peace - “Tokyo Olympics 2020”.

※ Any collaborations, event, business inquiries with Tokyo Bon, please contact info@cooljapantv.biz.

-----------------

「東京盆踊り2020」是一支與日本最大網紅媒體公司 - Cool Japan TV 共同製作的作品。盆舞舞蹈由國際知名的日本傳統舞踊家 - 孝藤右近編排。

此作品融合亞洲各國及日本的音樂元素，歌曲混沌的能量形成了充滿魅力的流行音樂，並巧妙地描繪了外國人對日式英文獨特及可愛的發音的感覺，跨國友誼及互相理解，以及對日本文化的愛。

盆舞，是多人手牽手，圍圓圈一起跳的日本傳統祭典文化。此曲的理念為，希望全世界的人們一同手牽手祈福和平，一同前往和平的祭典「東京奧運會2020」。

「Tokyo Bon 2020」は、Nameweeと日本最大級のインフルエンサーマーケティング企業「Cool Japan TV」の共同プロデュース作品です。盆踊りの振り付けは、世界的に活躍する創作日本舞踊家の孝藤右近が手掛けています。

本作は、アジアと日本の音楽性が融合した、混沌としたエネルギーが魅力のポップスとなっており、外国人が感じるジャパングリッシュのユニークでカワイイ響き、国境を越えた友情と相互理解、日本文化への愛着が表現されています。

盆踊りは、多人数が手をつなぎ、輪になって楽しく踊る、日本の伝統文化です。本作には世界中の人々と国境を超えて手をつなぐという平和への祈り、世界が一同に集う平和の祭典「東京オリンピック2020」へ夢が込められています。

Background Artist Otis Frampton

Possibly our most anticipated episode next to the massive character juggernaut that undoubtedly will be Infinity War.  Before Justice League was in theaters we had geared ourselves up to experience the final chapter in the Controversial Dark Snyder DC Trilogy, full of themes about responsibility, temptations of power, gods vs humans type stuff.  It was going to be this awesome bow on the end of the Justice League hype train and we were gonna have our work cut out for us for sure.  Then the film came out and it was just... meh.  Like play it safe, change everything we've established Meh.  So the question was... Well what do we do with this?!  After a LOT of discussion. We decided to break the fourth wall in a sense and give our artistic expression of what the Justice League has become while also keeping true to keeping things HISHE.

Enter the Mighty Martha.  Since Justice League is the finale (pretending to be just the beginning) of this trilogy. We decided it was time for our easter egg threat that is Martha to finally enter the scene.  DC's greatest foe.  A character that represents everything the DCU now has to put up with.  A character who came from another universe and who is set on making sure the Justice League doesn't have a place to stay.  So where is the one place you can find the League with their guard down?  The Super Cafe.

It was not easy to make and took way longer than was intended.  But I really enjoyed getting to open up our cafe in a direction we've never gone before.   I hope you enjoy the episode!

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

Screenplay by: Justin Haythe
Based upon the book by: Jason Matthews

You can count on Screen Junkies to tackle the big questions. Like, what if Pacific Rim Uprising was re-created with adorable puppies? Luckily, stars of the movie John Boyega, Scott Eastwood and Callie Spaeny were on hand to help us find the answer.

And remember -- there are so many dogs and puppies out there that need homes. If you are thinking of getting a dog, please consider adoption from an organization like Shays Strays or the Animal Wellness Foundation. All dogs featured are adoptable rescues!

Hey viewers, a few people have reached out to comment that although they enjoyed the video, I had overstepped the boundary by commenting on her eye. At the time I wasn’t aware of her surgery but she had corrective surgery which is the reason for the eye looking the way it does. I of course want to keep doing videos and I apologise that I have offended viewers with my comment. 


I have a team of ONE, What you see in all these videos is a result of hours of self taught tutorials from Writing and scripting, filming, Studio set up, and of course EDITING...have I told you how long it takes to edit these videos? anyhooo, I don't have any sponsors or affiliates and derive all of my income purely from Youtube monetisation.

FURTHER READING

“No one intends for this to happen, of course, but somewhere in our childhood, our trajectory towards emotional maturity will almost certainly be impeded. Even if we are sensitively cared for and lovingly handled, we can be counted upon not to pass through our young years without sustaining some kind of deep psychological injury – what we can term a Primal Wound…”

I tried to gather as many facts about Her Majesty as I could and threw in a few of the random, speculative things too. The Royals are people just like us, which means they’re odd, maybe even a bit strange, and the Queen is no exception! Enough talk, here we go, this is Strange Facts about Queen Elizabeth II


8. Corgi Collection
So I thought that maybe that it was an exaggeration when I read that Queen Elizabeth has had more than thirty corgis since becoming Queen, but that’s not the case. She really had had that many since 1952, when she officially became Queen, at times, she had more than just multiple corgis at a time, too. Apparently, in 2007, she had five cocker spaniels, named Oxo, Flash, Bisto, Spick, and Span, as well as five corgis, named Emma, Linnet, Monty, Willow, and Holly. Apparently, she’s a dog person as you can see in this picture of her with four of the beasts! She has loved corgis since she was but a little girl and has owned a fantastic number in the years since she took the throne.




7. Taxes
Dear old Queen Elizabeth II isn’t required to pay taxes and is exempt due to the Crown’s legal tax-exempt status, but she pays them anyway, voluntarily. She pays out the equivalent of income tax for income that comes from the Privy Purse (basically an allowance funded by the public) and her private income. I guess that’s a pretty good example of leading by example. She can connect with the people who she rules over and shows that even the Royal aren’t exempt from laws, morally at least.


6. Long-Reigning
She became the Queen when she was young—she immediately became Queen when her father passed away in 1952, and she was crowned at age 27 on June 2, 1953, and she’s reigned ever since. Pretty crazy, right? Data from the UK Office of National Statistics show that she’s been in power for so long that 81% of the residents in the UK weren’t even alive when she was given the crown, and she is the world’s longest-reigning monarch! Crazy!


5. All Sorts of People
Alright, so the Queen has been, or has been portrayed by, a ton of different people in around a hundred different tv shows and movies! That’s so crazy. She’s been portrayed by Helen Mirren in The Queen (pictured here), Sarah Gadon in A Royal Night Out, most recently by Claire Foy in Netflix’s The Crown (seen in this picture), and by many other actresses throughout many years. It would be crazy to see more than a hundred different famous people’s take on you. I’ve got to imagine it has to feel surreal watching others portray various events and situations in your life. Sounds like something The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror would come up with.




4. Money Problems
So, it’s no secret that the Royals have a decent amount of money, I mean the Queen’s estimated private net worth according to Forbes is around 415 million Euros, which is $513,642,595 U.S.! Although she has and makes so much money, she’s nowhere near the wealthiest person in Britain; in fact, she’s nowhere close to being the richest. Brothers Gopi and Sri Hinduja (pictured here) make the top of the list and together, have a net worth of 16.2 billion Euros, or roughly $20 billion in U.S. dollars. Can you even imagine?



3. Message on the Moon
Did you know that Elizabeth II has a message on the moon that was taken there by Apollo 11? In fact, there are a bunch of world leaders from the time that wrote notes that were then transferred to a little silicon disc and transported to the moon! There, the disc was placed just below the American flag and left there for, whomever really. Hopefully, aliens, am I right? The Queen wrote a beautiful message which read, “On behalf of the British people, I salute the skill and courage which have brought man to the moon.

2. Her and Margaret Were Party Animals
At least for one night, they were—the night the Second World War was ended on May 8, 1945. Margaret and Elizabeth snuck onto the streets in very slight disguise but still managed to go undetected to party and celebrate the war finally being over. They managed to make it to the center of London, party in the Ritz, and catch their parents appearing on the balcony from the crowd below during a night that Queen Elizabeth calls one of the most memorable nights in her life. Their infamous evening has even been adapted and dramatized in a movie called “A Royal Night Out.”

It's the latest country to expand into the area. 

The list of countries already in the region or building bases there include: Saudi Arabia, China, Israel, United Arab Emirates and the US.

The US and European Union maintain regular security patrols. 

But the Red Sea is also one of the world's busiest maritime gateways for transporting oil.   

So, why is there a sudden interest in the Red Sea region?

유엔군 사령부가 지난 13일 판문점 북한 군인 귀순 과정에 대한 조사 결과를 발표합니다.

논란의 중심이 됐던 CCTV와 열감시 장비 TOD 영상도 함께 공개됩니다.

현장 연결하겠습니다.

[채드 G 캐롤 / 유엔군 사령부 공보실장]
안녕하십니까. 저는 대한미군 UN군 사령부 채드 캐롤 대령입니다.

오늘 저희는 판문점 귀순 사건과 관련한 UN군 사령부의 입장을 발표하겠으며 공동경비구역을 통한 11월 13일 귀순 사건 관련한 CCTV 영상 일체를 공개할 예정입니다.

본 영상의 공개 목적은 해당 일자에 발생한 사건을 시각적으로 정확하게 보여주는 것에 있습니다. 모두 아시는 바와 같이 지난주 본 영상을 공개할 예정이었으나 추가적인 영상을 더 확보하여 최대한 사건을명확하게 하기 위해서 영상의 공개를 연기하였습니다.

본 영상 시청 완료 후 보도자료에 있는 링크를 통하여 영상을 다운받으실 수 있습니다. 오늘 여기서 질의응답은 받지 않겠으나 브리핑 후 추가적으로 질문을 받아 추후에 최대한 빨리 답변드릴 수 있도록 하겠습니다.

이해를 돕는 차원에서 설명을 드리면 본 영상은 다양한 각도에서 촬영한 CCTV 영상을 기반으로 제작되었습니다. 동시에 발생하는 상황을 보여드리기 위하여 때로는 2개의 영상이 같은 화면에 보여질 수 있습니다.

북한군 귀순자가 차량을 통해서 72시간 다리를 건너 접근하는 모습을 보실 수 있으며 공동경비구역 건물 주변에 차량이 박히는 모습을 볼 수 있습니다.

영상에서는 북한군의 대응을 볼 수 있으며 이후 군사분계선을 넘어 남쪽으로 도주하는 귀순자의 모습을 보실 수 있습니다. 마지막으로 응급처치를 위한 의무 후송을 위하여 JSA 경비대대 인원들이 귀순병사의 신병을 확보하는 영상 또한 보실 수 있습니다.

본 사건이 발생한 시각에는 남북 양측 모두 공동경비구역에 대한 투어는 진행되고 있지 않았음을 알려드립니다. 이제 영상을 보여드리며 각 화면에 대해서 제가 좀 더 자세히 설명해 드리겠습니다.

본 초기 화면에서는 북한 차량이 72시간다리로 향하는 모습을 보실 수 있습니다.

보시는 바와 같이 해당 차량은 상당히 빠른 속도로 이동하고 있으며 차량이 72시간 다리를 건너 이동함에 따라 주변 건물에서 일부 북한군 병사들이 뛰어나오는 모습을 보실 수 있습니다.

그리고 보시는 영상 왼쪽 하단의 시간을 보실 수 있습니다. 지금... (중략)

What's crackin Big Herc? Big fan of the show and I love what you're doing. I have 3 unconnected questions: 
1.) does the TV show ""Beyond Scared Straight"" accurately depict prison? Or is it a bunch of acting for views? 
2.) can you recall the oddest/craziest thing you've seen smuggled in prison? 
3.) how would a claustrophobe handle prison?

Sorry if some of those were asked already I haven't seen every video. Thanks 🤙🏼

Tune in to find out what Big Herc has to say about this!

Brenda is 60 years-old, she worked for 35 years, she is a college graduate, and she sleeps on the sidewalk of New York City. 

I was a little shocked when Brenda told me she sleeps right here on the streets of New York City. With all the people walking by and the noise, I cannot imagine finding comfort enough to close my eyes. But for Brenda, that's where she feels safe. 

When Brenda lived in San Diego, she was entering a bus, and the driver didn't see her got on. When the driver moved the door to take off, Brenda was knocked to the ground. Then when the driver pulled away, her leg slammed into the steel door. 

Brenda was seriously injured. An ambulance took her to the hospital, but the accident was not reported with the proper protocol. Brenda then started legal proceedings and filed a lawsuit. The lawyer that was recommended to her wasn't honest, and the case never went anywhere. The judge dismissed the case and told Brenda she has every right to sue, but she would have to start all over again. 

Brenda now receives $720 a month from Social Security, and that's not even close to enough to afford a place to stay. 

At 9:26 I ask Brenda what she would want people to know about homelessness. She shares about how people are judgmental even about her wearing lipstick. Whenever I post a video with a woman that is trying to take care of herself by wearing makeup, lots of people freak out. They have a hard time understanding that homeless women still have the self-worth and decency to look presentable. 

Most people that are experiencing homelessness do not look homeless. There is little to no education focused on teaching the general public the true realities of homelessness so people hold on to a lot of misconceptions.

About Invisible People: 

Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they’re on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can’t ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation’s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.

¡Taylor Swift y Camila Cabello Arrasan En Los Billboard Music Awards 2018!
Camila Cabello impactó presentando su nuevo tema con Pharell, y Taylor Swift por primera vez en dos años regresa a unos premios.

Todos sabemos que estas dos son mejores amigas y así lo demostraron en los Bilboard Music Awards en Las Vegas.

Los Swifties quedaron impactados que Taylor aceptó ir a los Billboard Music Awards ya que no se lo esperaban. 
La estrella acaba de tener 2 conciertos sold-out en la ciudad de Pasadena, cerca de Los Ángeles donde su otra amiga del alma Selena Gomez llegó como invitada especial. 
Ha sido toda una semana de triunfos para T-Swift, ella terminó por llevarse a casita dos premios, el primero a ‘Artista Femenina del año’.
Se vale decir que su discursos de aceptación fueron el que se robaron el show. La reina de las serpientes quien hace un par de semanas despegó con su gira Reputation, con Charli XCX y Camila Cabello comenzó agradeciendo a sus compañeras de gira. Cami tuvo la mejor reacción cuando la nombro, tanto que nos sacó risas. 
Taylor siguió agradeciendo a todas las artistas femeninas que han abierto el camino para que todas las demás  puedan hacer lo que hacen…
Y bueno después Tay ganó el premio por el disco más vendido, donde ella habló de como comenzó a componer canciones a la edad de 12 años. Ella dijo, “Comencé a componer porque me hacía sentir comprendida. Cuando estaba creando Reputation, este álbum, sentía que muchos no me comprendían. Así que quiero agradecer a los fans por seguir llegando a los conciertos, despegamos de gira y la manera que me han tratado y me han entendido, muchas gracias por hacerme sentir comprendida una vez más.”

Feliciten a Tay Tay por su triunfos. Y bueno, Camila Cabello no se pudo quedar atrás. La estrella de Havana primero estreno su tema con Pharell “Sangria Wine” con una escenografía que para que les cuento…
Lo impactante de todo es que cuando terminó de cantar, comenzó con una coreografía prendidísima para después cantar una nueva versión de Havana.
Chicos, todos los artistas se sabían la canción! Fue impresionante y lo mejor de todo es que cantoo 100% en vivo. Un aplauso para Cami.

About We Bare Bears: 
Cartoon Network’s We Bare Bears is a new animated comedy about three brothers trying to fit in and make friends...which can be kinda hard to do when you’re a bear.  Grizzly is the oldest bear, and leads his brothers with bounds of optimism...that will only turn out disastrous some of the time.  Panda is a classic middle child – shy, sensitive, a little finicky – and a lovable, hopeless romantic.  Ice Bear is the youngest brother, an oddball personality and general wild card who enjoys flying under everyone’s radar.

Take everything I say as pure entertainment value only. Do not take any financial advice from me at all. I am not a financial advisor, I am only documenting my crypto journey for others to watch. With every investment platform, altcoin or program there are a lot of risks. Know what you're getting into and do your own research first!

Please understand that leverage trading is very risky and around 70% of people who leverage trade over a period of time may lose money. Keep this in mind and aim to learn the right techniques and trading style before jumping in blind.

Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are still reeling from the events of Avengers: Infinity War. Its cataclysmic climax instantly reshaped the landscape of the decade-old franchise, and left countless questions about how Earth's Mightiest Heroes can possibly go on. Fortunately, mere days after Infinity War's theatrical premiere, Marvel has come to our emotional rescue with some sorely needed, lighthearted adventure in the form of Ant-Man and the Wasp.  The story might be much smaller in scale, but it still promises to be jam-packed with action and adventure. While the trailer is full of big can't-miss moments … like a size-shifting car chase and a...giant ant playing the drums? … it's also got some teeny-tiny subtle things you might have missed.

Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres in 3D March 9th!
From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.

Lyrics:

Raining in Kyoto, it’s flooding the streets. I’m nursing a coffee from a vending machine. 
Saw the god of rice and a fox with a key. Woke up blind with a headache, grinding my teeth. 
Confused and alone, been taking pills to sleep. They soften your absence but they don’t let me dream. 

Raining in Kyoto. My breath turns into steam. I bought you a candle, not even sure what it means, but I cursed at the matches, and drown in my grief. An older man stood closeby and smiled at me. I rung the bell like he did and I told you I’m sorry. A makeshift funeral. I tried setting you free.

You’re half asleep,
I bought you a radio to drown out the machines.
Hospital light, 
you asked about the weather, wished that they’d let you outside.

Raining in Kyoto. I’m starting to shake. They’ll hold your service tomorrow. I’m an ocean away. 
Reached into my pocket, found a small paper crane. It’s been over a year now. April fades into May and I’ve barely stopped moving, I’ve been so fucking afraid; too much of a coward to even visit your grave.

You’re half awake, 
I bought you a radio to play the blues away.
With my hand to hold,

The Punisher is a third-person shooter video game developed by Volition and released by THQ in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Microsoft Windows; a mobile phone game was also developed by Amplified Games. The game stars the Marvel Comics antihero, The Punisher. After his family was murdered by the Mafia, Frank Castle devoted his life to the punishment of criminals. Players take control of the titular ruthless vigilante to track down criminals and kill them.

The game's story is a loose mixture of the 2004 film, as well as the Vol. 4 (2000) and Vol. 5 (2001) of the comic books. Actor Thomas Jane reprises his role as Frank Castle/The Punisher. The game features many cameo appearances from Marvel Comics characters, such as Iron Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Matt Murdock (the alter ego of Daredevil), Bushwacker, The Kingpin and Bullseye. Also present are several characters from the Welcome Back, Frank storyline such as detectives Martin Soap and Molly Van Richtofen, the Punisher's neighbors Joan and Spacker Dave, Ma Gnucci, The Russian and General Kreigkopf.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zyUwCNy6X8E/sddefault.jpg,0.024209791829689624,0.00037571788953894047,64.43609022556392,0.0032345637858803523,0.024585509719228564,0.027820073505108917,2018-02-03,15:34:30,Saturday,5,5,60,5,44,33,484,1,88,0,0,4,0,1,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.565102546437782,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

How to change your Facebook newsfeed settings 

Hi Paul here from PRwilson Media. Now our Facebook news feed. Where we get all the updates from friends, from pages we are following. We spend a lot of time there so it makes sense to get it set up so that you get the information you really want to see. So that's the Facebook newsfeed preferences. And I'll show you how to set those in this video. Here we go. 

So Facebook have made it really straightforward. You log in as your user profile and then you click here and you select newsfeed preferences. And you've basically got these 4 main categories plus some other options. First one to look at is prioritize who to see first. You can choose who's posts you don't want to miss then you'll get them at the very top of your newsfeed. So everytime they post you'll essentially see something from particular people. So I'm going to choose a few here.

Those ones with the stars are the ones that I've got prioritized currently. Just click and you can prioritize any additional ones. And then when you are ready just click done. Second one, unfollow people to hide their posts. 

So you don't want to unfriend people necesarily but it's an easy option to just say unfollow. They don't know that you are not seeing any posts from them , so nobody gets upset and you get the information you want to see. So you can go through people you are definitely following currently and I'll select a couple there. 

And that's even my own group that I run I can unfollow as well. So the next one - reconnect with people you unfollowed. So you give them another chance. If you haven't heard from them in a while if you want to get back in  touch you can reconnect with some people. 

And you'll see in a couple of other videos you can snooze people's updates for a few days. There's all sorts of flexible options here - let's just select a couple of other people and then click done. 

And finally discover pages that match your interest. Based on the kinds of topics that you have liked already it will suggest some other pages that might be of interest .

So if I do stuff locally with businesses in Lincoln that might be one to look at .It also shows what other friends like , which could be good clues.

Those are the four basic options. And the final one is see more options - so I need to scroll down a little more.  In this case it's just a couple of apps that people have suggested that I've hidden so I don't see updates from people about these particular topics. 

IF I want to change that I could say show. But I don't so that's it. Those are your news feed prefrerences  Do take the time to have a look through make sure you are getting te best vvalue out of your Facebook experience. 

So that's it from me, I'm Paul from PRwilson Media your social media personal trainer. Cheers.

Li Lianjie is one of the most well known faces in martial arts movies, but you probably know him better as Jet Li . From martial arts movies in the '80s and '90s up to modern-day franchises like The Expendables, Li has been an action star for as long as many moviegoers can remember. But fans were sent into a frenzy after a 2018 photo of the actor appearing aged beyond his years went viral. The snapshot was almost unrecognizable as the great martial arts star. Born in 1963, the martial artist would have just turned 55 at the time the buzzworthy picture was posted, but many thought he appeared to be 20 or 30 years older. People made their concerns known all around the world, but is there really any reason to worry? Here are the real reasons why Jet Li looks completely different now...

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zzCQbYn4U74/sddefault.jpg,0.011991659110050512,0.00034520878457016074,34.73741007194245,0.00046286537571412737,0.012336867894620672,0.0127997332703348,2018-03-07,06:52:43,Wednesday,2,7,43,7,38,44,367,0,85,1,1,6,16,1,0,5.0,8.0,['SUL i'],"['SUL', 'i']",True,"['sul', 'i']",2,2,4,0,0,0,1,6.414329770118396,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

Too many diamonds on can't mosh pit

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
They ain't sayin' shit — spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soo...",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zzU2fmX47ZY/sddefault.jpg,0.0069377651707466575,0.0004910049398817084,14.129725807683494,0.0001547679971657993,0.007428770110628367,0.007583538107794166,2018-01-24,19:54:12,Wednesday,2,16,78,16,37,95,535,8,82,3,0,11,23,0,0,5.0,6.0,['-'],['-'],True,['-'],1,1,1,1,0,0,0,6.063419200289093,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1
