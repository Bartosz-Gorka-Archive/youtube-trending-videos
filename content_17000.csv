LOOΠΔ [Yves]

Moving on through LOOΠΔ 1/3 and LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE, LOOΠΔ has taken roots into its unique Loonaverse.

Each member gathered to form a unit which became not just a collaboration, but a complete group with distinct musical style.

LOOΠΔ 1/3 sang about the thrill of first love and the sorrow of heartbreak. LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE took the fans by surprise with their odd view of the world.

In the process, LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE has placed themselves among the names in the iTunes charts worldwide, and in the Billboard top world albums chart, mix and matching to write their own organic story.

Now, LOOΠΔ takes another step with the introduction of Yves to start building its last four-member squad.

Yves asks a question in Eden. “Is it really a bad thing to disobey God?” If someone has already decided our fate, wouldn’t it be a better life to stand up and against that fate?

Even if it’s not something grand such as God or fate, Yves sings that she will not surrender herself to any walls or glass ceilings she may have to face.

The title track “new” is a song where Yves declares that she will be herself no matter what kind of hardships, pain, and frustration faces her. It is the first track released in the genre of Soultronica in Korea, with Yves’ confident voice laid on top of bold beats to prove LOOΠΔ’s new concept and quality.

The music video for “new” was directed by DigiPedi. He captures fatal images of Yves, who takes a bite of the apple on purpose to be exiled to the earth.

The supporting track “D-1” is a French-pop style track with trivial emotions and stories of a girl told in a classy way.

Just as ‘Love & Live’, ‘Love & Evil’, ‘Mix & Match’, and ‘Max & Match’ have, LOOΠΔ shuffles and swaps words to toughen its Mobius strip to become one.

We made it through the famous Corinth Canal - Greece. The canal is 8m deep and excavated at sea level so it doesn’t need any locks. It took them 12 years to make it and it was first opened in 1893. The canal shaves off a 700km journey around the Peloponnese peninsula and around 11,000 ships pass through each year, mostly small vessels that can handle the narrowness and are able to dodge the result of landslides the sit under the surface. Join us on La Vagabonde as we cruise right on through with my pal Kayla and of course Daniel usually hiding somewhere behind the scenes. Videos made with love, SLV xo

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

Lyrics:

Who's the victim now?
Stand up and take a bow, a bow
Face right, face left
Face everyone you disrespect

So who's the asshole now?
Holier-than-thou, you're not
'Cause baby's got a black soul, got a black soul
Got a bla-ack soul

You made a mess of your life
And you've been burned once or twice
Now you play roulette with a water gun

Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Erupt
It's better late than never
And it might take forever
To put you back together

Face right, face left
Face everyone you disrespect

Now they're on their feet
To watch you double down hard, and take it too far
And you know you're in too deep
'Cause you're running out of time and you're talking in your sleep
Baby's got a black soul
Baby's got no control
Baby's got a black soul, got a black soul
Got a bla-ack soul

You made a mess of your life
And you've been buried alive
Now you play roulette with a water gun

Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Erupt
It's better late than never
And it might take forever
To put you back together

Oh oh, oh oh

Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Erupt
It's better late than never
And it might take forever
Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Erupt
It's better late than never
And it might take forever
To put you back together

There are two basic kinds of Lithium Ion batteries, the round tube shapped batteries that weve seen inside of the other thick powerbanks ive taken apart, OR the super thin pouch styple batteries we see inside of cell phones.
The Crave Powerbank (on Amazon HERE: http://bit.ly/TypeCPowerBank) has some of the biggeset pouch style lithium ion batteries that Ive seen. Adding up to a 10,000 mAh capacity that can charge up your cell phone multiple times. 

Lithium can be found inside igneous rocks, but is more commonly found in HUGE brine pools, like the ones I showed in this video. The cool pastel colored lithium looks amazing from the sky. Someday I want to go film the mining process.  But today we'll have to stick with taking the batteries and powerbanks apart.

This part of our New Japan Explained series looks at Wrestle Kingdom 12 and the importance of the event.

New Japan has grown over the last twelve months since WrestleKingdom 11 and now the fruits of all that labor will be realized. Tetsuya Naito looks to avenge his five year humiliation in the main event against the longest reigning IWGP World Champion in history Kazuchika Okada. Kenny Omega and Chris Jericho battle in a cross-promotional match labeled Alpha vs. Omega in a no disqualification brawl. Jay White returns from excursion to challenge Hiroshi Tanhahashi for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.

With tons of other matches on the card, it is the second biggest pro wrestling pay per view of the year and will be the start of a new era in NJPW.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

- Origins Original Skin Pore Perfecting Cooling Primer with Willowherb
http://bit.ly/2BQFito
I still like this primer, it's skin smoothing, porefilling, and refreshing. My makeup goes nicely overtop as well.

- Tarte Shape Tape MATTE Foundation
http://bit.ly/2DXGUHJ
I dont like how DRY my skin looked with this foundation... and I have oily-combination skin so that's not normal. If you already have dry skin this is not the foundation for you. Also, it looked terrible on my acne. However, it WAS long lasting and like impossible to completely remove with only one wash. Not sure that I'm a fan but will continue to try and make it work by prepping my skin with extra hydrating primer, exfoliating, ect. but you shouldnt have to work that hard to make the foundation work.

- Tarte Shape Tape HYDRATING Foundation
http://bit.ly/2E0p0E7
This only lasted a few hours wear before getting too oily on my skin but that's because it's a hydrating foundation and I have oily skin to begin with. I did like how it evened out my skin tone and looked very natural. I just had to use concealer to add more coverage to my blemishes to fully cover them up. If you like the ""no makeup look"" and wear bb creams, you'll like this one.

- BECCA Under Eye Brightening Setting Powder:
http://bit.ly/2EzA9sA
This powder had flashback directly after applying but after setting my face with a spray and it had time to settle into my skin, it was great. I do worry that this powder would be a little ashy on deeper skin tones however because of the reflecting pearls. 

- Urban Decay All Nighter Pollutant Protectant Setting Spray
http://bit.ly/2DWJq0F
This locks in makeup but doesnt melt powders into a skin-like finish as MAC Fix + does. I also cant tell if it has worked at protecting my skin against environmental pollutants since that's hard to judge after only a few uses.

- Tarte Park Ave Princess Amazonian Clay Waterproof Bronzer
http://bit.ly/2EBfnJ5
love this right now, it's my go-to bronzer but it will only work for similar skintones to mine. 

EYEBROWS
- Benefit Cosmetics ""Precisely, My Brow Pencil"" 2
http://bit.ly/2DZqU8h
- Benefit Cosmetics ""Gimme Brow: light""
http://bit.ly/2EBilgY

EYES
- Tarte Shape Tape Eye Primer 
http://bit.ly/2nDDv5T
I wasnt a fan of this one because of how sticky it was and sheer. I like a full coverage, thick eyeshadow primer like mac soft ochre paint pot

- Dominique Cosmetics ""The Latte Palette"" 
http://bit.ly/2DVq5Jf
LOVE THIS 

- NUDESTIX Rock N' Roller Easy Eyeliner Ink
http://bit.ly/2nDFcQN
wont be switching to this kind of eyeliner anytime soon but it's an interesting idea you could get good at with practice. If you like a shiny black liner and you get used to the weird wheel applicator, you might like this one. 

- Diorshow Pump N Volume Squeezable Mascara
http://bit.ly/2FF88PQ
very thick, can sometimes look ""clumpy"" but i like my lashes thick so i didnt mind this one. However it does feel quite heavy on your lashes, it also takes a while to dry so it's easy to smudge it around your eye.

- Ardell Faux Mink 811 Lashes
http://bit.ly/2nGfmvg
love these lashes, very great dupes for expensive mink lashes

LIPS
- FENTY BEAUTY by Rihanna Mattemoiselle Plush Matte Lipstick S1ngle
http://bit.ly/2nAEbK3
love this!! so pigmented, comfortable, and lasted ALL DAY. Really a fan of these matte lipsticks, just want more nude/wearable shades.

APPLICATION TOOLS
- Tarte Shaper Sponge 
http://bit.ly/2E0p0E7
this wont be replacing my beauty blender but it's decent

- Tarte Paddle to Perfection foundation brush

************************************************ 

So, I was supposed to post this yesterday but can we just blame it on a “bad April fools joke” and NOT because Easter plans got in the way??? THANKS!!!!! 

so this video is totally different than my usuals, but I wanted to make something different and sort of funny just to show my full appreciation to every single one of you that has subscribed and supported as of late. I don’t act like it in this video but you have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for a following and I cannot WAIT to make cartoons for you!!! Hopefully you’re into this Doodle Diary thing but next video will be my usual “secretly record and make fun of the family I love” content, don’t worry ;)

Let me know what you think of this though and feel free to shoot me any questions. It really might end up turning into a cartoon, who knows...

What should you expect to see if you visit someone? What will you see on your first day as a medical student or resident? 

This video shows you want to expect so that you won't be as nervous or shocked when you arrive. The ICU can be a difficult place to visit, because it often means someone you care about is quite sick. Just know that there are so many people who are happy to answer questions and try to make the experience better for you.

Lyrics:
Every little part of me, is holding on to 
Every little piece of you, is holding on to 
Every drop of blood you drew
Is holding on to you 

Every waking hour I spend, holding out for
Reasons not to go to bed, I’m holding out for 
Someone else to hold instead 
If every hope of you is dead 

Cause every night, since you cut and run 
I feel like the only one 
Who’s ever been the lonely one
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking 
With every step that you’re taking 

Cause you been running circles round 
My mind, turning me inside out 
And I fell for you, but hit the ground 
Cause the only love I’ve known has let me 
Down, and I need lifting up 
Now you ain’t here I’m sleeping rough
And I’m praying I can pray enough 
So waking up without you ain’t so tough 

Find it hard to find my feet 
when I keep on stumbling over you and me 
But I keep on trying cause I know I need 
To outrun the memories 

And every day I’m reminded of
The way I let it come undone 
And I feel like the lonely one, the only one 
With time worth wasting 
Well I still can’t stop chasing 

Cause you been running circles round 
My mind, turning me inside out 
And I fell for you, but hit the ground 
Cause the only love I’ve known has let me 
Down, and I need lifting up 
Now you ain’t here I’m sleeping rough
And I’m praying I can pray enough 
So waking up without you ain’t so tough
Tough 
Tough 
So waking up without you

Say I 
Thought I was talking to you 
Say I 
I guess I’m talking to myself 
Me and nobody else

Iraqi forces began their campaign to crush ISIS in October 2016 just outside of Erbil, with a coalition of Kurdish peshmerga forces, and Western advisory allies. It was a long and arduous process of slowly advancing first from town to town along the Nineveh plains toward the city and then from block to block as they worked to liberate sectors of the city.

woooooooow
Frank and Amy... relationship goals. 
i didn't expect to fall in love with a couple from Black Mirror since this show (which is genious) is not about love though. 
These two were a total suprisingly adorable new year gift for me yes. Black Mirror fed shippers sooooooo well this year. ugh blessed.

i love the idea of finding your ultimate match by rebelling against the system which you obviously are not allowed or it could be dangerous/unknown and they choose it anyway just to be together for 998 times awwwwwwww. that's what love is.

also don't get me started on the hand thing portrayed as more intimate than having sex. it's like when you hold someone's hand you know if they are the ones for you or not. 


if you haven't seen Hang the DJ , just go for it asap. It's the best thing i've seen in a while! 
I love love love Black Mirror, every episode is a masterpiece but this one is my fav of all time.

Since her shocking exit from The Today Show in 2012, former co-anchor Ann Curry has been keeping a relatively low profile.  In the wake of Matt Lauer's disgraced departure from the show, though, people are starting to wonder whether Curry might still be available to co-anchor the popular morning program again in his stead.  However, there's plenty of reason to believe that might not be in Curry's best interest right now because, although she's been quiet in recent years, she's still been working towards her own personal and professional passions…

He didn't like what JJ Abrams did with Luke Skywalker in The Force Awakens, and especially hated Rian Johnson's direction of Luke in The Last Jedi. Then during the movie's marketing campaign, he was contractually obligated to keep quiet of his true feelings towards the movie. However, now with that all over and Disney/Lucasfilm now focusing all their efforts into SOLO, Mark Hamill has no more reason to keep his true feelings, and future with the series a secret.

BUMBUM DE OURO
Autores: Gloria Groove, Pablo Bispo, Sergio Santos e Ruxell

Letra:
Essa mina é um tesouro
Bumbum de ouro
18 quilates de bunda ela tem

Sabe que é um estouro
Já fez pegar fogo
Então bate que brilha
E se joga também

Vai ostentando
Toda essa riqueza
Joga na malicia
Joga com delicadeza

Sente o movimento
Vai devagar
Prepara menina
É sua vez de brilhar

Ela bate o bumbum no bumbo
Quando o bumbo bater pro bumbum

Olha como reluz
Brilho que te seduz
Ofusca feito sol
Essa bunda tem muita luz

Ó o tamanho desse rabo
De ouro é banhado
Popô que é lendário
É o famoso el dorado

Ela é bunda da riqueza
Beleza, é globeleza
Ostenta sua fortuna
Quando bate sua bunda

E desce devagar
Rebola sem parar
Ela é bumbum de ouro
Tesouro, insha`allah

◅ On our channel we create а trailer mashups ▻
also known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.

The trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.

Hundreds of guests watched the couple exchange vows in a ceremony featuring a gospel choir and an American preacher.  And the #kiss the #RoyalWedding crowds had waited for.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been declared husband and wife, following a ceremony at Windsor Castle. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel.

Following their marriage, the couple will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

At Chengdu Panda Base in China, scientists are dedicated to protecting the species by breeding adult Giant Pandas in order to introduce cubs into the wild.  This film follows one such researcher, whose passion leads her to initiate a new technique inspired by a black bear program in rural New Hampshire.  What starts as a cross-culture collaboration becomes a life-changing journey for an American biologist who crosses an ocean to join her; a scientist from Inner Mongolia; and a very curious female cub named Qian Qian, born in captivity.

 Captured with IMAX® Cameras, join Qian Qian on an exciting new adventure in the mountains of Sichuan as she takes her first steps outside her protected habitat, discovering her true animal nature…even as she faces the challenges of the unknown.

David Douglas and Drew Fellman, the filmmakers behind “Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar,” directed the film, which Fellman wrote and produced, with Douglas as director of photography.  Donald Kushner and Steve Ransohoff also produced the film, with Li Gen Xiong and Elie Samaha executive producing and Neal Allen serving as line producer.

“Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar” editor Beth Spiegel and composer Mark Mothersbaugh collaborated with Douglas and Fellman once again, with sound design by Gus Koven.
IMAX Entertainment presents, in association with IMAX Documentary Films Capital and Panda Productions, “Pandas.”   The film will be released in select IMAX® and IMAX® 3D theaters starting April 6, 2018.

Vox Borders Episodes:
1. Haiti and the Dominican Republic ( https://youtu.be/4WvKeYuwifc)
2. The Arctic & Russia (https://youtu.be/Wx_2SVm9Jgo)
3. Japan & North Korea (https://youtu.be/qBfyIQbxXPs)
4. Mexico & Guatemala (https://youtu.be/1xbt0ACMbiA)
5. Nepal & The Himalaya (https://youtu.be/ECch2g1_6PQ)
6. Spain & Morocco (https://youtu.be/LY_Yiu2U2Ts)

The sixth and last Vox Borders episode deals with a border between Morocco and Spain. The journey to asylum is never easy. And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.

So undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles. And it's a tall one.

The plaster spider-man head in the beginning of the video is 3D scanned, then the shape is duplicated in the form of a face shell design. The face shell is 3D printed at shapeways.com. You can get your own in my shop on:
http://www.shapeways.com/shops/spideyplanet

The spiderman fabric is printed digitally and the colors are enriched after with fabric dye. The webs are CNC milled and casted from urethane. The sides of the spiderman webs are painted dark gray afterwards.

The webs are glued onto the fabric using Loctite 4861, which is a flexible super glue. The strip that goes on the inside of the face shell is used to keep the fabric in place. It is simply cut from foam rubber and provided with double sided carpet tape.

How has this first week been for you? It is officially a week today that we moved out of the dorm and are settling in to a new apartment. Things have been hectic, as we rush to set as much as possible up everyday. I tried to rush because we wanted to bring home our kitty as soon as possible, she was waiting for us at the pound for almost 2 weeks.

And today things are starting to fall into place! Couple nights ago, we finally got a proper bed set up. No more sleeping on the floor. Our new furry friend is living with us now, and she is the sweetest. She will hopefully be in the next vlog! (btw, the next vlog is gonna be a rough one. pretty choppy with footage that is all over the place). That was the best I could do with the busy moving going on.

I have been so fatigued as a result. We sleep around 1-2am each night and get up at 8... starting to feel a little sick with sneezing or coughing up phlegm. so it needs to be brought to attention that I should get proper sleep and eat at regular times. (dinner has been 9-10pm for me each night too, from being so busy with setting up the place). No excuses! Just more effort needed!

So lucky to have all of these things, even though it seems stressful. It is a blessing, I make sure to count all of mine everyday. Thank you so much for being here. Even when i am so busy, I always can't wait until I can sit back down and make content. It is a gift to have you on the other end to watch it. Grateful for our kind and positive community.

Hope you enjoyed following me through finals week, and I wish you a happy summer. Whether you already are out of school, or have the tough finals in the coming week, I hope you take care of yourself. I understand sometimes that in the moment, we need to make sacrifices now and then. Even I did that for a week. But there is always a line to draw, ok! In a few decades, the wear and tear from our youths will emerge. Take care of yourself now, for yourself later. I will see you soon!!!

Sending you love,
Annabelle

p.s. should I make a haul with the home goods that I purchased? I got a lot of organizational products from savers, ikea, etc to set up my place. wonder if you are interested? let me know!

[ MAMAMOO(마마무) ]

MAMAMOO surprisingly released ‘Everyday’ that is known as the ultimate chemistry song. MAMAMOO proved its potential as ‘reliable MAMAMOO’ by sweeping all the music charts and eight prizes of music programs with its title track ‘Starry Night’ with its sixth album ‘Yellow Flower’. After successfully completing this album for too short time, MAMAMOO came back as a surprise gift to the sad fans to show their own colorful charms again.

It was an epic, offensive explosion where Nick Foles threw for 373 yards, 3 TDs and both teams combined for the greatest number of yards in a single game. In this film breakdown, I looked at Nick Foles and Doug Pedersons' offense to see the keys of their victory.

Part of the reason Marvel movies work so well is that their visual effects are so seamless that we can rarely tell the difference between the parts of a scene that are real, and those that have been digitally enhanced. But looking at the behind-the-scenes action for each movie, it becomes clear just how differently the MCU might look if not for the talented artists who turn each shot into stunning and impossible action fare. Here's a look at how some of your favorite Marvel movies would have looked without the magic of special effects...

We're so sad that this amazing dream trip is coming to an end. We had so much fun checking out the Japanese malls and arcades! We tried so hard to win that claw machine game. We had a blast seeing what all the vending machines and little toy machines and gashapon had in them! We even got a couple for a giveaway, so stay tuned for that! Then we looked at some retro toy stores and headed out into the rainy city to try to find some food. We ended up in a little ramen place where we ordered our dinner at a machine and ate in a small 4 table restaurant. We had a bit of a fail with the ramen, we accidentally ordered a fish based ramen so we split the other ramen and tried a sushi place in the train station afterwards that was awesome! We had a great last night in Tokyo and we're super thankful for our friend Josh who met up with us and gave us all the grand tour! Thank you for following along and joining in on our adventure! We'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

Here is what you'll need!

6 Weird Things You Didn't Know Could Help You In The Kitchen

Dental Floss
Use dental floss to cut a cake for a super fine clean cut.

Clothing Pin
Save burning your hands and use a clothing peg to pull out the hot tray in an oven or toaster oven. Glue a small magnet to the side of a clothing pin. Glue a small magnet to the side of the peg so it can stick to your toaster oven, for quick access.

Shower rod
Use a shower tension rod under your kitchen sink to hang paper towels, gloves, spray bottles and the rest of your cleaning clutter.

Marbles
Pour marbles into a pie dish and place another one on top to create a lazy susan. Great for condiments and making room in small kitchen cupboards.

File Folders
File folders are a great organisational accessory to your kitchen. Use them to divide up fresh produce, store cans, or store your baking papers and cleaning products.

Wrapping paper
Organise your kitchen drawers by covering foam board in wrapping paper to create sectioned off areas.

Good cop, bad cop, vampire, punk rocker. it's quite the CV for Gary Oldman. For this list, we're counting down the finest movie moments from one of Britain's best and most celebrated actors.

En este vídeo, los dos cracks hablan de forma distendida sobre el fútbol, su futuro y la vida.
Iniesta y Buffon se han visto las caras en muchas ocasiones, pero el de este miércoles podría ser uno de los últimos partidos entre el azulgrana y el 'bianconeri'. El manchego lo ha ganado todo con el Barça y con la selección, mientras que el portero de la Juventus le falta la Liga de Campeones en su ancho palmarés individual y colectivo a sus 39 años. Por lo tanto, estamos hablando de dos futbolistas referentes a nivel mundial por la magia que nos ofrecen en cada partido.

ABOUT THE FOUR
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

As passionate fans of these shows, we provide news, analysis and fan engagement on America’s Got Talent, Britain’s Got Talent, The Voice, The X Factor, American Idol, The Four and its contestants.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So, you've taken it all from me
Will you sell me back my world and leave me be?
Strange, this is where we are
You have taught me how to live under the scars

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you thought that I would lose my reflection in the sea you let me drown
But I can swim without you now

[Chorus]
I don't need all the things that you promised to give me
You can keep your broken flowers and the sorry that they came with
'Cause the bad got me good, now I'm stronger without you
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me

[Verse 2]
Wait, before you crawl to me
Don't forget the memories were bittersweet
Now, now that I've let you go
I can kill the ghost of you and [?] my head

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you thought that I would lose my reflection in the sea you let me drown
But I can swim without you now

[Chorus]
I don't need all the things that you promised to give me
You can keep your broken flowers and the sorry that they came with
'Cause the bad got me good, now I'm stronger without you
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me

[Bridge]
(Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy)

[Chorus]
I don't need all the things that you promised to give me
You can keep your broken flowers and the sorry that they came with
'Cause the bad got me good, now I'm stronger without you
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me

But what kind of game is Fallout 76? Where does it take place? And what's this about online multiplayer? Discover the Fallout 76 theories doing the rounds, and our hopes for the new Fallout, and subscribe for more on Fallout 76 very soon. 

The star of the Fallout 76 trailer is Vault 76 itself, a new and hitherto unvisited Vault in the Fallout universe, though among other things we can we glean from the Fallout 76 teaser trailer is the potential setting of post-apocalyptic West Virginia. 

Marry the hints from the trailer to the rumours swirling online about Fallout 76 being an online survival game, and it's starting to look like a pretty novel Fallout experience indeed. Thoughts? Let us know them in the comments.

I'm confused about how to be an American right now. There are days when I don't have a lot of hope. That's especially true because of how deeply divided our country feels right now, and also because of the erosion of faith in government, the media, social services, and the FBI.

But I also worry about the loss of faith in the legal system, the military, and law enforcement. These things need to be fixed, and thus they need to be criticized...but at a certain point, that criticism basically becomes calls for revolution or abolition of the systems that have created a prosperous and stable society for many (though, clearly not all) people.

Thanks for watching this long video, I feel very lucky to have been able to make it.

Lyrics:

Just like in the movies
It starts to rain
We're the broken beauties
Blindfolded minds collide and we fall

When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our stories after the end

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I
Strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Memories in photos
Too easy to rewrite
Left us lonely shadows
Holding each other tight and we fall

When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our stories after the end

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Think we got it but we're made of a dream
Cause we've got a feeling of what we could be
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it but we're made of a dream
Cause we've got a feeling of what we could be
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I
Strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Think we got it but we're made of a dream
Cause we've got a feeling of what we could be
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it but we're made of a dream
Cause we've got a feeling of what we could be
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone

It was a friendly scrim, In the beginning I was pretty rough but as I adapted to the gamemode and the communication got better, I adapted and so did everyone else because this PVP with NO HUD is INTENSE. Everyone in the lobby had a lot of fun and I HIGHLY encourage you guys to try this out yourselves if you have a group of friends to play with. Shoutout to Sodith, Finest, Huncho, Fade, Golden, and 420 for playing in the little friendly scrim. Hope you guys enjoy!

The transition between a proper Squash pose to a Stretch pose, or the other way around, breaks the perfect solidity that CG animation in particular inherently gives to everything.

The one and only Toni Braxton releases her eighth studio album Sex & Cigarettes today, full of huge hooks and gripping stories from an incredible career at the pinnacle of R&B. Everyone knows her name, everyone knows her voice. You've probably drunkenly sang 'Un-break My Heart' in some karaoke bar at 3am at least once, too. But did you know she once lived in a haunted house?

We loved the book series and Netflix’s adaptation has done a pretty good job in keeping with the source material! However, here are the top 10 differences between the books and the Netflix series! For one, The Miserable Mill’s backstory. In the fourth novel of this most unfortunate series, little is learned about the Lucky Smells Lumbermill. The show offers more backstory, as the Baudelaire’s parents are implicated in a fire that scorched the town. Sir and Charles’ Partnership is also adapted differently. Find out more in the video!

The billionaire Chinese property tycoon has been waging a media war against his homeland’s government. Guo says he’s trying to stamp out corruption and graft, but China accuses him of the very same thing.

Since January, Guo has taken to YouTube and Twitter making corruption allegations against top Chinese officials. Some of them have been disproven, some can’t be proven, but some have turned out to be accurate. Guo cites the retirement of China’s anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, as his most recent victory. Guo alleged Wang and his family made millions in mysterious business dealings. Wang did not respond to the allegations and was never investigated nor charged.

China issued an arrest warrant for Guo but does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S., which has shown no interest in detaining him. Guo, for his part, is hoping the U.S. will grant him asylum and says he can be of use to the Trump Administration. The White House hasn’t commented on Guo’s case but his position as a dissident who may have access to insider information may make him a useful bargaining chip.

You can only get this in Colombia, South America at the moment. So let me enjoy it for you! :) Grab some food and eat with me and Orlin! Today we talk about lots of different things going on in our lives, going to the nearby immigration office to fax some papers, talking about vegans, veganism, and more. I hope you enjoy our car tour, too! :) If you love KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken, give this video a big thumbs up! Don't forget to leave a comment, too!

I have fire ants, black crazy ants, yellow crazy ants, polyrhachis ants, and Diacamma ants (bullet ants of Asia), but none have been able to pull off what these new ants joining our ant family did! They completely shocked me and I know they will shock you, too! Check out our brand new ant colony, which successfully pulled off a disappearing act on us! It reminded me that perhaps I, as the ant keeper, am not the one in complete control!

ABOUT RHOBH:
La La Land shines bright when Bravo Media's ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" returns for season eight. Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Lisa Vanderpump are joined by new housewife Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave and friend Camille Grammer for a season of lavish adventures, uncontrollable laugher and confrontations aplenty. Running her successful fitness and nutrition accountability business, newcomer Teddi moves through life with a strict ethos that she rarely strays from, even if this leads to differing opinions with some of the ladies. Friendly face Camille returns with a new outlook on life and is finally able to entertain the idea of remarrying, but when she struggles to get her ""sexy"" back, she turns to her friend Lisa Rinna for advice. This season, the ladies are busier than ever, juggling life at home and in the boardroom. In addition to wrapping production on her series ""American Woman"" and expanding her retail business, Kyle is at a crossroad when she has to decide whether to renovate or move out of the home where she's raised her daughters. Dorit gives herself just a couple months to re-launch her swimwear line, which proves to be a nearly impossible task. Erika pours herself into Erika Jayne's meteoric rise, back in the recording studio and opening up in shocking ways as she writes her autobiography. Meanwhile, Lisa Rinna is a focused ""momager"" to her two model daughters, who are poised to be the next ""it"" girls, but struggles to keep them grounded as they continue to travel the world and grow up very fast. Lisa Vanderpump is knee-deep in rescue dogs, as her new business, Vanderpump Dogs, continues to thrive, but will she be able to do it all once she also takes on editor of a magazine? From casual lunches to luxurious escapades, there's no doubt that living this large has its ups and downs, but these housewives have their famed zip code -- and then some -- in the palms of their hands.

What is this video about?
******************************************
This video represents an underwater experience full of animal life and corals made for Virtual Reality.

Educational information:
*************************
What is Virtual Reality? Virtual Reality is a medium with the ability to be transported to other places, to be fully immersed in experiences and to feel like you are really there. 
All you need is a Virtual Reality headset and a Virtual Reality video in 360° or 3D.

How was this video created?
*****************************
I recorded my gameplay experience of the VR game Ocean Descent by using a video capture card and edited the footage in Adobe Premiere to show you my favorite parts of my experience. You'll see exactly what I've seen. Enjoy ;)

The recorded in-game experience is pre-scripted by the developer. There could be similarities to other gameplay videos.

My workflow: Video recording in 3D side by side, editing, cutting and image enhancemenet in Adobe Premiere + video export in 4K UHD resolution.
Time effort: 2 hours

Elton John opened his Grammy performance in his classic style, sitting at the piano and wearing a bejeweled jacket and sunglasses.   

After singing a verse of the song solo, Elton introduced his duet-partner Miley Cyrus to the stage. Miley was all smiles in a stunning fuschia gown as she joined the icon for the rest of the song.

These two were so adorable together it was almost too much to handle. Miley turned up the Southern twang in her accent for her share of the vocals, which worked perfectly for the whimsical ballad. 

In addition to his performance with Miley at the Grammy awards, the Recording Academy is honoring the 50th anniversary of Elton John’s career with a tribute concert called “I’m Still Standing: A Grammy Salute” on Tuesday. Miley will also be performing at that show, in addition to Kesha, Miranda Lambert, John Legend, and others.

Elton recently announced that he’s retiring from music, confirming that his upcoming world tour will be his last. Hopefully this stunning performance will inspire Elton to collab on at least ONE single with Miley before he retires for good, because they are clearly a match made in music heaven.

So what did you think of Miley and Elton’s epic duet? And are you also you dying to see them collab on at least one track before Elton retires? Let me know in the comments below, and then click right here to see Kesha’s powerful performance of “Praying” from the show. kesha performs

Relaxing at the cabin with Cali, my Golden Retriever.  The weather was incredible, warm and sunny one day with deer coming out to dine on the acorns exposed by the melting snow, but the next day, rain ice pellets fell all night long before changing to snow the following day. It was not the worst ice storm I've witnessed, not like the ice storm of several years ago that shut the northeast down for a few days, but it did some damage.

With our drone, my wife got some incredible aerial footage and photographs of raging rivers, pristine Canadian wilderness in the snow and the log cabin.
The rustic tiny house is extremely cozy right now, especially when my wife and dog are there and the fire in the woodstove is burning, the candles and lanterns are lit and the furs are piled high on the bed.  It's extremely cozy now that the floor is insulated and the spaces between the logs have been filled. Woodworking and bushcrafting the structure was very rewarding, but the interior finishes are the icing on the cake. Whenever I'm inside with the fire burning and I look out through the windows and the winter storms raging, I'm inspired to finish the tiny log house as soon as possible so that I can get working on the front porch, the outdoor kitchen, the cellar, workshop, maple syrup shack and more. 
I'm particularly excited to live off the land, foraging for wild plants and edibles, growing my own vegetables and becoming self reliant. I can use this off grid cabin as a shelter and base where I can practice living off the land and use primitive technology, learn bushcraft skills, improve my survival skills and my self reliance.
Of course, no video would be complete without the meals that I prepare on the wood stove over the fire with cast iron cookware. In this episode, I make stewed venison spiced with garam masala, with leeks, onions and broccoli. For breakfast, I have fresh chicken eggs from the nearby rural homestead where they raise chickens and turkeys. I will be showing how I put the eggs in long term storage, preserving the food for the future.
My dog and I fall asleep to the hooting of barred owls, and the wind through the trees and the falling rain were a big ASMR triggers for me. It's deep winter outside, but in the cabin was cosy and warm. Sometimes I think living off grid in a tiny house seems much easier, away from the daily stress of life.
In fact, dealing with my high blood pressure and becoming much healthier is my motivation for building this cabin and living the simple life. Not my only motivation of course, I'm also inspired by my wife and my parents, who are living long and happy lives. Inspiration is important in this crazy world, and of course I'm not the only one who wants to escape from society and retreat to a cabin in the woods.
To accomplish my goal of living off grid with as little money as possible, living cheap and saving money wherever possible, I need to continue to hone my woodworking and bushcraft skills, along with tree identifications, foraging, making maple syrup, harvesting chaga, catching fish and game, preserving food for long term storage (dehydrating, salting, curing, smoking, freezing, drying).

About The Opposition w/ Jordan Klepper: 
In a TV news landscape where it’s impossible to know whom to trust, one man rises above the partisan hackery of the mainstream media to bring you the only truth that matters: his. From the fringe-friendly mind of Jordan Klepper, this is The Opposition.

THR has a new report about a test screening for ‘Deadpool 2’ that occurred in Dallas. The score coming out from the screening is a 98. This is the third test screening that’s reportedly occurred for this movie with 91 and 97 being the scores for the previous two screenings. The film completed 6 days of reshoots last month and reportedly shot two hours of footage in Los Angeles for a secret cameo that will be appearing in the film. The original ‘Deadpool’ scored a 91 and went on to gross $783 million worldwide so it would seem that the sequel is set up to be a box office success as well. This report also comes on the heels of the rumored negative test screening that supposedly occurred a couple of weeks ago and caused all sorts of online drama.

Perri Nemiroff and John Rocha sit down to discuss this news and explore what this new report might indicate about the movie. They also look at the need for test screenings and try to guess who the cameo in the film might be.

FURTHER READING

“‘What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.’ The Roman philosopher Seneca used to comfort his friends – and himself – with this darkly humourous remark which gets to the heart of Stoicism, the school of philosophy which Seneca helped to found and which dominated the West for two hundred years. We get weepy and furious, says Stoicism, not simply because our plans have failed, but because they have failed and we strongly expected them not to. Therefore, thought Seneca, the task of philosophy is to disappoint us gently before life has a chance to do so violently. The less we expect, the less we will suffer. Through the help of a consoling pessimism, we should strive to turn our rage and our tears into that far less volatile compound: sadness. Seneca was not trying to depress us, just to spare us the kind of hope that, when it fails, inspires bitterness and intemperate shouting.…”

The eggs belong to deep-sea skates, a relative of the shark. Scientists believe that skates are laying eggs on these vents for a reason. Hydrothermal vents are places where super-heated water erupts out of the sea floor, usually where tectonic plates meet. The water can exceed temperatures of 750° Fahrenheit, providing pockets of heat in an otherwise cold, deep-sea environment. In the cold waters of the deep sea, eggs take much longer to incubate. When eggs are placed near a hydrothermal vent, the heat speeds up the incubation process by months or years.

Party Like It's Your Birthday -- Lyrics

I better save my appetite
For all the cake I'mma eat tonight
Close your eyes and make a wish

Looking pretty by candlelight
Naughty minds they think alike
I got just the perfect gift

Celebration time is coming
New sensation ain't that something
It's that one thing
We all came for
Everyone they
They wanna be you

Let's party like it's your birthday
Party like it's your birthday
Come on and put your lips together, blow the candle out
Party like it's your birthday
Party like it's your birthday
I wanna make you feel real special, put your name in lights

We are gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Blow the candle out

We are gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Blow the candle out

All your dreams will come alive
You want the one to put in the time
Surely I've done something right?

Separated from the rest
I'd say you're better than the best
Night is yours and you are mine

*Updates ~ 
Mascara is a total DREAM!!! Didn't flake & wore beautifully all day ... was a pain to remove though.  
Foundation is something I'm continuing to reach for for quick natural makeup days, it's not as long wearing as I would like it to be, but it looks beautiful on the skin and it's quick to blend. 
Liner faded quite a bit, I won't be reaching for it anymore, but the shadows are 100% Tati approved.

Can you make it to Florida? Send us an email. Thanks so much for the support. After the tangled anchors drifting out to sea debacle last week we experienced last week, I sent everyone off to have some down time away from the boat. Daniel would go to Athens and then rendezvous with us in Malta, in particular though Elayna I thought needed a bit of a break. She and Kayla went to the island of Ios which is actually where Elayna and I met. It was a shame I couldn't get there myself but we still needed to get the boat back La Grande Motte before leaving the Mediterranean and I knew from previous experience how difficult it gets rushing from East to West in the Med late in the season. Winter Is Coming.
To be honest its the least I could do. If you guys could only see how much time and effort Elayna puts into just one episode you would fall off your chair. I can't edit movies like she can but I can sail a boat by myself to keep the team heading in the right direction.
I intended to sail solo from Greece to Malta but that was before I met Houmaid, one of the most interesting guys I've come across. After some provisioning and intense discussions about the weather, we set sail for Malta.

Another sign-language interpreter is accused of signing total gibberish. This time it was at the police news conference announcing an arrest in the Tampa serial killings. A woman standing off to the side was supposedly translating every word, but it turns out much of what she was signing was nonsense. The woman, identified as Derlyn Roberts, has a string of arrests for fraud.

Lyrics:

There’s a light on your skin
painted gold on your feet
If you’re gonna lean into me make sure you feel the heat
You can take what you want
but when you take it from me
I'll make sure that you fall upon the floor down to your knees

I’m not betting on a miracle, to give me peace
I’m not asking for a miracle, just you and me.

Yeah i wanna know… if you’re gonna be there
cus its hard to believe or see it yea yea , why do I get the feeling
Were getting close , but we’ll never be there.
cus its hard to believe or see it yea yea
is it more than a feeling

I wanna know (2)

Yeah i wanna know… if you’re gonna be there
cus its hard to believe or see it yea yea , why do I get the feeling
I wanna know

Cus its never a no
So what hand will you play
Is it to much to ask if I should go or I should stay
In a moment of doubt
put your hand on the flame
when you need to remind yourself that you could feel the same

I’m not betting on a miracle to give me peace
I’m not asking for a miracle, just you and me.

Yeah i wanna know… if you’re gonna be there
cus its hard to believe or see it yea yea , why do I get the feeling
Were getting close , but we’ll never be there
cus its hard to believe or see it yea yea
is it more than a feeling

I wanna know (2)
Yeah i wanna know… if you’re gonna be there

cus its hard to believe or see it yea yea, why do I get the feeling
I wanna know",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LwiOGuKEgkY/sddefault.jpg,0.01668291707122576,0.00026671982919044407,62.548469387755105,0.0006688407961586903,0.016949636900416204,0.017618477696574895,2018-05-30,13:59:55,Wednesday,2,11,96,11,35,57,536,4,88,2,1,8,1,1,9,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.881091798769137,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

When Isabelle Nagel-Brice decided to build a tiny home for herself, she realised that for the cost of two years rent in Colorado she would be able to pay for the materials to build her own tiny home on wheels.

Become a Living Big Patron: https://www.patreon.com/livingbig

The result of her efforts is an incredible green-built tiny home which has been constructed entirely of eco-friendly materials which can all be recycled or will bio degrade at the end of the buildings life. The home is designed to be off-the-grid, with solar panels soon to be added to her set-up and is packed full of reclaimed and healthy materials.

iMac Pro - http://amzn.to/2CzX6ya

2018. Apple releases their most expensive computer ever made with some of the best hardware on the market. The new iMac Pro comes loaded with the most powerful graphics and processors ever in a Mac. Everything looks great with the crisp 5K Retina display. Buyers get to choose to have 8, 10, 14 or even 18 cores with turbo boost speeds up to 4.5GHz. With 4 channels of memory that can support 128GB 2666MHz of DDR4 ECC RAM, rendering is super fast.

""At least two students were killed and 17 other people were injured in a school shooting on Tuesday at Marshall County High School in Benton, Ky.

The suspect, a 15-year-old student at the school, was taken into custody in “a nonviolent apprehension,” Gov. Matt Bevin said on Tuesday.

The student, who was not immediately identified, entered the school with a handgun at 7:59 a.m., according to Richard W. Sanders, commissioner of the Kentucky State Police. The student will be charged with murder and attempted murder, he said.

A 15-year-old girl died at the school, and a 15-year-old boy died later in a hospital, the officials said.""

Why giving up or reducing Wheat and gluten can improve your health

Aside from the fact that a grain free diet is a low carb diet that should help you lose weight, what specific benefits are there from cutting wheat out of the diet? This is the question that the video covers. Books like wheat belly have enhanced the popularity of gluten free diets, but due to their very rapid increasing popularity, such diets have redeemed the status of ""fad."" Nutrition is always complicated, as the human body is - this topic is no different. I covered some of the reasons why cutting out gluten should evoke weight loss and improve health, especially gut health and conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, but there are actually a couple more reasons to avoid gluten not mentioned here. 

A PDF with the transcript and sources can be found here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/16851328
________
★Correction: Please disregard the table shown at 4:09 as it doesn't actually present a significant difference in muscle & liver lipids in the control and gluten free mice. Based on the other findings in the study, the point that gluten could exacerbate insulin resistance, diabetes and fatty liver still stands. 

(The study suggests that gluten results in metabolic alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism in GF group instead reduction of lipid absorption.) You can read the full study here: [ http://www.medicinabiomolecular.com.br/biblioteca/pdfs/Biomolecular/mb-0416.pdf ]

Lyrics:
Can’t help seeking corners
Of dark and dead end rooms
Where the drinks keep pouring down
And the candles keep me warm

Isolation tenders
something fragile coming soon
skinny angels making eyes at cameras
perched in every room

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
left my heart out somewhere running
wanting strangers to be mine

Memory’s a sacred meat that’s drying all the time
on a hillside I remember I am loving losing life

Strawberries in springtime
pretty happy accidents
my awareness that I’m lucky rolling clouds over cement

Maybe there’s a screenplay
or a bathroom I can hide
down the hallways of a high school
and the dances left behind

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
left my heart out somewhere running
wanting strangers to be mine

I would climb the Eiffel Tower write letters on the sky
how many turns it took to reach you

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
on a hillside I remember
I am loving losing life",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M0vMIQLXxqQ/sddefault.jpg,0.01196800156362342,0.00017800177303726867,67.23529411764707,0.0007224777846806787,0.012146003336660686,0.012868481121341363,2018-05-11,13:44:54,Friday,4,6,1,6,1,28,2,4,2,5,0,0,0,1,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.9749350432762522,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

It's cheap and versatile, but the environmental consequences of the booming industry are huge.

Millions of acres of rainforest, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia, have been destroyed to make way for oil palm plantations. Forest species are being pushed to the brink of extinction, and fires have created a blanket of smog that’s smashing air pollution records.

Palm oil production has more than tripled since 2000 — but Norway may have the found a solution to limit the massive deforestation that is being caused by the booming industry — a viral consumer boycott.

Between 2011 and 2012, Norway’s consumption of palm oil dropped by more than 60 percent after a campaign urged consumers to stop “eating the rainforest”.

“Today, all Norwegian food products are produced without palm oil or extremely negligible amounts of it,” said Lars Løvold, Executive Director of the Rainforest Foundation.

After ice fishing several shallow ponds without much luck, I decided to switch gears and move to a tidal river! Due to the fluctuating water levels, the safety of the ice was a big concern, but I was equipped with the proper safety gear and brought a buddy along to help me ice fish a spot I've  never tried before. It took us a little while to pattern the fish, but once we did it was non-stop action until we had to leave. Ice fishing is a entirely different animal from what I'm accustomed to, but everyday spent on the ice gets me a little closer to becoming an ice fishing master!

“If you were to melt the whole Greenland ice sheet here, we’re talking about around seven metres sea level rise”, says Thomas Juul-Pedersen, a senior scientist at the Greenland Climate Research Centre. “There’s always been a melting season, but that melting season seems to dramatically increase"", he says. Since the 1950s, the island's average temperature has risen 1.5 degrees, bringing droughts and even tundra fires. Now vast swathes of sandy desert sit alongside rapidly melting ice. ""It hurts the heart"", says Inuit photographer Adam Lyberth, who has spent 35 years documenting the changing landscape. But while Greenland's shifting seasons present a huge worldwide threat, for some on the island the warmer summers are a welcome change. ""Climate change takes many surprising ways"", says Teunis Jansen, who notes that the first mackerel was caught in Greenland in 2011. To give an indication of the speed of Greenland's climate change, within just a few years there were 85,000 tonnes of the warm water fish. ""It corresponds to about 20-24% of the national export of Greenland"", says Jansen.

He was also turning heads when he competed in Nike’s Elite 11 camp where he competed against some of the top quarterbacks at his level. One of the coaches in the coaching staff took the time to recognize Tagovailoa as MVP, but also to apologize for doubting his skills.

A real estate investment firm owned by Bill Gates has invested in a project to build a smart city in the Arizona desert.

Gates' Cascade Investment LLC paid around $80 million for a large stake in a 24,800 acre development called Belmont, according to the Arizona Republic.

The area is around 50 miles west of Phoenix in an area called West Valley. 

""Belmont will create a forward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs,"" Belmont Partners, the Arizona real estate investment firm involved in the project, said in a news release.   

The city will have 3,800 acres for office, commercial and retail space as well as 470 acres for public schools. Belmont will also have 80,000 residential homes.

One of the reasons Belmont was chosen is its location next to the proposed Interstate 11 freeway, which has yet to receive funding. If completed, Interstate 11 would run from Reno, Nevada to Mexico, the Arizona Republic reported.

Part of an upper jaw with teeth, the fossil was discovered in 2002 on Mount Carmel in northern Israel.

Also, will fan favorites like ""Logan"", ""Get Out"" and ""Wonder Woman"" make the cut, or be cast aside as genre fare? Will Guillermo del Toro continue his hot streak as ""The Shape of Water"" mastermind? All these questions and more as we get ready for the Oscars on March 4, 2018.

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  “Ready Player One” was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. 

“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”). 

Behind the scenes, Spielberg reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).

Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release beginning Thursday, March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

Lyrics: 
Written by Cory Asbury, Ran Jackson, Ricky Jackson, and Brian Johnson

Verse 1

In the morning when I rise to meet You
In the morning when I lift my eyes
You're the only One I wanna cling to
You're the first thought on my mind 

Chorus
 
Let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with Heaven’s song 
Singing out an endless alleluia 

Verse 2

In the moments where You go unnoticed
In the ordinary day to day
Countless miracles of life around us
Point like arrows to Your name

Bridge

Only a moment to live this life
Like shooting stars burning up the night
Till Heaven’s opened and we arrive
In Your presence Lord
In Your presence

Verse 3

In the evening when I lay my head down
In the evening when I close my eyes
You're still the only One I wanna cling to 
You're the last thought on my mind

""Fight for your lives, before it’s someone else’s job.""

""We can’t only focus on school shootings. Urban and low-income communities have always been hit with gun violence.""

""I lost my uncle due to gun violence in Brooklyn 15 years ago. And nothing has changed. Columbine happened, nothing changed. Sandy Hook happened, nothing changed. Parkland happened. Nothing changed.""

""It’s been 36 days and nothing’s happened. Nothing’s changed. We have to move fast.""

March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students of all ethnicities, religions, and sexualities across the country. We will no longer sit and wait for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass shootings.

But as long as you're far from the blast, you're safe, right? Wrong. In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.’s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

We’ve included watching Bryce lie in court with no regret for his actions, watching Justin struggle with his addiction & home life, finding out about the polaroids in the clubhouse, seeing Jessica suffer from PTSD, Hannah’s service, when the court ruled the school to be not guilty, when Hannah’s song played at the school dance and more.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MAQ-tp-ONCQ/sddefault.jpg,0.015347864630209847,0.0001319591535666191,116.30769230769228,0.0004500145493425728,0.01547982378377647,0.01592983833311904,2018-05-01,08:35:02,Tuesday,1,9,39,9,34,61,354,2,79,0,1,6,18,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5685453140478804,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

However, just talking about the characters I want back would be a lot of the series staples who’d I expect to return. As with my previous wishlist videos for upcoming fighting games, I like to take a look at some of the lesser potential roster choices who may need a bit more love and don’t have as much of a chance as other series mainstays. So for this video, I’m looking at Soulcalibur characters I’d like to see playable again (even it’s just DLC) that we don’t hear from much, whether they’ve been playable, bonus characters, or just a part of the lore.

Do Crocodile, Fifteen Million Merits, and Hated in the Nation take place in the same universe? Is Black Museum purgatory?

More on Doppler radar:
Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808

There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).

This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.

What if games had an ""Impossible"" difficulty setting? I'm not talking about difficult bosses or tight platforming segments, I mean solving some puzzles! A bit of creativity combined with glitches allows us to make our own puzzles in Paper Mario - but just how difficult can we make them? The answer: theoretically impossible!

Technically speaking, these are softlocks tied to save files. To retain the ""puzzle"" fantasy behind this video, we are sticking with softlocks that allow the player to move around and interact with the world, only to find they cannot progress the game's story. Ever. There are enough of these puzzle softlocks at our disposal to do a unique impossible puzzle for all four game saves on a single cartridge.

For a written explanation of these file softlocks, head here! I recommend watching the video first though. I was going to add it in the description here, but YouTube says it was too long...

LYRICS:
INTRO:
Career boy
Working overtime
With one thing on my mind

VERSE 1:
Cheap office coffee stays pumping through my veins
I work for the man, (yeah) but you know I love the chains
I can never fight the feeling
I stay up all night
working so hard after hours
till I see the sunlight 
stuck up in the office tower, you know it’s pure joy 
and that’s my super power, I’m a career boy

CHORUS: 
Career Boy
You know they got me working overtime (yeah)
Career Boy
And you know I got that one track mind (oh yeah)
Even after I get what I want I can see baby baby, that it’s lonely at the top.
Career Boy
Nothing is ever ever gonna make me stop.

VERSE 2:
Business and pleasure. I like to mix the two.
Hanging in the break room mixing it with you.
I can never fight the feeling
I stay up all night
working so hard after hours
till I see the sunlight 
Stuck (up) in the office tower, you know it’s pure joy 
and that’s my super power, I’m a career boy.

CHORUS: 
Career Boy
You know they got me working overtime (yeah)
Career Boy
And you know I got that one track mind (oh yeah)
Even after I get what I want I can see baby baby, that it’s lonely at the top.
Career Boy
Nothing is ever ever gonna make me stop.


BRIDGE: 
I’m addicted to the work, yeah. 
I love the way it hurts, yeah.
The suits and pencil skirts.
I get what I need, ‘cause I’m greedy for it. 
Cos I’m addicted to the pressure.
Yeah but the burden is a pleasure.
So come on hit me with your ledger. 
Close to the edge, face down on the desk I’m…

CHORUS: 
Career Boy
You know they got me working overtime (yeah)
Career Boy
And you know I got that one track mind (oh yeah)
Even after I get what I want I can see baby baby, that it’s lonely at the top.
Career Boy
Nothing is ever ever gonna make me stop.

BIO:
Rising pop star Dorian Electra makes music that defies gender norms. In the past year, their work has gained a queer cult following and led to them being named a must-know talent by Buzzfeed and one of PAPER Magazine’s ""100 Women Revolutionizing Pop."" Not only that, but Electra has also quickly built a dedicated following thanks to their futuristic spin on 00s pop, 80s funk, and a long-standing love of satirizing rigid gender roles and views on sexuality. A frequent Charli XCX collaborator, Electra was featured on the Pop 2 track “Femmebot (feat. Dorian Electra and Mykki Blanco)” alongside Mykki Blanco. They have also played live with XCX at a number of self-curated shows and after parties. Most recently, Electra performed at NYC Pride 2018, toured with British pop sensation Rina Sawayama, and supported Russian group Pussy Riot on their first U.S. tour. Electra’s last three singles and music videos, “Career Boy"" ""VIP"" and ""Man To Man"" have garnered press and playlist spots from Billboard, The Fader, and Buzzfeed among others. 2019 welcomes the release of Dorian Electra’s debut album ""Flamboyant"" and first headlining tour.

The globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising.

John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave his life to secure humanity’s victory against the monstrous “Kaiju.” Jake has since abandoned his training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war.  As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction.

Jake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left.  Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale.

The guys were kind enough to send this out to me to play with. These are especially good if you don't have the time, materials or experience to make full on prosthetics (and sculpts, and moulds) but want to apply them for projects. Highly professional quality, I loooove them. 

Also huge thanks to my very talented friend Andrew Hall for helping me to film this tutorial.

Watch cute puppy Potpie battle an orange for the first time! The curious beagle puppy dog's reaction to smelling and tasting the citrus fruit is adorably hilarious. The funny dog dances around the fruit, biting and growling at the annoying orange. The cute puppy is then surprised with a whole bag of oranges, and his beagle siblings Maymo & Penny join in on the fun!

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is, for the most part, an extremely kid-friendly franchise when it comes to its content.

The likes of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, Star-Lord and Spider-Man have become iconic in mainstream pop culture circles - and that's thanks largely to the fact that children idolise them as if they were real-life superheroes!

But there are undoubtedly some moments in the franchise that simply aren't suitable for younger eyes and ears - and that's what this video is all about.

These are ten Marvel movie moments that aren't for kids - and it should be noted that this video contains spoilers for a number of movies up to and including Avengers: Infinity War.

The moments in question are; Hulk smashing Emily Blonsky in The Incredible Hulk, Pepper Potts and Tony Stark referring to Christine Everhart doing ""quite a spread"" on Stark in Iron Man 2, Loki calling Black Widow a ""mewling quim"" in The Avengers, the entirety of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Peter Quill saying his ship would look like ""a Jackson Pollock painting"" under a black light in Guardians of the Galaxy, Tony Stark saying Clint Barton ""can't get it up"" in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Tony Stark suggesting Bruce Banner and Black Widow might be playing ""hide the zucchini"" in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ned Leeds saying he was ""watching p*rn"" in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Loki's brutal death in Avengers: Infinity War, and Scott Lang and Bill Foster ""comparing sizes"" in Ant-Man and The Wasp.

We hope you enjoy the video. Let us know what you think in the comments. And please remember to subscribe to Screen Rant's YouTube channel so you never miss our great new videos in the future.

Featuring: 

1. Hulk smashes Blonsky
2. Quite a spread
3. Mewling quim
4. Captain America: The Winter Soldier
5. A Jackson Pollock Painting
6. Hawkeye can't get it up
7. Hide the zucchini
8. Ned's excuse
9. Loki's death

About DEA agents Steve Murphy and Javier Pena:

You may have seen TV shows and documentaries, or read books about the world’s wealthiest, and most violent drug trafficker, but now you have the opportunity to hear the real story of what happened in the investigation of Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel.
 
DEA special agents Javier Peña and Steve Murphy were assigned as the lead investigators targeting Escobar and his organization. These true American heroes provide a first-hand lesson in history as they discuss their efforts bringing down the world’s first narco-terrorist, the challenges they faced in oftentimes hostile and life-threatening environments, and the innovative strategies they employed to successfully end the reign of terror of the world’s most wanted criminal. Their presentation is followed by a Q&A opportunity during which Javier and Steve will entertain questions related to their investigation, the making of Narcos, what history changing investigation is next for them, and more.

    Suitable for everyday driving in a range of environments
    4.0 liter V8 twin-turbo engine with 650 hp and 850 Nm of torque for maximum performance
    Acceleration 0-100 km/h in 3.6 seconds and top speed 305 km/h
    4WD system with active torque vectoring and four-wheel steering for perfect handling
    Carbon ceramic brakes, adaptive air suspension and active roll stabilization for maximum safety and comfort
    Up to six different driving modes + EGO mode available via ‘Tamburo’ driving dynamics selector 

Sant’Agata Bolognese, 4 December 2017 – Automobili Lamborghini launches its third model the Lamborghini Urus, the first Super Sport Utility Vehicle, and creates a new niche in the luxury segment with benchmarking power, performance and driving dynamics, unparalleled design, luxury and daily usability.

“The Lamborghini Urus is a visionary approach based on the infusion of Lamborghini DNA into the most versatile vehicle, the SUV. The Urus elevates the SUV to a level not previously possible, the Super SUV. It is a true Lamborghini in terms of design, performance, driving dynamics and emotion as well as drivable every day in a range of environments,” says Stefano Domenicali, Automobili Lamborghini Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The Urus fits perfectly within the Lamborghini family as a high performance car. It is the culmination of intensive development and passionate skill to create a new breed of bull: a Super SUV that transcends the boundaries of expectations and opens the door to new possibilities, for both our brand and our customers.”

The Urus features a 4.0 liter V8 twin-turbo engine delivering 650 hp (478 kW) at 6,000 rpm, maximum 6,800 rpm, and 850 Nm of maximum torque already at 2,250 rpm. With 162.7 hp/l the Urus claims one of the highest specific power outputs in its class and the best weight-to-power ratio at 3,38 kg/hp.

The Urus accelerates from 0-100 km/h in 3.6 seconds, 0-200 km/h in 12,8 seconds and with a top speed of 305 km/h it is the fastest SUV available.

Urus: a multi-faceted personality 
The Lamborghini Urus is as much a luxury SUV as the most powerful, with a super sports car dynamism to be enjoyed by both driver and passengers.
Its low-line coupé styling and commanding road position belie the very comfortable ride, higher ground clearance, and luxurious space within together with the latest technologies. The Urus provides easy driving in the city, maximum comfort during long journeys, thrilling super sports car dynamics on the road and track, and versatile off-road abilities in a range of environments. The Lamborghini Urus has a dual personality: it is multi-dimensional. It can be specified to be as sporty or as elegant as the owner wishes, and can equally be used as a daily luxury drive or provide an exhilarating super sports experience.

However, when the benevolent ruler of Thrace and his daughter seek his help in defeating a savage warlord, Hercules must find the true hero within himself once again. Greek god.

Even though the Grammys are about celebrating talented musical performers, it’s also a chance for celebrities to dress to impress. Strolling the red carpet is a big deal, and among the sea of celebs donning gorgeous dresses, there are always a few stand outs. We will show you ten incredible dresses that left the crowd stunned. Rihanna may have a reputation for being a bit of a bad girl, but her sweet pink dress certainly had cameras clicking. Accessorizing can be hard, but Katy Perry rose to the challenge by pairing her electric blue hair with a dress that would make Elsa proud. Selena Gomez showed up with Taylor Swift on her arm, and wearing a gorgeous Calvin Klein dress. Some people had something negative to say about the dress Adele wore one year, but we are sure that the handful of Grammys she took homemade her feel better about the situation.

Here is a great hack that may actually save your life one day. If you are lost and do not have paper to lit the fire, check if you have some chips with you.

3. How to open a bottle using paper
How many times have you been in this amazing situation: you bought a cold refreshing drink but can't find a bottle opener? No need to worry! All you need is a sheet of paper. Yes, you read it right! Just fold the paper multiple times and use it as a bottle opener. A very easy and very handy trick.

4. How not to fall asleep at work or at school
Sometimes all of use are having these sleepy days when we just cannot concentrate on anything. Maybe you've had a really nice party or a sleepless night with your child - the reason doesn't matter as the result is the same: you are falling asleep at work or at school. We got it covered! Just chew some chewing gum. It will refresh you and keep you concentrated.

Here are 8 new games that could well be the next Fortnite. Subscribe to Outside Xbox for more: http://tinyurl.com/SubToOxbox

While you might feel like Fortnite is all you need in a game, each of these Battle Royale or Battle Royale inspired games has its own twist on the formula, which changes the gameplay. Whether that's introducing audience participation like in SOS, adding more survival elements like The Darwin Project or just straight up being Overwatch Battle Royale, like Paladins: Battlegrounds plans to be. Hey if you're going to borrow ideas from two games, Overwatch and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds are a pretty good pick.

1) Patty Jenkins a runner up for Time Magazine’s Person of the Year; Silence Breakers named Person of the Year

2) Rob Marshall is Disney’s Top Choice to Direct Live-Action Little Mermaid

3) Ryan Reynolds to star in Pokemon Movie 'Detective Pikachu'

4) New logo and tagline spotted at Comic Con Experience Brazil for Sony’s Venom

5) ‘You Were Never Really Here’ Trailer: Joaquin Phoenix Is a Brutal Fixer

6) Mail Bag

7) Live twitter Questions

Two months after women began to come forward accusing men in power of sexual harassment and assault, Time Magazine named these women “The Silence Breakers” and awarded them Person of the Year. The list came down to seven finalists for the prestigious award, including Colin Kaepernick, Robert Mueller, Donald Trump and finally, a woman that changed the landscape of female driven superheroes: director Patty Jenkins.

In a report from Deadline, it looks as though Disney has made Rob Marshall their top choice to direct The Little Mermaid, the live action adaptation of the animated musical that will have new songs by Hamilton‘s Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alan Menken. The outlet states that they have heard Marshall has been offered the movie, and is now reading the Jane Goldman script; taking until after the holidays to decide.

BUY OR SELL

THR reports that Ryan Reynolds has signed on to star in in Legendary’s live-action Pokemon movie Detective Pikachu. Goosebumps director Rob Letterman is directing the project, which is due to start shooting mid-January in London. Pikachu is a species of Pokemon, whereas Detective Pikachu is a character from the Pikachu set; and known as a self-styled investigator good at finding things. Reynolds will play the role of Detective Pikachu, which is said to be motion-capture in nature.

While at Comic Con Experience in Brazil, Collider’s own Steve Weintraub stumbled upon the Sony booth and found, somewhat hidden, a new banner for Venom revealing what could appear to be the film’s logo and tagline: We Are Venom.

Amazon Studios has released a new trailer for the critically acclaimed thriller You Were Never Really Here. Written and directed by We Need to Talk About Kevin filmmaker Lynne Ramsay, the film stars Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatized veteran who tracks down missing girls for a living.

Dr. Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people.

The first few (spin, paw, come, jump through a hoop, jump to hand) are confidence building tricks, with come possibly being the most important ""trick"" you can train your rat. 

Target, backup, and pull a string are also pretty easy to train, and have the added bonus of being the basis for many more complex tricks. 

Finally, fetch and basketball can be considered a bit harder to teach, but are the basis and groundwork for just about every item-based trick out there. I recommend training your rat(s) tricks in this order as well, so by the time you get to fetch and basketball, your rat will already understand that their actions influence if they get a reward or not and you will know how your rat learns, and thus be able to train them more effectively.

Anyway, have fun training, and if you have any questions, feel free to comment them down below.

No, you're not growing.

Yes, the airlines have been squishing seats closer together. It's called the pitch, and it's been chopped down by two to three inches over the years.

That's not the only place where the big three are sneaking space from you. Here's a helpful representation of just how much room your ticket gets you on your next flight. The following is a transcript of the video.

How airline seats have shrunk over the years. Feeling cramped? You're not alone. Airlines are adding more seats, leaving less room for individual passengers. The pitch, or distance between seats, has shrunk. The minimum pitch has gone from 31""/32"" to 30"".

It's not just the pitch. Seat width has also been narrowed over the years. Each airline has lost about 2 inches in seat width. These aren't even the smallest. Some airlines fill the Airbus A330 with 16.7"" seats. For comparison, the average first class seat is 21"" wide.

One small study compared sleep quality in 17"" vs. 18"" wide seats. 2/3 of passengers who slept in the 18"" seats reported better quality sleep. Plus, passengers fell asleep faster and had fewer twitches in the 18"" seats. So if you plan on catching some Zzz's on your flight, dish out the cash for a seat upgrade.

The first episode is on the most internationally famous thing to happen to the country in recent history: the story of Pinochet and Allende. As much as we've avoided Pinochet-era stories for most of this season, we figured since everyone knew about it we should get it out of the way first. Hope you like it.

Also, since this was filmed at the end of the trip, I get it, I'm looking haggard. Imagine I'm Brad Pitt and it'll work out.

This video contains Stranger Things Season 2 spoilers so if you’re not caught up, you might want to come back to this video later. With that out of the way, here’s what we’ve learned about Season 3 since the release of Season 2 through interviews with executive producers Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen by Collider’s own Steve Weintraub, as well as some quotes from The Duffer Brothers themselves.

From the minds of the Duffer Brothers, Stranger Things Season 2 starred Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, David Harbour, Winona Ryder, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Noah Schnapp, Joe Keery with Sean Astin and Paul Reiser.

Chances are that if you've ever been to In-N-Out Burger, you were sold after your first bite — that toasted sponge bread, the fresh-never-frozen patty, the grilled onions, the secret sauce — it's the antithesis of most drive-thru burgers. It's no surprise that the chain that has long been heralded the ""it"" fast food restaurant since its opening in 1948, has managed to gain a cult following that other burger joints could only wish to achieve.   Though there's plenty of talk of the chain's not-so-secret menu, there might be a few unknown tidbits that even the biggest aficionados don't know about their beloved burger spot. We're digging into some surprising In-N-Out Burger facts, but be warned, you might get a little hungry…

Donald Glover, AKA Childish Gambino, grew up a Jehovah's Witness in the Atlanta suburbs, with two siblings and a number of foster children his parents cared for. His initial goal in life was to become a wedding planner but as he began to develop other artistic talents he would simultaneously developed separate and thriving careers in Sketch Comedy, Stand Up, Writing, Acting, and Rap. All of these things came together in the creation of his critically acclaimed FX show, Atlanta, which is currently in it's 3rd season.

Twitch is the world’s leading social video platform and community for gamers, video game culture, and the creative arts. Each day, close to 10 million visitors gather to watch and talk about video games with more than 2 million streamers.

Dota 2 is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare.

Galaxy Battles II: Emerging Worlds is the second series of Galaxy Battles. The event will be held at Manila, Philippines, where eight teams will compete for their chance at the $500,000 USD prize pool.
The event was initially planned to be part of the Dota Pro Circuit but lost its Major status on January 4th. As a result, several high profile teams withdrew from the tournament, reducing the number of participating teams from sixteen to eight.

Navy Seals abide by a code that no man is left behind. Termite-hunting ants abide by a similar code. A new study reveals that after a raid on a termite nest, the injured ants are cared for by their comrades. If kept by themselves, 80 percent of injured ants died. But if cared for by their nest-mates for even an hour, only a tenth died. Another finding of the study reveals how the ants prioritize who gets cared for and who doesn’t. In human health care, doctors decide which patients need to be helped the most. With ants, it’s the exact opposite. The injured ants themselves decide if they should be treated or not. When no help was in sight, injured ants made a beeline for the nest. But when nest-mates were near, they stumbled and fell, appearing “more injured” as a way to attract aid. But the ants play up their injuries only if they sensed that their problems were minor enough to be treated. If ants were mortally injured, they refused to cooperate, flailing their legs around when probed or picked up, forcing their helpers to abandon them. The mortally wounded ants choose to die rather than have energy and resources wasted on their futile rehabilitation. This discovery marks the first time non-human animals have been observed systematically nursing their wounded back to health.

1) Ben Affleck Says He’s Looking for a “Cool Way to Segue Out” of the DCU

2) James Bond 25’ Likely to Land at Annapurna for Domestic Distribution

3) Opening This Week- Justice League

4) Sony developing new Spider-Man spin-off: ‘Morbius the Living Vampire,’ with 'Power Rangers' writers

5) The Greatest Showman’: New Trailer Takes Hugh Jackman from Scoundrel to Superstar

6) Mail Bag 

7) Live Twitter Questions


On the week that Justice League hits theatres, Ben Affleck has again, gone on record, to say that he is in fact looking for a way to exit from the DCEU. That may not come until Matt Reeves’ proposed stand-alone Batman movie but if Affleck’s comments are to be believed, it could happen very soon.  As part of a lengthy profile in USA Today, Affleck reveals he’s looking for a good way to phase his Batman out of the DCEU.

The distribution rights for James Bond expired at Sony after Spectre, which led to studios bidding for the right to distribute. Now, according to Deadline, a deal between rights-holder MGM and distributor Annapurna will likely be finalized later this week as a done deal. While the producers believe Annapurna will have a strong domestic distribution strategy for Bond, MGM and EON are still looking to see which studio will handle worldwide distribution as 70% of Bond’s box office revenue comes from overseas.

OPENING THIS WEEK

According to The Wrap, Sony is moving forward on yet another Spider-Man spin-off, this time setting Power Rangers writers Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama to pen a Morbius feature project centered on Spider-Man antihero Morbius the Living Vampire. Morbius was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Gil Kane and first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #101, the first issue not written by Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee. 

The new trailer for Fox’s upcoming musical drama The Greatest Showman has landed online. Featuring musical works of Academy Award-winning La La Land lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the movie is inspired by the imagination of P.T. Barnum and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.

1) Citi Analysts predict Apple to buy Netflix after landmark Disney/Fox deal

2) Female-Led Films Top Box Office for the First Time in 59 Years 

3) Christian Bale confirms he was in talks for ‘Solo’; hopeful for ‘future discussions’

4) First Trailer for Mom and Dad starring Nicolas Cage released

5) New ‘Fifty Shades Freed’ Trailer 

6) Mail Bag 

7) Live Twitter Questions

In a new report from Business Insider, there’s a chance Apple could buy Netflix after the landmark Disney/Fox deal happened, this according to analysts for Citi. Though Citi’s experts give it a 40% chance of happening, Forbes reporter Karl Kaufman argues against it because Apple has already committed $1 billion towards creating new shows and movies. Both companies have not commented on any deal, nor are there any talks at this time.  

According to a report from The Wrap, the three top-performing films of 2017: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, and Wonder Woman, were all headlined by female leads, something that hasn’t happened since 1958. According to data from Box Office Madness and Box Office Mojo, the top film of 1958 was South Pacific starring Mitzi Gaynor, the second was the comedy Auntie Mame, which starred Rosalind Russell as a Manhattan socialite and in third was the adaptation of Tennessee Williams’ Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, starring Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role as Maggie. 

BUY/SELL/AGREE/DISAGREE

On a recent appearance on Josh Horowitz’s podcast Happy Sad Confused, Christian Bale revealed that he was in talks with Lucasfilm to appear in Solo: A Star Wars Story, before ultimately passing - giving Woody Harrelson access to the part in the end.

The first trailer for Mom and Dad has landed online. The film comes from writer/director Brian Taylor, one half of the directing duo that helmed Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and the first two Crank films. For his first solo effort, Taylor takes on a darkly comic action thriller in which parents of a small suburban town suddenly have the urge to murder their children. Mom and Dad stars Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair and will hit theatres and VOD on January 19th.

Universal Pictures has released a new trailer for Fifty Shades Freed. In the final installment of the trilogy, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) tie the knot, but demons from both their paths threaten to rip apart their happiness. The film opens on February 9th.

So why is a robot startled by a task of folding a wrinkled sock? Neural engineer Polina Anikeeva, Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, describes how differences in natural ""brain hardware"" and solid-state electronics lead to differences between human and artificial intelligence, and what challenges and opportunities stem from those differences. Prof. Polina Anikeeva joined DMSE in 2011. Dr. Anikeeva's Ph.D. thesis focussed on physical properties and design of light emitting devices based on organic materials and nanoparticles, working under the supervision of Prof. Vladimir Bulovic in EECS. She previously held the Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship, School of Medicine, Stanford and was in the group of Prof. Karl Deisseroth in the Department of Bioengineering. Her current research is focused on development of optoelectronic and magnetic materials and devices for recording and modulating activity of neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral organs.

I woke up early due to my mom loudly getting ready. Since this happens often, i knew i wasn't going back to sleep. So I rolled over grabbed my phone and let the light burn my eyes. It wasn't until I went to the Line app and scrolled to my timeline. One of my friends posted about how sweet ""J' 's voice was and how she was going to miss him. I asked her who was ""J"". She told me it was Jonghyun. And for a second I thought he just left the group. I hoped he just left the group. But she followed up with ""He passed."" At first I thought we were in April and this was just a prank. But it wasn't. And it's heartbreaking. My first shinee bias. And my ultimate bias. The main vocal of our hearts. Gone. I don't think I can recover from this loss. I hope you enjoyed. (And yes I know he did not sing Playboy but he wrote it and this video needed this masterpiece.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

The election is on Tuesday. A Democrat hasn’t won a U.S. Senate race in Alabama for 20 years. Polling shows the two candidates are neck and neck, despite Moore being accused by at least nine women of sexually harassing or assaulting them when they were teenagers. President Donald Trump has repeatedly endorsed Roy Moore, including on Friday, when he held a rally in Pensacola, Florida, which is 20 miles from the Alabama border and in the same media market as Mobile, Alabama. Roy Moore has had a long and highly controversial political career in Alabama that’s been marked by racism, homophobia, Islamophobia and religious fanaticism. Over the weekend, the Doug Jones campaign orchestrated a massive get-out-the-vote effort, particularly targeting African-American voters. A number of prominent African-American politicians, including New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, Alabama Congressmember Terri Sewell and former Massachusetts Democratic Governor Deval Patrick, all campaigned for Jones over the weekend. For more, we speak with Peter Montgomery, senior fellow at People for the American Way. His most recent piece is headlined “There’s More Than One Roy Moore Scandal.”

In the opening round of the Memorial Tournament presented by Nationwide 2018, Tiger Woods has a rough start, but after a couple of tweaks, finishes out with an even par round.

In the final round of the 2017 event, Jason Dufner pulled off a come-from-behind win with a clutch par putt from 33 feet on the 72nd hole, beating Rickie Fowler and Anirban Lahiri by three shots.
