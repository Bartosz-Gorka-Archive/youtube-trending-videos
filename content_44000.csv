The bizarre footage clearly shows that the railway is impossible to see and is not apparently marked in any way with signs, never mind flashing warning lights or boom gates.

The remarkable images were shot in the city of Baku in Eastern Azerbaijan, the 7 lane motorway seems to be called Neftchilar Avenue. And the footage was most likely filmed from the Glass Tower across the road. 

This video best explains what you are seeing in the video, and why the train crosses the motorway at that location with no warnings or boom gates.

► Train Track Location = The City of Baku in Eastern Azerbaijan. The train crosses Port Baku Park then across Neftchilar Avenue Baku City. https://www.google.com/maps/@40.3753643,49.8632437,214m/data=!3m1!1e3

► If you want to check out the area yourself, type ""Port Baku Park"" into Google Earth and it will zoom right into the area.

► If you click on google earth, use the back arrow clock button on the top taskbar and go to 9/21/2015 and 4/17/2016 on the slider bar you can actually see the trains going across the road.

Thanks for watching.

Для тебя не осталось слов и мыслей хороших, нет. 
А я - новая, новая, ночь превращаю в рассвет, но снова одна. 
Я запуталась в глянце. Мы почти иностранцы в нём.
Ты хотел уходить и смотреть, как я буду потом 
Бежать за тобой босиком. 

Сегодня, сегодня, сегодня ты, а завтра я. 
Запомни, мой сладкий – 
Все люди, как люди, а я - Суперзвезда. 
Звезда! А я - суперзвезда! Звезда! 

Мы другие планеты. Видно выбора больше нет. 
А я, da -; а я, da -; а я, dance станцевала тебе, красивый такой. 
А слова твои резали нежно. Сопротивляться почти бесполезно. 
Всё на паузу, всё на потом; на потом, на потом, на потом. 

А я, о -, а я очень хотела забыть обо всём. 
Бежать за тобой босиком. 

Сегодня, сегодня, сегодня ты, а завтра я. 
Запомни, мой сладкий – 
Все люди, как люди, а я - Суперзвезда. 
Звезда! А я - суперзвезда! Да, Звезда! 

Как всегда неразлучен ты с телефонными с*. 
Мне с тобой очень скучно - не такая, как все я. 
Stop yelling like a bitch! 
Я могу всего сама достичь. 
Люди, как люди. Низкие старты. 
Три к одному, что ты плачешь друзьям 
То, что я виновата, всё - окей. Зову подруг, прихожу с утра. 
Да, мне можно всё, я же суперзвезда. 

А я - суперзвезда! А я - суперзвезда! 
Звезда! А я - суперзвезда! А я - суперзвезда! 
А я - суперзвезда! Звезда! 
Суперзвезда!

The following list has been separated into three parts: beginner, intermediate and experienced. Suggestions for beginners are mainly static affairs, whilst intermediate and experienced games provide increasing levels of motion that may cause discomfort to those new to VR.

LETRA:
[Intro: Demi Lovato & Luis Fonsi]
Hey Fonsi?
Oh no
¿Qué pasa Demi?
Hey, yeah

[Verso: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato]
Tengo en esta historia algo que confesar
Ya entendí muy bien que fue lo que pasó
Y aunque duela tanto tengo que aceptar
Que tú no eres la mala, que el malo soy yo
No me conociste nunca de verdad
Ya se fue la magia que te enamoro
Y es que no quisiera estar en tu lugar
Porque tu error sólo fue conocerme

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato & with Luis Fonsi]
Okay, I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah
I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & (Demi Lovato) & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Dúo]
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato + Luis Fonsi]
Okay, I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah
I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & (Demi Lovato) & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Post-Coro: Dúo]
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa

Ryobi P238 18-Volt One+ 1/4 in. Brushless Impact Driver

Brushless motor
Compatible with lithium+ HP batteries
3-speed switch - high speed: 0-3,100 RPM, medium speed: 0-2,150 RPM, low speed: 0-1,100 RPM
Powerful - 2,200 in./lbs. torque
Up to 4,350 IPM (impacts per minute)
Tri-LED lights
1/4 in. auto-load chuck
New grip zone with micro-texture
Belt clip mounts to either side of tool
Magtray magnetic holder

The Ryobi P238 18-Volt One+ 1/4 in. Brushless Impact Driver is the best Ryobi tool we have used to date with all the power one could ask for from an impact driver.  This tool took 6"" lag bolts and buried them in our tests over and over in a very respectable time.  There was a large difference in performance when used with a compact battery.

Ryobi P423 18-Volt One+ Cordless 4-1/2"" Brushless Cut-Off Tool/Angle Grinder

Brushless motor
Compatible with lithium+ HP batteries
Versatile design is perfect for cutting or grinding applications
Lock-on switch
Compact design
Gripzone over mold with micro-texture
3-position side handle
Onboard storage for spanner wrench
Spindle lock for quick easy wheel change

The Ryobi P423 18-Volt One+ Cordless 4-1/2"" Brushless Cut-Off Tool/Angle Grinder gives the DIY crowd a nice tool for ditching the cord and working on smaller jobs.  In our use, we found this tool to give good power when grinding and sanding but was a bit finicky when it came to cutting.  With occasional timeouts, we were able to get the job done.  This is not a tool one would want to run with a compact battery in any situation.

Ryobi P508 18-Volt One+ 7-1/4"" Brushless Circular Saw

26% increased cut capacity
Brushless motor
LED light illuminates cut line
Full-size 7-1/4 in. blade
Spindle lock for quick and easy blade changes
24T ultra thin kerf carbide-tipped blade
Compatible with lithium+ HP batteries
Gripzone over mold with micro-texture
0-56-degree bevel cut capacity
Left-mount blade
Dust blower keeps cut line clear and visible
On-board wrench storage
Front pommel handle with over mold for 2-handed operation

The Ryobi P508 18-Volt One+ 7-1/4"" Brushless Circular Saw is a huge upgrade over their standard model circular saw.  The design is excellent and the adjustments and blade changes are done quickly and easily.  This saw cross cut like a champ with the 24 tooth blade that is included.  The saw struggled when ripping sheet goods and dimensional lumber.  we detail this more in the video, but this saw has good power and needs to have the large battery to run.

Ryobi P517 18-Volt One+ Brushless Reciprocating Saw

Brushless motor
Compatible with LITHIUM+ HP batteries
Stay-open blade clamp
Orbital action switch
Anti-vibe handle
LED light
Gripzone over mold with micro-texture
Adjustable, pivoting shoe allows depth-of-cut control
Variable speed trigger
Die-cast aluminum gear housing

The Ryobi P517 18-Volt One+ Brushless Reciprocating Saw has a 1-1/8"" stroke with 3,200 strokes per minute making this saw a beast!  Easily put in the correct blade with the tool-free blade holding system and enjoy a nice saw.  Ther is a switch on the side to change between orbital and standard cutting.  the variable speed trigger allows the user to get the correct speed for cutting any material.  We had some time-out issues with this saw with the compact battery and suggest using the larger battery to really get the full use out of this tool!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uB5gnzqso_w/sddefault.jpg,0.008671725913105223,0.000461545289131496,18.78846153846154,0.002653885412506102,0.00913327120223672,0.011787156614742821,2017-11-30,15:00:05,Thursday,3,12,66,12,49,74,588,3,123,0,0,11,1,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.543831152484588,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

It all began in the city of Mashad, a historic Shiite pilgrimage place, the hometown of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and considered one of the bastions of the regime.

Why did these protests occur? What were its causes? Who lit this entire movement’s spark? What can we expect? Will these events have any effect on Iran?

New album OUT May 2018

Arctic Monkeys have announced their new album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino. The follow-up to 2013’s AM is out May 11 via Domino. The new album was co-produced by longtime collaborator James Ford and frontman Alex Turner, and recorded in three cities: Los Angeles, Paris, and London. (This album marks the first time Turner has co-produced an Arctic Monkeys full-length.) Find the tracklist, album trailer, and cover art below.

**Made by fans - not actual AM music - just for fun! Thanks!**

Back in January, Arctic Monkeys announced a tour of international festivals, followed last month by more dates including a North American run. They recently announced the reissue of their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, for Vinyl Me Please.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uCsc2400e34/sddefault.jpg,0.016648846106425187,0.0004818249585782667,34.55372290292177,0.0014718140346391727,0.017130671065003454,0.018602485099642626,2018-05-24,05:46:47,Thursday,3,7,39,7,34,42,345,1,79,0,1,6,18,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.676980956773133,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

I’ll never forget the moment I realized Kendrick Lamar is a genius. I was listening to good kid, m.A.A.d city for the first time when the 4th track, The Art of Peer Pressure came on. It’s a 5 and a half minute journey through Kendrick’s teenage memories, aided by immersive passages of voice acting that depict a formative run in with crime Kendrick had as a young man. As the song crept along with its nighttime synths and lo-fi drums, I lost track of reality. The way Kendrick retells his attempt at a home invasion was so realistic I found myself thinking, just for a moment, “wait...how did he get a recording of this?” before doing a double take and laughing at my own stupidity. Today I want to explore the brilliance of the man who could very well be hip hop’s greatest of all time. Let’s learn more.

And what better way to learn about the gig than to talk to a nurse practitioner? Aimee Carroll joins us this week to tell us about what nurse practitioners do, and the liminal space they occupy between the roles of nurses and doctors. We'll also answer your questions, and talk about the latest on taxes and healthcare, and the big news this week about the so-called  forbidden words in government health bureaucracy.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favorite things! Basically, I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!



These giant filled treats started with 18lbs of my Ultimate Vanilla Cake with the centers scooped out to make room for decadently flavored buttercreams: raspberry, blueberry, and of course my favorite mint chocolate and I Covered them with ivory fondant and topped off with a maple syrup glaze. You can see the full recipe here - http://bit.ly/IceCreamDonutsRecipe

Fueled by boredom, the motorcycle ’sport’ has developed its own distinct subculture on the island. In this short film, Aurélien Heilbronn follows the gangs through the streets for a glimpse inside their underground world of adrenaline, partying, and violence. Despite the risks they take to compete, the bikers share a love for their high-speed stunts and the close-knit community of thrill-seekers built around it.

As a kid, Cindy Thomas dreamed of one day owning a house with a yard. She had always lived in apartments with her mother, Francine Pisani, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia soon after Cindy was born. “I really can’t imagine what that must have been like for her,” Cindy says. “She worked really hard for not very much, but we always had what we needed. We didn’t have a lot, and consequently we never had a house.” But Cindy kept dreaming. 

Years later, Cindy and her husband, David, realized part of her dream when they built a custom home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They also created an attached one-bedroom, one-bathroom unit for her mom so they could all live together. Once settled, they turned their attention to the bare backyard in hopes of creating a healing garden for themselves and Pisani. “There was nothing there but dirt and weeds and a fence,” Cindy says.

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uGnUKuthpm4/sddefault.jpg,0.01677961095162849,0.00012331623157067596,136.06976744186048,0.0008001215955399674,0.016902927183199166,0.017703048778739138,2018-03-20,00:51:35,Tuesday,1,18,52,17,50,98,484,1,121,1,3,11,0,4,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.322946063635443,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Lilium enables you to travel 5 times faster than a car by introducing the world’s first all-electric vertical take-off and landing jet: an air taxi for up to 5 people. You won’t have to own one, you will simply pay per ride and call it with a push of a button. It’s our mission to make air taxis available to everyone and as affordable as riding a car.

In 1894, Otto Lilienthal began experimenting with the first gliders and imagined a future in which we could all fly wherever we want, whenever we want. Lilium is turning that dream into reality. We are bringing personalized, clean and affordable air travel to everyone.

The Lilium Jet successfully completed its maiden test flight series in the skies above Bavaria. The 2-seater Eagle prototype executed a range of complex maneuvers, including its signature mid-air transition from hover mode to wing-borne forward flight.

He's seen it, and here's his response.

How did you feel about Luke Skywalker? Snoke? Rey? Kylo Ren?
How do you feel about George Lucas?
I found it odd how Rian compared himself a bit to George...
What did you think of that?

Can you spot all the 'Twice Upon A Time' easter eggs? 

The magical final chapter of the Twelfth Doctor's (Peter Capaldi) journey sees the Time Lord team up with his former self, the first ever Doctor (David Bradley - Harry Potter, Game of Thrones) and a returning Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie), for one last adventure. 

Two Doctors stranded in an Arctic snowscape, refusing to face regeneration. Enchanted glass people, stealing their victims from frozen time. And a World War One captain destined to die on the battlefield, but taken from the trenches to play his part in the Doctor's story.

An uplifting new tale about the power of hope in humanity's darkest hours, Twice Upon A Time marks the end of an era. But as the Doctor must face his past to decide his future, his journey is only just beginning.

The Doctor (Peter Capaldi) is an alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through all of time and space in his TARDIS with his companion. Instead of dying, the Doctor is able to ""regenerate"" into a new body, taking on a new personality with each regeneration.

This video contains an integrated paid for advertorial with the wonderful Giorgio Armani beauty - I'm so pleased to be working with one of my most loved brands again! I thought the perfect way to show you the beautiful new Giorgio Armani Neo Nudes collection, along with some of my all time faves, would be to recreate Meghan's wedding makeup on the same day as the royal wedding itself. Watch along with me as I try to match Meghan's flawless, bridal look - I hope you love my interpretation! Congratulations to the happy couple, I hope your marriage is blessed with love and happiness ❤

Just a dude and his frisbee. I post mostly Sports videos with the occasional comedy video (or at least I think its a comedy)

4-time National Champion, 3 Guinness World Records, Amazing Race Season 28, throws frisbees into trash cans, basketball hoops, and pretty much anything a frisbee will fit in to. Always down to try new things and ideas, so please let me know what vids you want to see. More family-friendly content coming your way!

WELL FOLKS ITS THAT TIME OF YEAR WHERE WE TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK AND CHILL OUT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS THEN SIT BACK AND WATCH THE ILLS OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CRASH VIDEO !

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL MY SUBSCRIBERS AND FRIENDS FOR THEIR SUPPORT WITH OUR CHANNEL SINCE IT FIRST STARTED BACK IN 2009 !

WE CANNOT BELEIVE WE NOW HAVE SEVENTY THREE  THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS AND HAVE HAD OVER SEVENTY SIX  MILLION VIEWS AS WELL !!!!!!!! 
ALSO OF THE 2030 VIDEOS THAT WE HAVE UPLOADED THERE HAVE BEEN SEVENTY THOUSAND SHARES WORLD WIDE - WOW !

DEANO AND I HAVE HAD SUCH FUN WHILE FILMING AT THE RC SHOWS AND CLUBS HERE IN THE UK AND HAVE MADE MANY MANY NEW FRIENDS OVER THE PAST SEVEN SEASONS ITS BEEN QUITE HUMBLEING AT TIMES,

THE MOST HUMBLELING MOMENT OF ALL CAME AT THE WILLIS WARBIRDS FIGHTER MEET BACK IN JUNE WHEN UNBEKNOWN TO DEANO & I THE TWO TEDS - MATT HARROWVEN AND CHRIS WILLIS HAD ORGANISED A FUND ON FACE BOOK ASKING FELLOW MODDELLERS TO MAKE A DONATION TOWARDS UPGRADING ALL OF OUR COMPUTOR EQUIPMENT AND CAMERA AS A VERY BIG THANK YOU FOR ALL THE VIDEOS WE HAVE UPLOADED OF THESE GUYS & GIRLS OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS AT THESE SHOWS !

IT WAS SO HUMBLEING THAT I MIGHT HAVE CRIED SEVERAL TIMES DURING THAT AFTERNOON - LOL, 
AS IF THAT WASNT ENOUGH OF A SHOCK WHEN WE FINISHED FILMING ON THE FLIGHT LINE OF THE LMA ELVINGTON SHOW TWO WEEKS LATER DAVE & ANDY JOHNSON & KEN McCORMICK PRESENTED US WITH A CARD WITH MORE DONATIONS IN IT - GOBSMACKED AGAIN TO SAY THE LEAST, 

WE WERE THEN GIVEN SEVERAL CASH DONATIONS FROM MORE FRIENDS AND THE TOTAL DONATION FINALLY CAME OUT AT OVER £1650 !!!!!
WITH THIS MONEY WE BOUGHT TWO NEW MONITORS AND ALSO A TOWER COMPUTOR AND WILL UPGRADE THE VIDEO CAMERA SOON,

ANOTHER MILESTONE IN OUR RC HISTORY WOULD BE THAT OF DEANO BEING OFFERED A POSITION AS A DISPLAY PILOT IN THE AZAEROSPORTS DISPLAY TEAM THIS YEAR,

AND HE WAS ALSO OFFERED A SPONSORHIP FROM GP ENGINES (GREAT POWER ENGINES), 

ANOTHER MILESTONE FOR DEANO WAS THAT HE WON THE 3D FREESTYLE MASTER AEROBATIC COMPETITION BACK IN FEBUARY 2017,

AGAIN MANY MANY THANKS TO YOU ALL (TO MANY TO NAME) FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND GENEROSITY OVER THE YEARS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMING SEASON AND MANY MANY MORE -

How much money can you make in a day?
Let’s play
I got that Crypto Crypto Crypto
I got that Ripple Ripple Ripple
Yeah, I’m slangin’ Tron
All day long

And you better believe
I’m about to short some Bitcoin
Yeah, that’s right
I’ma go and short some Bitcoin
Every day and every night
Because right now its a Bearish market
There ‘aint nothing in sight

Where the money at? x8

VERSE

Listen up kids 
Stop yo clicks 
You gotta kick it with the da double dd y quick
If you want be a baller than you gotta do like this
You gotta short it while its hot and then you’re living like a pimp

Bitcoin bleeding with these things they calling Ripples
Buyin dippels. Sucking nippels. 
Tron living like a space age playa 
Cardano flingin’ paper. Home invada’

It’s Alt Season baby. Shit is scary.
Iota looking like a young Halle Berry 
Monero sneaking in like Mr. Steal yo girl
Lumenary Daddy stacking commas like they pearls. 

Im buyin’ and Im selling and I’m blowin’ up the servs’
Illuminati Cryptonati forking the whole world
I’m lightning fast and crypto rich so hot i start to burn
Too many coins to stop. Word.

Longing alts on Binance while Im shortin’ on the Mex
It hurts so bad to do this but I know its for the best
I sell into the fiat then I flip to BTC
What you thought I’d switched bitch? I’m fuckin CoinDaddy.

CHORUS

Hi, I'm Liv! I'm an Ohio girl living in a California world with my two dog babies and husband. I make videos on fashion, beauty, lifestyle, food, fitness, and overall health and wellness. Some of my favorite videos to make (that you'll see a lot!) are haul videos, lookbooks, try on videos, and style/beauty essentials. I LOVE to shop, socialize, hang out at the beach, and spread love & happiness. I believe life is too short to be anything other than your happiest self.

1.    Now that Black Panther is out, how long do you think it’ll be before Marvel decides to do a first Asian super hero movie?

2.    Will we see Natalie Portman return as Jane Foster to play Thor in a future Thor movie?

3.    I recently purchased a new DC Comics HC graphic novel called “Challengers Of The Unknown” by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. Could this be an ingenious title to adapt to screen? TV series or movie?

4.    Why doesn’t DC look to their stellar catalog of animated TV shows and films like JL: Unlimited, Batman Beyond: The Animated Series and all the recent decent movies like JL: War?

5.    Do you think we could get a Black Panther & Wakanda vs Namor & Atlantis in a future Black Panther sequel?

6.    What story do you think DC should have lead up to like Marvel did with Infinity War?

7.    I want to seriously start reading some comic books, but how do I find where a story arc starts?

8.    If/when we get a Hulk solo movie, who would you like to see as the villain?

9.    Do you think a Moon Knight TV series should tackle the Moench & Sienkiewicz run with Spector, Frenchie, and Bushman in Egypt, or should it find its own unique voice like Legion, The Punisher, and Black Lightning?

10.    Do you think the moustache thing was an over used criticism on JL?

11.    Is Hawkeye in Avengers: Infinity War?

12.    Is there a chance that they will use an unknown actor or stuntman to play Batman so he can just be a shadow-like figure for The Joker origin movie?

As Alex attempts to drop a huge wave, he falls off his board in a nasty wipeout, takes a ton of water on his head and loses his surfboard in the process. He manages to come to the surface quickly, but the next wave is already approaching, making it impossible for his team mate and professional Big Wave Surfer Hugo Vau, on the jetski, to pick him up. Alex now has to duck dive this huge wall of water before a rescue attempt is possible.

After the two first waves, Hugo Vau is finally able to rescue Alex with the jetski, and they now rush to the inside zone of Praia do Norte to find Alex’s surfboard. They need it before they can go back to the outside to catch more waves.
The Inside area of Praia do Norte is the most dangerous spot on the beach: waves can be unpredictable and terribly thick, the foamy white water makes it very difficult to manoeuvre the jet skis, and that's where most accidents happen.

When they finally find the surfboard, a rogue wave capsizes the jetski and both Hugo and Alex get dragged in different directions. Hugo finds himself relatively near the jet ski and tries to regain control as fast as he can, another huge wave approaches, and Hugo makes a decision that may have saved his life: he aborts the attempt to jump on the jetski and dives as deep as he can. A wise decision because the next wave breaks directly on top of the jetski and he most probably wouldn’t have survived the impact.

The action continues in the Inside, where Alex tries to regain control of the jet ski and once again things get complicated. At the end, the jetski gets to the sand, and both Hugo and Alex manage to get to dry land, unharmed. Against all odds, the jetski also ends with minor damages. 

Praia do Norte is incredibly dangerous at any size. The day this action took place was not the biggest of the season, yet, things can get really threatening, even with the most experienced watermen involved.  

Hugo Vau and Alex Botelho are no strangers to Nazaré, they are among the most skilled watermen in the world with many years of experience in Praia do Norte. 
Hugo Vau, 40 years old, is one of the first pioneers of Big Wave Surfing in Nazaré. He’s been part of Garrett McNamara’s team since the beginning of Nazaré's first explorations back in 2010. Hugo has been nominated for the WSL Biggest Wave Award several times, and has under his belt some of the biggest waves ever ridden on this beach. 
Alex Botelho, 27 years old, is currently the only Portuguese running on the WSL Big Wave Tour, amongst an elite crew that includes the best and most respected big wave surfers worldwide. Recently, Alex has been a standout among the Big Wave international scene, he has successfully paddled some of the most critical waves of the season, across all Continents.

Praia do Norte beach, near the fishing village of Nazaré, has become famous worldwide for huge waves in 2011, when Hawaiian surfer Garrett McNamara set a world-record for the largest wave ever surfed: 24 meters (78-foot).

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uUPephy-FPE/sddefault.jpg,0.01051106206705869,0.000226623020751559,46.381263616557725,0.0004330030265775974,0.010737685087810249,0.011170688114387844,2018-03-19,00:24:52,Monday,0,16,52,14,50,92,484,1,121,1,3,11,0,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.668811803493303,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

When I'm broken down and I'm bruised
I'm gonna get myself back home to you, ooh

And I need someone to lay down beside me
'Cause I can't sleep by myself
And my poor old heart's in five million pieces

I can't give up and I can't let go
I won't give up, I won't lose

The story begins with the Aztec God of death and lightning, the Xolotl. As legends have it, he was a monstrous dog that guarded the sun god and ushered souls to the underworld every night. One day, as Gods began sacrificing each other for the newly created sun, Xolotl, a master transformer, managed to escape death by turning himself into a salamander. And that creature came to be known as the axolotl.

북한 병사가 판문점 공동경비구역을 통해 귀순한 이후 북한에서도 후속 움직임이 포착되고 있습니다.

판문각을 지키는 경비대대가 교체되고 귀순 병사가 단숨에 건너온 72시간 다리도 폐쇄한 정황이 포착됐습니다.

취재기자 연결합니다. 김지선 기자!

북한이 72시간 다리를 폐쇄한 징후가 포착됐다고요?

[기자]
북한 측에서 JSA로 오는 길목에 사천이라는 천이 흐르는데 그걸 건너는 다리입니다.

유엔사령부의 CCTV로 실시간으로 볼 수 있는 곳인데, 현재 차량 이동이 거의 없는 것으로 전해졌습니다.

원래도 차량 이동이 드문 곳이기 때문에 평상시에도 차량이나 사람 이동하면 CCTV가 일일이 추적하고 그래서 차량이나 사람이 오가는 모습을 속속들이 파악할 수 있습니다.

72시간 다리는 북한에서 공동경비구역으로 향하는 유일한 관문이기 때문에 완전히 폐쇄됐다고 보긴 어렵고요.

일시적으로 폐쇄한 정황이 포착되긴 했지만 곧 출입통제 강화 조치, 통문이나 검색대 설치 등의 조치가 있을 것으로 보입니다.

유엔사가 공개한 CCTV 화면에도 나왔지만 북한군 병사가 모는 차량이 아무런 저지나 추격 없이 검문소를 통과해 1분 만에 건너는데요, 이런 허술한 경비를 보완하려는 움직임이 감지되는 겁니다.

[앵커]
당시 판문각을 지키던 북한군 병사도 교체됐다고요?

[기자]
군 당국은 판문각 경비대대가 교체된 정황을 포착한 것으로 전해졌습니다.

공동경비구역에서 서로 얼굴을 맞대고 있는 경비를 서기 때문에 경비대대의 교체는 공동경비구역 근무자라면 북한 측 경비대원의 교체가 육안으로도 구별이 가능합니다.

사건 당시 영상을 보면 북한군 경비대대가 귀순 병사를 향해 주저 없이 발포를 하지만 결국 눈앞에서 놓칩니다.

귀순 병사가 검문소를 지나쳐 다리를 건너온 후에야 판문각 경비대대 알아차리고 급하게 내려오는 모습도 고스란히 드러났습니다.

[앵커]
북한군 병사를 놓친 책임을 물어 징계를 받았다는 얘기도 들리는데요?

[기자]
징계까지는 아직 알 수 없지만 북한 체재 특성상 당연히 상응하는 조치가 있었을 것으로 보입니다.

고도의 긴장감이 응축된 공동경비구역에서 군용 지프를 이용한 일탈 행위가 4분 동안 아무 저지 없이 이어졌다는 것, 결국 귀순으로 이어진 점에 대해서 당연히 책임을 피하긴 어려울 것으로 보입니다.

최근 국정원은 군... (중략)

Subscribe to this channel to see the amazing food prepared in this small kitchen, and chew on some food for thought as well.

We can all benefit from redefining what ""enough"" looks like, and re-think what we think we ""need."" I work part time so I can live full time, and so can you. Maybe not to this extreme, but certainly downsize, minimize, and reevaluate some ""stuff."" It's possible to do all the things you SAY you wish you could do (volunteer more, read books, take yoga, breathe, cook, bake, hike, kayak, and lead a stress-free life in service to others). This is a tour of my RV followed by an explanation of my transition from a conventional lifestyle to being liberated and at peace. This isn't very different from renting a room in a friend's house, except it's significantly less intrusive. If you have more than enough, don't raise your standard of living, raise your standard of giving. Build a longer dining table, not a taller fence. Live simply so that others can simply live. Namaste.

When you get little, you want more. When you get more, you desire even more. But when you lose everything, you realize LITTLE was enough. _/|\_

Timber Hawkeye, bestselling author of Buddhist Boot Camp and Faithfully Religionless, prescribes gratitude as medicine for people to heal themselves from the inside out. His message invites the best version of you to resurface, inevitably leading to the true meaning of success (being happy), and better health (mental, physical, emotional and spiritual). In an ongoing effort to eradicate society's ever-growing sense of entitlement, which he considers nothing short of an epidemic, and replace it with a sense of appreciation for each breath we are given, Timber's intention is to awaken, enlighten, enrich and inspire, by sharing mindfulness-enhancing techniques that anyone can relate to and implement in their daily lives.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uXSrsX3-oPg/sddefault.jpg,0.016885107089085142,0.0012841661399857005,13.14869358669834,0.001409227450530626,0.018169273229070842,0.019578500679601464,2017-12-29,12:50:19,Friday,4,11,16,11,16,69,145,2,28,1,1,5,8,4,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.844483726539766,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'oven': 1, 'microwave': 2}",3

From Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television, A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE! is inspired by the holiday classic feature “A Christmas Story” and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway production “A Christmas Story: The Musical.” Marc Platt (“Grease: Live,” “La La Land,” “Wicked”) and Adam Siegel (“Grease: Live”) will executive-produce, with Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary (“Grease: Live,” “Anything but Love,” “Ira & Abby”) serving as co-executive producers and writers. Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “La La Land”) who composed the original score to “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” will compose several new songs for the LIVE television event on FOX.

Two-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick (“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “The Producers,” “Manchester by the Sea”) will star as the narrator where he will play the grown-up “Ralphie Parker,” who looks back with love and humor on his favorite childhood Christmas. Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker."" Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.

With his pants around his ankles, the tiny figurine can be found squatting and … well … pooping. Legend has it that in the 18th century, farmers defecated onto their land in order to fertilize the soil. Today, the tradition lives on in the form of the figurines, known as “caganers.” If you’re looking to add a pooping man to your own holiday celebrations, brothers Sergi and Marc Alos are your guys. They’ve made a booming business across Catalonia keeping the centuries old tradition alive.

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_2GjbvrX7w/sddefault.jpg,0.017771430007455367,0.00017172487162518744,103.48780487804878,0.0009667946378134893,0.017943154879080558,0.018909949516894047,2018-03-12,00:10:42,Monday,0,16,59,14,57,94,541,1,130,1,3,11,0,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.805955444961701,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

All these tens and they bad and they texting my phone
So what if you through

Pre Hook - Thought I was winning but losing,
Made you feel dumb for accusing
I know my love was confusing
But Who did I think I was fooling
So guess what I, I think u should do, give me a taste of my own medicine.

Hook - I wouldn’t like it if you did the things I do, put me on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
Gone and ride him crazy, it ain’t nothing I can do
Gave all of these girls everything that belongs to you
So Gone and call up Bryan, I ain’t mad at Ryan, when u text Lorenzo, i might end up crying

Learn about directing a film in Ron Howard’s first-ever online class. The two-time Academy Award winner has directed some of the most beloved movies of all time, including Splash, Parenthood, Apollo 13, and A Beautiful Mind, Ron Howard shares techniques that have made him one of the most respected filmmakers in Hollywood.

In his MasterClass, Ron Howard deconstructs the craft of directing, offering practical, hands-on tips for both aspiring and experienced filmmakers. Learn how he evaluates scripts, casts actors, works with writers and cinematographers, blocks scenes, and collaborates with his crew. Ron believes that directing is a teachable craft, and he brings decades of experience—both in front of and behind the camera—to his class.

Ron breaks down the process of directing, sharing relatable advice grounded in lessons from decades of work in Hollywood. He directs actors and camera operators through a Frost/Nixon scene to represent three different ways to stage a scene: a feature film, Steadicam, and run-and-gun. You will get a rare firsthand glimpse into exactly how Ron makes each decision as he directs.

Ron Howard’s MasterClass will open your eyes to the hands-on process of telling a story through film, from pre- to post-production, with 20+ video chapters and a customized workbook tailored to each lesson. In this online class, Ron Howard teaches how to:
Serve and advance the story
Deconstruct iconic scenes
Find and work with key collaborators
Cast and work with actors
Work with editors
Always work in the service of the story

I think everybody feels this way but there's just something so magical about this time of year? Like idk something about December is so........sparkly haha +｡:.ﾟヽ(*´∀`)ﾉﾟ.:｡+ﾟ

Fun fact my favorite thing is GIFTING which is another reason why I love Christmas ^-^ I can't vlog me buying gifts though because idk who's watching ¬_¬

I really want to travel somewhere to see snow this winter. I actually have seen snow irl when my family was driving through a state but I've never touched snow （ｉДｉ）

I hope you all are having a wonderful December! Remember to dress in layers if you are further up north ˙˚ʚ(´◡`)ɞ˚˙

Get ready to sing and dance, laugh and love all over again.

Ten years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA. With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film. Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker. Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers. Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.

Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna. Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful). Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).

As of now, Sony's Playstation 4 has sold over 70 million units and is on track to sell more units than any of the three major consoles of the previous generation did by the end of this year. 

It may not catch up to the Playstation 2's 155 million, but it will almost certainly do the next best thing and outsell the original Playstation's 103 million by the end of this generation. Microsoft's answer to the PS4, the Xbox One, sits somewhere around 30 million, which isn't terrible in a vacuum, but when compared to Sony's numbers it appears dismal.

Turkey and Yemen: draft resolution

Status of Jerusalem

The General Assembly,

Reaffirming its relevant resolutions, including resolution 72/15 of 30 November 2017 on Jerusalem,

Reaffirming also the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, 252 (1968) of 21 May 1968, 267 (1969) of 3 July 1969, 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 March 1980, 476 (1980) of 30 June 1980, 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980 and 2334 (2016) of 23 December 2016, 

Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming, inter alia, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,

Bearing in mind the specific status of the Holy City of Jerusalem and, in particular, the need for the protection and preservation of the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of the city, as foreseen in relevant United Nations resolutions,

Stressing that Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations in line with relevant United Nations resolutions,

Expressing, in this regard, its deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem,

1. Affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and in this regard calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem, pursuant to Security Council resolution 478 (1980);

2. Demands that all States comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions; A/ES-10/L.22 2/2 17-22856

3. Reiterates its call for the reversal of the negative trends on the ground that are imperilling the two-State solution and for the intensification and acceleration of international and regional efforts and support aimed at achieving, without delay, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid terms of reference, including the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative 1 and the Quartet road map,2 and an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967;

4. Decides to adjourn the tenth emergency special session temporarily and to authorize the President of the General Assembly at its most recent session to resume its meeting upon request from Member States.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ucSXD7XWHpg/hqdefault.jpg,0.009805623047552932,0.00204790003471017,4.788135593220339,0.004512322110378341,0.011853523082263106,0.016365845192641445,2017-12-21,17:25:10,Thursday,3,8,7,8,7,47,68,0,19,1,1,5,3,2,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0462742086426875,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"{'laptop': 1, 'bottle': 1, 'person': 2}",4

Unhealthy Snacks, Snacks In Between Meals | Sanne Vloet

Hey Guys!

So we all know that feeling of craving something yummy and snacking during the day and night! After my first two food videos I decided to make a separate video to show you what I personally like to snack when I am hungry.  I think it is very important to snack in between your meals so you get some extra energy and it stimulates your metabolism. These healthy snacks are great for on the go- a movie night or when you are just hanging at home. 

Let me know if you guys recommend any other delicious goodies and I hope you enjoy the video! 

X Sanne

Bruno Mars was one of the most heavily favored artist heading into this Sundays show, he was nominated in all three of the major Grammy categories, Album of the year, record of the year, and song of the year and guess what he just won all 3, but are you really surprised? With an album titled 24K Magic, it makes sense that he would sweep the Grammys and take home ALL the gold. Allow me to break down some stats just in case some haters have something to say.
Bruno took home the Grammy for Song of the Year which recognizes the songwriter and the tune didn’t need long to rise into the top 10 on the Hot 100, where it ended up residing for 28 weeks, making it one of the longest-running top 10 hits of all-time, the track spent a single week at No. 1  and it became the singer’s 7th chart topper.
Bruno shared the honor with his collaborators who joined him on stage to accept his award.
Shortly after that win, Bruno accepted the award for Record of the Year for his hit song, 24K Magic. This is the second time that Bruno has one for record of the year. Previously, he took home the award for ‘Uptown Funk’. In his speech he called the award show producers out for cutting him off on his last speech and then proceeded to thank those who helped make this record possible and in a really sweet moment, he thanked his Dad.
And finally, Bruno Mars anxiously waited to find out if he would be taking home the award for Album of the Year.  He had insane competition including Kendrick Lamar’s (DAMN.), Lorde’s (Melodrama), Childish Gambino’s (""Awaken, My Love!"") and Jay-Z’s (4:44)!
Bruno ultimately took home the award and was clearly shocked that he won. He began his speech telling the other nominees that they are the reason why he pulls his hair out in the studio because he knows that they are going to come through with the top shelf artistry and music. He then begins to tell a story about his job at 15 performing in a show and how performing those songs impacted this album. 
We have to say a huge congrats to Bruno Mars, but the internet definitely had mixed reactions. Many upset because of the particular artists and albums that he won over. I’ll let you dive into Twitter to see what people had to say about that, but in the meantime what do you guys think? Are you happy that Bruno Mars won all of his awards, but specifically album of the year? And if not who did you want to win? Let us know in the comment section below and then click right over here to see me breakdown Bruno Mars and Cardi B’s insane performance of Finesse! Thanks for watching our Grammy Coverage.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

Keeping the momentum at full throttle with another red hot Revealed Recordings offering to be released via 'Hardwell & Friends Vol 3', Hardwell unveils the heated 'Take Us Down (Feeding The Hunger) which is set for a January 26th release.

With Dr Phunk's previous remix pedigree on tracks such as 'Apollo' 'Nothing Can Hold Us Down', 'Run Wild' and 'Young Again', his proven track record of delivering fresh and unique material for the imprint takes centre stage once more.

Teaming up in Hardwell's Breda based studio, they join forces again after their revered collaboration 'Here Once Again' which dropped on the second volume of Hardwell & Friends. Following a club centric, dancefloor driven approach, 'Take Us Down' fits supremely in what's shaping up to be another unforgettable edition of Hardwell & Friends!

According to one Ukrainian analyst: “It sounds like an agreement between criminal bosses. You can sign it with your blood.” 

The scheme involves using a web of offshore companies and international lawyers to raid US$160 million dollars under the noses of the authorities. 

The money is effectively being stolen for a second time… the funds were initially frozen by Ukraine’s courts after its former president, Viktor Yanukovych, was discovered to have emptied the country’s treasury. 

The Oligarchs include an exiled gas billionaire guarded by Russian special forces, a Moscow property magnate and an Olympic show jumper on the run from Ukrainian authorities. 

The investigation shines light on the ever shifting battle between the oligarchs and global financial regulators.

It is with heavy hearts that we report the loss of famed DJ and producer, Tim Bergling who many know as Avicii. His rep released a statement saying QUOTE - “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii. He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th.  The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”
In 2016 he made the shocking announcement that he would be retiring from live performing due to health reasons. In addition to having his gallbladder and appendix removed back in 2014, he also suffered from acute pancreatitis for several years. Just last year he posted a statement on his website saying QUOTE - “WE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US. For me it’s creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do. Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music. Instead, I went back to the place where it all made sense – the studio. The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new. Hope you´ll enjoy it as much as I do.”
Avicii was a highly decorated artist who’d won several awards including an American Music Award, Billboard,Echo, iHeart, MTV Europe Music Awards and many more as well as garnered several nominations including Grammys over the years.  His final performance was in Ibiza on August 28th 2016 at the White Isle where he held a five year residency. It was just announced on Tuesday that Avicii was nominated for a 2018 Billboard Music Award and took to Twitter to voice his gratitude saying – “Thanks for the nomination! @billboard #BBMAS.”

1) Will Fantastic Four rights land with Disney if sale goes through?

2) Guillermo del Toro Set to Direct ‘Nightmare Alley’ Remake; Will Produce Scott Cooper’s ‘Antlers’

3) Woody Harrelson in Talks to Join Tom Hardy in ‘Venom’

4) Jennifer Lawrence to Star in Icelandic Drama ‘Burial Rites’ for ‘Call Me by Your Name’ Director

5) Joe Johnston to Direct Disney's 'Nutcracker and the Four Realms' Reshoots

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

In a thorough write up from Screen Rant, the site has broken down the potential Disney/Fox merger revealing that the rights to the Fantastic Four could be separate from Disney’s acquisition. The specifics go all the way back to 1986 when Stan Lee licensed the property to Constantin Films, famously leading to a doomed adaptation directed by Roger Corman. In 1999, Constantin formed a partnership with Fox to approach Marvel with a deal in which they agreed that Fox and Constantin collectively share the movie rights. Now the question becomes who owns the rights.

Variety reports that Fox Searchlight has ramped up development on two projects from Oscar shoe-in Guillermo del Toro. Sources for the trade reveal Searchlight is in negotiations with Hostiles director Scott Cooper to direct the supernatural pic Antlers, which del Toro is producing, while del Toro himself is attaching himself to write and direct a remake of the 1947 movie Nightmare Alley.

BUY OR SELL

In a report from Variety, Woody Harrelson has signed on to join Tom Hardy, Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams, and Jenny Slate in Sony’s Spider-Man spin-off Venom. The actor reunites with his Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer, in a part that is being kept under wraps – only described by Variety as a henchman of sorts.

Variety reports that Call Me by Your Name director Luca Guadagnno will direct Jennifer Lawrence in a new movie entitled Burial Rites. Lawrence will produce, as well as star in the true-crime drama based on the novel by the same name; which centers on Agnes Magnusdottir, the last woman to be publicly executed in Iceland in 1830.

In a report from THR, Disney Studios has enlisted Captain America The First Avenger director Joe Johnston to direct 32 days of reshoots for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, originally directed by Lasse Hallstrom. Insiders for THR say that Hallstrom, known for dramas such as What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, Cider House Rules and A Dog’s Purpose, has not been removed but rather was unavailable due to scheduling issues.

It’s barely been a week since the 2018 Winter Olympics started and the US has already racked up three gold medals and their latest addition was all thanks to Chloe Kim. While the 17-year-old from Long Beach, California started making headlines for her incredible skills, amazing performance, and essentially being the youngest female snowboarder to win an Olympic medal, it didn’t take long for people to notice her hangry tweets and say #relatable.
You guys, I’m not kidding when I say Chloe is literally us.
It all started in the middle of runs at the qualifying round of the women’s Olympic snowboarding half-pipe competition, Chloe hopped on Twitter to let everyone know just what she was in the mood for. Chloe tweeted, “Could be down for some ice cream rn.” And about a day before her ice cream tweet, she gave some pretty solid churro advice by telling people that if they “ever get nervous, go eat a churro.”
I mean, who doesn’t eat churros when they’re nervous? Or any junk food for that matter, am I right?
On TOP of those food-related tweets, Chloe tweeted shortly before her win QUOTE, “Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now I’m getting hangry.” Girl, same.
But Chloe’s relatable hangry tweets wasn’t the only thing that caught the public’s eye. During her competition, many people caught sight of Chloe’s dad cheering her on with a homemade, LAMINATED sign and it’s safe to say there wasn’t a dry eye in the world.
Seriously, how could you not get emotional after seeing an adorable and loving sign?!
Not to mention in an interview with Today’s Hoda Kotb, Chloe’s dad – who is an immigrant by the way -- called her his ‘AMERICAN DREAM.’ Okay, somebody get me some tissues because I am CRYING.
So, what did you guys think of all this? Were you surprised to know that junk food is a part of an Olympian’s DIET? Because I was. Anyway, let me know all your thoughts on everything Chloe – including her adorable dad in the comment section below. When you’re done with that, click right over here to get all the deets on the historical triple axel that was completed during the Winter Olympics. Thanks for watching, I’m your girl Drew Dorsey and I’ll see ya next time!

Fire ants, black crazy ants, yellow crazy ants and now these Polyrhachis ants: Time and time again, the keeping of ants has made for some really unique revelations into the natural world around us. Today we make some really amazing scientific discoveries and finally answer the questions: Where did our Polyrhachis ants disappear to, and what was that mysterious mist seen floating on El Dragon's waters last week?

Alright what's going on guys it's Trev back again here to bring you my review for this weeks episode of The Walking Dead Season 8.  This week we got to see the premiere for the walking dead season 8 mid-season finale, episode 8 - How it's gotta be.

So this was a pretty loaded, extended episode for the walking dead.  Major spoilers to follow.

Eclipsing everything else in the episode we see the death of a major A lister in the series, Carl Grimes who has been bitten.  This was a pretty crazy reveal for fans of the series since he has been a lead since the very beginning and a lot of us were not expecting to see this happen at this stage of the series.

We also see Negan and the saviors make a pretty significant comeback against the joint survivors including destroying Alexandria.

Dwight becomes a full on survivor and helps out the survivors significantly once more.  We also learn that it was Eugene who helped to free the saviors and we see Rick re-united with Michonne and Carl in what seems like his last moments.


I am going to give this week's episode a 9.6 out of 10.  This was a pretty ambitious mid-season finale.  

As always, thanks for watching everyone!

LYRICS DOLOR DE CABEZA

Mirando el celular chequeando sin parar / No me respondes nada o esto me anda mal
Yo reconfirmo que mi texto te llegó / También confirmo que tú me estás ignorando
Y luego de unos días de un silencio atroz / Recibo un corazón y un mensaje de voz
Como que entre los dos nada nada pasó / Y ahora yo siento que esto se está complicando

Y luego tú me haces pasar por ti / Y en tu puerta recibo un texto y dice “estoy durmiendo”
Y cuando vuelvo a ver lo más extraño es que / A mi aquí me figura que tú sigues escribiendo

Yo todo lo que quiero es invitarte a bailar / pasearnos de la mano por toda la ciudad
me esquivas y me evitas con delicadeza / y la excusa de hoy es un dolor de cabeza
SerÍa tan divertido que salgamos tÚ y yo / primero dices si luego me dices que no
tú vienes y te vas con tanta sutileza / y la excusa de hoy es un dolor de cabeza
De cabeza de cabeza / Dime amor que no te duele la cabeza la cabeza

De nuevo mi pantalla se vuelve a encender / Me dices que a las siete nos podremos ver
Te digo “dime donde” yo allí estaré / Y me dejas colgado sin una respuesta

Y luego tú me haces pasar por ti / Y en tu puerta recibo un texto y dice “estoy durmiendo”
Y cuando vuelvo a ver lo más extraño es que / A mi aquí me figura que tú sigues escribiendo

chorus

Porque será que siempre pasa así / Y nunca muestras ni un poquito de arrepentimiento
Y vuelve a suceder es una y otra vez / No sé por que razón es que te sigues escondiendo

chorus

On this episode of Breaking Trail, witness the EPIC conclusion of Coyote Peterson’s climb up the insect sting pain index!

What started as a simple curiosity with Harvester Ant stings has now evolved and captured the worlds attention in one mans quest to document the most painful insect stings from around the globe. Now in what may be his final pain index challenge ever, Coyote takes on the infamous sting of none other than the Warrior Wasp!

The Warrior Wasp, a beautiful iridescent blue paper wasp, lives in the dense jungles of Central and South America. Their stunning appearance is well complemented by their elaborate nests that adorn the rainforest canopies and can house hundreds of these winged insects. However don’t let their beauty fool you, these speedy wasps pack a seriously powerful punch that can cause major injury and even death when swarmed in high numbers.

Now the time has come for Coyote to return to home of the Bullet Ant to be stung by a Warrior Wasp! Will it be his worst and take the throne atop the sting index?

Get ready to find out!

Hard to top Djawadi's version of ""Paint it Black,"" but with time this may just do it. So much fun to play, I'm looking forward to doing a live cover of it soon!

OBSESSED 
VS
Baby you got something special 
Your body is a work of art
But we got a little issue
I feel your chest but I can’t find your heart
 
Got more muscles than the ocean,
Sculpted like an ancient God,
Full of yourself but no emotion,
I like to touch but I can’t feel no love
 
PRE
You’re looking in my eyes just to see your own
See your own reflection, 
You’re own reflection
 
Your body’s overpriced 
‘Cause you pay yourself way too much attention
Too much attention
 
CH
You’re so obsessed with yourself,
Maybe you should undress with yourself,
Hey
Get a table for two,
Your ego and you,
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself
Obsessed with yourself
 
VS
Baby likes your ladies special,
Picture perfect beauty belles,
Only looking surface level,
That’s if you can take your eyes off yourself, 
 
Gonna end up with nobody
Even though we form a line,
But I don’t even think you’re worried 
If you’ve got a mirror, baby you’re fine,
 
PRE
You’re looking in my eyes just to see your own
See your own reflection, 
Your own reflection 
Your body’s overpriced 
‘Cause you pay yourself way too much attention
Too much attention
 
CH
You’re so obsessed with yourself,
Maybe you should undress with yourself,
Get a table for two,
Your ego and you,
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself
Obsessed with yourself
 
x 2
 
BR
Do it baby like you do,
I love it and I hate it too
Do it baby like you do,
‘Cause i’m obsessed with myself too

In this video, we are gonna talk about Pistols in Ghost War. I went ahead and divided the operators into 3 health categories. Point, Disruptor, and Tech were in a 140% Health category. The tank is in the 225% Health Category. The Support, Marksman, Assassin, and Multiclass are in their own category with 100-110% Health. I tested each pistol and wanted to see how many shots it would take from 30-40 meters to kill these 3 categories of operators. Then I took all the shots from the categories I tested and added them up to equal total shots. Then, I took the results and came up with the Top 3 Pistols. Hopefully you guys enjoyed the video and don't forget to drop a like on it!

European Parliament delegation to the Budgetary Conciliation Committee

Transcript:

Let’s hear it for Commission Oettinger, the German Commissioner in charge of the European Union budget, you sir are having a very good day. Christmas has come early. You must be delighted the British Government is going to shell out a cool 50 billion as part of our exit proceedings, which if you think about it is all really rather odd isn’t it because the 23rd of June 2016 wasn’t just significant politically, it was significant for the European Union budget. We’ve been a net contributor into the EU budget every single year since 1973, for most of those years we’ve been the second biggest contributor and we pay in 16 percent of the total EU budget but of course we’re leaving.

So logic says, if for example a family has an annual income and that income declines they then have cheaper holidays, they then cut their cloth according to their circumstances and yet when we look at the 2018 budget all the Commission projections going on for the next few years we see that absolutely no account is being taken of the British leaving the EU. You’ve decided to simply carry on regardless and it would appear in a very weak moment the British Prime Minister has decided to bail you out for it.

Well I would just say don’t bank on it because I think there is going to be a huge public reaction to this extraordinary sum of money, honestly I do. I think there is a real prospect of there being a big rebellion in the Conservative party against their own leader, so don’t think this is absolutely guaranteed. Certainly the line that I’ve always taken is that no deal is better than a bad deal and in this case it’s worse than a bad deal, we don’t even know if we’re going if we’re going to get a trade deal in return. Even if there was a firm offer of tariff free access to the EU Single Market it would not be worth the 50 billion payment so celebrate for today Commissioner but I promise you it’s not in the bag.

Blue Card response:

The fact that the Office for Budget Responsibility is giving a bearish prognosis for the UK economy doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re right.  You know we had lots of people, lots of big organisations telling us that if we didn’t join the euro we’d be heading for ruin and thank God we didn’t do it. Yes I am aware of the extent to which our money recycled through the European Union comes back to British universities and some of it comes back to be very well spent in research and I acknowledge that, I understand that. But equally much of it comes back to fund things like Jean Monnet professorships in British Universities to teach a completely slanted, distorted view of history. We’d rather spend the money ourselves thank you sir.

Remember that your equipment & electricity supply may differ from the equipment shown in the video so your results may vary. Use 3rd party equipment at your own risk as Nintendo will only provide support for licensed products.

Me and my mate James are heading to the Philippines to travel for 3 weeks, but does it live up to the hype?

We're planning to check out 5 different islands: Manila, Boracay, Cebu, Siargau and Palawan, and hopefully find out if it really is more fun in the Philippines.

Highlights of this travel documentary include partying at Mad Monkey Hostel in Boracay, swimming with whale sharks in Oslob, Cebu, checking out the Aguinid Falls, canyoning at Kawasan falls, exploring Siargao Island and island hopping around El Nido.

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

JUSTICE LEAGUE REVIEW:
https://www.geek.com/movies/moviebob-reviews-justice-league-2017-1722863/

Yeah, it's bad. You already knew that. But how did something get THIS bad?

How does a project with so much at stake go so wrong in such a profound, all-encompassing way? At moment when the comic-book superhero genre is at its zenith, BATMAN V SUPERMAN was seemingly holding a winning hand: A celebrated, stylish director. A powerhouse cast. 80+ years worth of cherished American pop-mythology to draw from. Some of the most popular characters of all time. Dumptrucks full of Warner Bros' money to spend. And on top of all that, a moviegoing public hungry enough for an alternative to the Marvel Cinematic Universe formula for a pitch like ""depressing, ultra-violent, pitch-dark 9/11-themed SUPERMAN movie"" to sound (almost) like a good idea.

And yet, the end result was among the great cinematic calamities of the last decade; receiving scathing reviews, a near record-setting box-office dropoff, enraged notices from many fans and sarcastic ""thank you's"" from people named Martha. Even today, the shockwave from the film's negative reception are being felt as the studio continues to reshuffle the slate of films it was meant to inspire, JUSTICE LEAGUE continues to be transformed in post-production and the word ""reboot"" begins to fill the air. While not unprofitable or without its own unironic fans, the film seems destined to go down as one of the most infamous releases in the history of the genre.

In PART 3, we close out on a close look at director Zack Snyder's career and relationship to the superhero genre and ask whether or not there was ever a chance for this project to work out, if the DCEU franchise it was meant to establish can still be salvaged and look into the future of the superhero genre itself.

Lyrics:

Judy never asked her for forever
Judy never asked her for the moon
Judy knew that loving her was better
And no one knew her heart like Judy

Judy’s never mentioned in the papers
Judy’s never noted in the news
Judy knew that loving her was safer
Loving from the red side of the moon

Loving you from the red side of the moon
Loving her was funnier than a Saturday cartoon
Someday is a story and it’s the one I’m sticking to
Loving from the red side of the moon

Judy grew up stepping right beside her
Loved her from the cover of the crowds
Judy’s heart was beating right beside her
Even with the music loud and

Judy’s never minded all the waiting
Judy never thought to watch the clock
Judy knew that loving’s in the patience
When the red side of the moon is what we’ve got

Loving you from the red side of the moon
Loving her was easier than a Kristofferson tune
Someday is a story and it’s the one I’m sticking to
Loving from the red side of the moon

Judy left her best days in Chicago
Judy had her worst days in the rain
Middle of the winter with so far to go
And she couldn’t keep on hitching to that train

And she still listens to the radio
Late night after midnight she tunes in
Sings along to songs and every word she knows
Remembering when the moon was burning red

Loving you from the red side of the moon
Loving her was heavier than a leaded red balloon
Someday is a story and it’s the one I’m sticking to
Loving from the red side of the moon

PATREON SUPPORTER Puneet Singh - Hi John! I am too hopping on your ""Not doubting the Jurassic World"" train as I just heard that the review embargo for Fallen Kingdom, lift 17 days before release. That is some great faith in the movie. What are your thoughts? Thanks and keep up the great work!

Heath Hassel - Hey John love your show, my question is with talks of Sylvester Stallone doing a new Expendables movie and a Rambo movie especially with the last Expendables having a low box office, do you think Stallone is planning for retirement and just trying to get a couple more movies out, or do you think these will be actual hits...I am a fan of both franchises.

Adam Langevin -  I just saw A Quiet Place last night and I absolutely loved it. I thought the acting, filming, and sound design of it was phenomenal. Do you feel it has any Oscar chances? What would you like to see it win? The situation of a generally comedic actor directing a thriller seems to resemble 2017's Get Out.

Gravity Max was the world's first tilt coaster, and was created by Vekoma. The twin track duelling Tilt Coaster, Battle of the Jungle King was built by Golden Horse.

Be aware there is a maximum weight limit for riders on this coaster, if you weigh more than 80kg they will not allow you to ride. They have scales to check your weight if there is any doubt. 

An article has suggested that Vekoma are building another Tilt Coaster, this time at Energylandia in Poland.

In this video, I share their responses with you.

I got curious about why so many brands of strike anywhere matches had been discontinued after looking for -- and having trouble finding -- some brands for an article I was writing for the site.

I did some research and ended up on forum threads where people were making unsubstantiated claims...such as saying the Patriot Act had made them illegal.

Unsatisfied with these theories, I decided to email a couple manufacturers myself.

The emails I got back were illuminating, and I share them with you in this video because I believe they answer the question of why so many brands of strike anywhere matches (Ohio Blue Tips, Penley, UCO) have been discontinued.

Taboo explained that the song reflects themes and sentiments found in their Marvel graphic novel 'Masters of the Sun: The Zombie Chronicles.' Will was also inspired to write the track after watching the Netflix documentary 13TH, which explores lingering racial inequalities in the United States.

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

MY VLOG SERIES - A SNEAK PEAK INTO HOLLYWOOD AND BEHIND THE SCENES:
I also have a VLOG series where I take you behind the scenes from when I meet with Hollywood stars at different interview locations and give you a little sneak peak of what it's like to interview some of Hollywoods biggest stars. In my VLOGS I also take you to premieres, Hollywood parties, premiere after-parties, red carpets, The Oscars, The Golden Globes - and travels to film festivals, like Toronto, Cannes and Venice, comic-con in San Diego, as well as the typical film junket. I share some of my favorite interview tricks, some amazing, funny moments, but also some of my bloopers and less proud or awkward moments. So please come along for the ride behind the scenes in Hollywood, and don’t hesitate to ask questions or leave comments in the description section. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

This is Why I Hate NBA Refs, just check ,out one of the Worst Calls in NBA History feat, Joey Crawford 

I present you: 
WORST CALLS BY NBA REFS COMPILATION

Nowadays the Refs are just not doing their job right. Last Night Manu Ginobili threw the lob pass to LaMarcus Aldridge , but luckily the ball went straight in the basket and that should easily be a valid 3- point made shot,but Michael Beasley grabbed the rebound and just dribbled to the Spurs' hoop without inbounding the ball, everyone was shocked how the game continued and how the refs didn't see the clean basket from Manu, another example is the travels that refs don't call every NBA game, can you believe it ? And with the new rule for technical fouls and the expensive tickets for NBA games the refs just can't call right 

Musical Beat in the beginning and the end :

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Rihanna’s new makeup line Fenty Beauty has been an instant success — and it’s not only popular because Rihanna’s name is attached to it. Fenty Beauty carries a wide range of foundations — 40 to be exact — which has the beauty industry shook. Cosmetics and the beauty industry as a whole, has a long history of creating products that did not match deeper-toned people of color. There are a number of factors that have lead many mainstream beauty companies to having a narrow selection for people of color — and not all of those reasons are rooted in product development. With Fenty Beauty, Rihanna is showing the industry that it’s worth investing money and time into creating nuanced products beyond the ranges of ivory, beige, and tan.

Description:
Being a sports announcer is one of the coolest jobs out there. You’re paid six to 7 figures to call the biggest sporting events on national television. And heck, you can make an epic sports moment even more great if you can call it properly.

Unfortunately, some of the best sports moments of all-time were ruined by terrible commentary. I’m DeQwan Young, and today we present 10 times where the announcer ruined a great game.

And a big shoutout to JasonPorchVideos for suggesting this idea to us!

A big thanks to the awesome crew at the Gravity Discovery Centre in Gingin for letting us use their 45m leaning tower for our own experiments. If you wanna head out there and check it out, it's not far from Perth. Western Australia: http://gravitycentre.com.au/leaning-tower/

We are passionate about seeing children released from poverty and we would love you to consider sponsoring a child with Compassion. We visited our sponsor children in the Philippines and were blown away by the difference that child sponsorship can make.

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Call of Duty WW2 VS Battlefield 1 - Attention to Detail

Hi Guys ,
    In this Video i compared details between call of duty ww2 and battlefield 1 . I am huge fan of both of these franchises .These details do not make one game better than the other . But i have to admit it in details category battlefield 1 is the winner . personally i like call of duty ww2 over battlefield 1 in gameplay .

I am not good in english . I may made some mistake sorry for that.

Thanks for watching.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8UN8hCRxGs/sddefault.jpg,0.01769927856327036,0.002068341896569047,8.557230597431602,0.0057103636131965825,0.01976762045983941,0.02547798407303599,2018-01-22,15:13:58,Monday,0,11,81,11,38,55,516,1,67,2,2,5,3,2,5,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.109372781718728,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

What began as a simple flash video would become one of the earliest viral internet videos ever created. Jason Windsor’s ‘The End of the World’ (or “End of Ze World” as it quickly became known) was never meant to end up on the internet, until Jason discovered someone else posted it to eBaum's World one day in 2003.

Since, it’s made its way to YouTube and around the web, gaining millions of views and creating catchphrases that have become apart of internet slang well before the rise of the hashtag. VICE meets up with Jason to hear his story behind creating ‘The End of the World’ and the sequel 15-years in the making: “End of Ze World.. Probably for Real this Time.”

Ze End!

Subscribe for future updates on other major corporate facilities.

This is an extended length video, it's only a matter of time until the campus becomes shut-off to drones completely... with a geo-fence, or something similar. Security at Apple Park generally responds in two white Prius's to my precise take-off locations in 10 minutes or less. While this is speculation, my instincts tell me that Apple is tracking all drones in the vicinity of the campus with sophisticated radio frequency technology from companies such as DeDrone (a San Francisco-based aerospace security company). As always, I respect all requests by Apple Security to land my drone and leave the area when asked to do so. They are always asking if I'm an Apple employee too. So to all of the Apple Employees watching (and reading), don't fly your drones over The Park, it's frowned upon!

This cheaper and quicker method also provided the middle class with a means for memorializing dead loved ones.

Post-mortem photography was very common in the nineteenth century when ""death occurred in the home and was quite an ordinary part of life. These photographs served as keepsakes to remember the deceased. This was especially common with infants and young children; Victorian era childhood mortality rates were extremely high, and a post-mortem photograph might have been the only image of the child the family ever had.

Pictures.
Fuelled by his restored faith in humanity, and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists newfound ally Diana Prince to face an even greater threat. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly-awakened enemy. Despite the formation of an unprecedented league of heroes in Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash, it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.
With an estimated production budget of $300 million, Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made. The film grossed $657 million worldwide against a break-even point of $750 million, the highest-grossing film (as of 2019) to become a box office bomb, losing the studio an estimated $60 million.

Star Wars Ep. 8 The Last Jedi is getting praised by critics but mixed reactions from fans. What is the hidden agenda of The Last Jedi that makes it the boldest, most surprising, and most polarizing Star Wars film? Erik Voss explains the deeper meaning of The Last Jedi, how it connects every storyline, and how the Finn & Rose storyline on Canto Bight feels removed from the rest of the film. Is The Last Jedi too long? What is the significance of the film's final scene? Is it fair to say Rian Johnson betrayed J.J. Abrams vision in The Force Awakens, and George Lucas' vision of the characters in Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back... and is that a good thing?

It seems like most of the news about the British royal family focuses on the children of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and the relationship between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. But you probably know that there are a ton of other branches on their family tree, and today we’re going to tell you all about them. You know that Queen Elizabeth is the matriarch, and is married to Prince Philip, but how many children do the two of them have? Here’s a hint: it’s more than just Prince Charles. We’ll also let you know who’s next up in terms of succession, and which princesses will probably never get to sit on the throne. There’s a new rule at play which means that women of the royal family now get to hang onto their spots, despite the birth of male relatives. Do you think that this is a good thing or not? Tell us what you think in the comment section and don’t forget to subscribe for the latest videos from TheTalko.

We first learn about a scientific study in which moms watched their teens play a driving game, which had an interesting impact on their risk-taking behavior. Then we switch over to TV moms, like Lorelai Gilmore and Marge Simpson, with a bunch of quick facts. We explore the unique habits of moms from the animal kingdom. And of course, we learn the history of Mother's Day itself. Finally, we help you pick out Mother's Day flowers.

Would the adrenaline scene from Pulp Fiction actually play out that way? Is all that medical jargon we hear in shows like Grey's Anatomy and House true-to-life? Is removing a bullet really a cure-all for a gunshot wound?

Correction: We misidentified the type of worm in the Grey's Anatomy episode at 5:23! It was actually Ascaris lumbricoides,not Strongyloides

READ: https://archiveofourown.org/works/14729015/chapters/34045871

Any coin has two sides. Oliver's memories about the distant summer of 1983 and what happened later, written by Oliver himself.

Dedication: To André Aciman - heroes’ creator, Luca Guadagnino, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer – those who brought them to life.

As the book and the movie differ considerably from each other, the author was inspired with the book. Everything added by the author does not deviate from it. The movie events are considered only if they don’t contradict the book.

Music: Hello - Adele (Boyce Avenue piano acoustic cover) https://youtu.be/LWgqWuJG5Jg

About Damon and Jo:

It’s Damon. It’s Jo. And It’s Damon and Jo. Ok so look, we got tired of all the boring, predictable lifestyle and travel content out there, so we took matters into our own hands and started filming our travels, and adventures around the globe, in 5+ languages.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIyFJUmPZys/sddefault.jpg,0.008959010544676127,0.000124588010102955,71.9090909090909,0.0002114220777504691,0.009083598554779082,0.009295020632529552,2018-04-13,08:35:00,Friday,4,8,31,8,26,40,254,1,61,0,1,6,10,3,0,4.0,7.0,"['iia', 'al', '', 'a', '', '/ A']","['iia', 'al', 'a', '/', 'A']",True,"['iia', 'al', 'a', '/', 'A']",5,5,8,1,1,1,2,6.332802263536338,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

#TeenTitansGOMovie #TeenTitansGOToTheMovies #TTGTTM #BeastBoy #Cyborg #Raven #Robin #Starfire

When the Teen Titans go to the big screen, they go big!  “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” finds our egocentric, wildly satirical Super Heroes in their first feature Movie extravaganza—a fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the super hero genre, complete with musical numbers.

It seems to the Teens that all the major super heroes out there are starring in their own movies—everyone but the Teen Titans, that is!  But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick.  If only they could get the hottest Hollywood Movie director to notice them.  With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.  But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously Super-Villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry.  The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line!

Will Arnett (“The LEGO® Batman Movie”) and Kristen Bell (“Frozen”) lend their voices to the first-ever big-screen version of DC Entertainment and Cartoon Network’s animated TV show, which also stars Greg Cipes (TV’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”) as Beast Boy, Scott Menville (TV’s “Spider-Man”) as Robin, Khary Payton (“The Walking Dead”) as Cyborg, Tara Strong (the “My Little Pony” franchise) as Raven, and Hynden Walch (TV’s “Adventure Time with Finn & Jake”) as Starfire, reprising their roles from the series.

The Movie is being directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath, based on characters from DC.  Michail, Will Arnett and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers.  Apart from Arnett, all are “Teen Titans GO!” series contributors.

Set to release on July 27, (s18), “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

The Universe is a vast expanse encompassing all spacetime that, by definition, has no clear edge. The unique Infinite Galaxy Puzzle encapsulates this concept in a challenging 133 piece puzzle.

When completed, the artwork depicts a section of our own Milky Way galaxy in an approximately eight-inch square area. But, like space, this infinite puzzle has no defined edge and wraps in on itself. Take a piece from the left or upper edge of the puzzle, flip it, and you can reinsert it into the right or bottom edge. The double-sided printing gives an added challenge to puzzle masters.

This boundless continuum of a puzzle reveals the true non-orientable surface of the jigsaw and of our Universe. So get puzzlin' to infinity and beyond!

I'm an absolute amateur in CNC machining and yet I'm very proud that I managed to cut my first part in aluminium. It was really after I saw a tutorial on Pocket's NC youtube channel https://goo.gl/H6xjQC which helped me tremendously.
This video is not simultaneous 5-axis machining but 3+2 axis, because A and B axis where locked at any given time. This is due to using fusion 360 which if I'm not mistaken can support 5 axis machining at the moment, only some features are available for the moment. My ultimate goal is to make a tiny supercharger and put it in the wankel.

Any help on how can I use 5 axis cam in fusion 360 will be appreciated.

""LOS ANGELES — Southern California is fighting a renewed onslaught from the wildfires menacing greater Los Angeles, with emergency crews contending with brisk winds, steep terrain and fatigue from days of relentless work.

Schools are closed, roadways are shut and nearly 200,000 people have been told to evacuate their homes. Winds were strengthening on Thursday, with warnings that gusts could reach 80 miles per hour.
The four largest fires had scorched a combined 116,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties by Thursday morning, and none of those fires was close to being contained. “I’ve got to be honest, we’re concerned about everything,” said Armando Hogan, an assistant Los Angeles fire chief.

At least two other fires have been reported — one in Riverside County and one in San Diego County.

The unfavorable weather conditions have the region on edge, and brush fires broke out Thursday in Oxnard, Malibu, Huntington Beach and in the San Diego area, prompting a quick deployment of emergency crews.”*
