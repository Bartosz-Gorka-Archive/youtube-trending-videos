Kim Kardashian‚Äôs former assistant just threw some serious shade and there‚Äôs so much drama it could be its own Keeping Up with the Kardashians episode.

It looks like the Kardashian clan isn‚Äôt as close as they used to be. 

Even if you‚Äôre NOT a fan of the Kardashian‚Äôs, you know who Stephanie Shep is. She rose through the ranks of Kris Jenner‚Äôs company and became Kim Kardashian‚Äôs personal assistant. From booking flights to pushing away creepy paparazzi, Stephanie has been an integral part of the Kardashian Empire.

Stephanie was not only an assistant, but she was actually best friends with the KarJenners. She was out at a club with Kourtney Kardashian when Kim‚Äôs Paris robbery happened and she often posted pics with the whole fam proving that her job was more than just a job.

During this season of Keeping Up, we‚Äôve seen Steph take more charge and ask Kim for more responsibility. When Kourtney brought up the fact that Steph didn‚Äôt feel fulfilled, Kim got mad that Stephanie wasn‚Äôt coming to her with these concerns. 

This kind of confrontation was unusual between the pair and we were shocked when we found out that Kim fired Steph as her assistant. An insider source told PEOPLE QUOTE ‚ÄúShe was a good assistant but when Stephanie wanted to transition into a larger role with Kim‚Äôs brand and businesses, it just didn‚Äôt work. Kim gave her the chance but after a short period of time it became clear that Stephanie just didn‚Äôt have the knowledge to take on a role like that. Kim made an executive decision to part ways.‚Äù

It‚Äôs been rumored that the two are still friends, but after Steph‚Äôs recent Instagram story fans aren‚Äôt so sure. In her story, Stephanie wrote about how self care isn‚Äôt always about expensive face masks and bath bombs, but sometimes it means QUOTE ‚Äúletting go of a bad friend‚Äù or QUOTE ‚Äúforgiving yourself for not meeting your impossible standards.‚Äù

Fans couldn‚Äôt help but notice the similarities between her recent firing and post, especially when it comes to friendship and standards. 

Could this have been serious shade or just sound advice? Let us know what you think in the comments below! I‚Äôm Drew Dorsey, thanks for tuning in!

And then click to the left to see why The Weeknd deleted every picture of Selena on his Instagram. Thanks again to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring today‚Äôs episode. Xfinity Mobile is a new kind of network designed to save you money.

Controversially, Olivier (Mutable CEO) has decided to discontinue some of the most successful ones‚Ä¶ yet the most admirable thing he does is to open source the code for his modules, so they have the potential to live on and evolve forever.

The big question I had is, how do they compare to the real thing? If the differences are small or even unnoticeable, VCVRack can become very disruptive. 

I picked three of his most beautifully sounding modules (in my view of course‚Ä¶) Elements, Rings and Clouds (which is has been discontinued!) ‚Äì and I compare the sound of the hardware to that of the software. These modules are digital, so they have a good chance of sounding similar, but DAC and other hardware magic or software tweaks might make a difference.

Andre Black Nerd Review of Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, and Nick Jonas. A sequel/reboot to the 1995 Jumanji movie starring Robin Williams, this time with the board game being a video game and taking four teenagers into the video game world of Jumanji. How does Jumanji 2017 compare to Jumanji 1995? Could it have stood on its own as a new franchise rather than relying on Jumanji nostalgia? And how funny is Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle? Very!

Note: this movie, is kindof PG-13ish. This is only because it has mild violence, it really is around a PG rating but it does contain some violence and blood.

Warning: at (55:16-55:24 ) into this movie. There is a scene where there are rapidly blinking or strobing lights.

Synopsis: Barry Allen, the Flash, is known as the fastest man alive, but is he really? Flash struggles with new villains and obstacles that arise within his life and he begins to question if he really is the fastest man alive. However, fastest man alive or not, Barry Allen is ready to take on any immense and dangerous force threatening his city, Central City.

The concept art book for the film reveals what was conceptualized to an even greater degree (which I wish we got). However today's episode will cover just what Luke was supposed to experience in The Last Jedi upon his deep meditation. It's a scene that was never put into the film, however with 20 minutes of deleted scenes being added to the movie upon home release, I hope we get it in a deleted scene, which would be really interesting to see.
Who could this dark side ghost be? Snoke? Palpatine? Darth Vader? Anakin Skywalker?

Prometo ya disponible en: https://WarnerMusicSpain.lnk.to/Prometo2018


Cansados de mirar siempre el reloj
la huida no nos vale para hoy
si a√∫n nos cuesta hacer el equipaje
todav√≠a nuestro amor no se mud√≥.

Te observo y sigo amando lo que veo
es cierto, no hago m√°s que dar rodeos
lo nuestro ha sido un viaje de ida y vuelta,
hagamos el amor en el vag√≥n, que nos detengan.

Curo tus labios rotos,
besarlos costaba poco
qui√©n nos dijo que no somos buen equipo
no supo bien de quienes hablaba ese tipo.

Dejamos de jugar bajo la mesa
perdimos la costumbre y las maneras
vagamos por la casa los domingos
en vez de hacernos juntos un ovillo.

Me sigo preguntando lo que sientes
me marcho justo antes de que lo cuentes
ahora somos todo lo que odiamos
pero dejemos de pensar por un segundo en qu√© fallamos.

Te debo otra canci√≥n y alg√∫n te quiero
te debo un viaje por el universo
te debo un beso por cada aeropuerto
y m√°s veranos llenos de buenos recuerdos.

Te debo no deberte nada a cambio
nosotros ni obligamos, ni juramos
dejamos las palabras y actuamos
el mundo tiembla cuando sin querer nos amamos.

Initially, the hope was to restore power to 95% of the population by mid-December. Now, Army Corps say power won't be back until May.

Hurricane Mar√≠a destroyed 80% of the island‚Äôs electric grid. But the unprecedented blackout isn‚Äôt just due to the storm‚Äîhuman beings played a role here too.

VICE News traveled to Puerto Rico to figure out why it's taking so much longer than expected. We spoke to the new head of PREPA, the island's public utility company, embedded with the Army Corps of Engineers, and spent time with Puerto Ricans, who are starting to lose faith in the recovery.

CoinDaddy and teamHODL joined forces together to form the foundation of the Cryptonati. Hide your coins, hide your wives, hide your kids. We're hacking everyone in ""Tales From The Blockchain""  Lyrics in description

[Chorus]
ICO keep your holdings on my blockchain,
Crypto sphere making motions in the blockchain
Pump and Dump make the holding prices inflate
Get my money up the whale to you fish steak

[Verse]
I been building up my long bitch 
Straight crypto multi millie rich 
And I'm fucking with my main clique
Tether federal reserve bitch 
Straight fucking with the ICOs
I'm in Davos doing crypto blow
GDP ain't a thing to me
Cryptonati one world currency 
You think you safe
Think again
Your money's gone
One click away,
Pump and dump pump and dump
Get your hopes up fuck you raw 
Bought supply then dumped it all
Coindaddy don't give no fucks 

[Chorus]
ICO keep your holdings on my blockchain,
Crypto sphere making motions in the blockchain
Pump and Dump make the holding prices inflate
Get my money up the whale to you fish steak

[Verse]
I pump and dump then I short,
a whale and the ball's in my court,
I play this game like a sport,
Sick gains then off to resorts,
Found a bug now I'm up in your wallet and taking your funds,
then on the run,
got 99 problems but crypto ain't one,
taking your bits and feel bad for you son,
pirating for private keys,
store Monero offline over seas,
flow with CoinDaddy over beats,
making moves like Novo-G,
love it when you call me big shill,
rocking chinchill off that red pill,
looking at crypto like it's real,
while fiat blows in the wind like a pinwheel

[Chorus]
ICO keep your holdings on my blockchain,
Crypto sphere making motions in the blockchain
Pump and Dump make the holding prices inflate
Get my money up the whale to you fish steak

We visited during the Christmas season so we got to see all of the holiday decorations and the Christmas tree in the main lobby. We checked out the Mercantile gift shop for souvenirs and visited Whispering Canyon Cafe, Territory Lounge, Artist Pointe, and Roaring Forks within the main lobby building of the hotel. After that we ventured out onto the resort grounds to see the pools and recreation facilities. While doing so we stopped for lunch at Geyser Point bar and grill for some lunch. After lunch we ventured over to the Disney Vacation Club area of the resort to do some more exploring. We found the Carolwood room which showcases some of Walt Disney's personal collection of railroad cars. Finally we ended up at the very end of the property where we found a group of deer enjoying a mid afternoon snack. Join us tomorrow for another new video!

Isn't that interesting? No, it's not, I agree, but something doesn't have to be interesting for me to mention it in a description.

It goes without saying that he didn't score in the 20-point range again tonight. It says it right there in the video title: ""17 points"". That's how many points he scored, I am not purposefully deflating his point totals to earn some sort of twisted sympathy for him. Count up the buckets if you don't believe me, and if you still don't, go rewatch the whole game and see how many points he scored.

I am in favor of more people watching more full games. Sometimes I feel like the whole world consumes nothing but highlights. Sometimes I feel that way about my own viewing habits, except I can't even rewatch one of my own vids without getting super bored.

The tools I started out with at the beginning of the cabin build are not the ones I'm finishing with and in this video I explain why. From my axe and saw to my hammer and nails, the tools change and evolve throughout the DIY project, but I also discover which tools are a waste of money and which ones I can't do without.
Building a log cabin alone in the wilderness is difficult enough with help and power equipment, but I have been surprised at how well it can go with a little forethought and a lot of thinking and adjusting on the go. I thought I would need more equipment for handling and lifting logs, but I was able to do it with muscle power alone, saving time and money in the process. 
If you haven't seen the rest of the my videos on the cabin build where I put these tools to use, check out the Playlist titled, Log Cabin: Bear Den. From the first tree cut down with a Gransfors Brux axe and Agawa Canyon Boreal21 bow saw to the final board on the roof, and this week, a front porch, all of the process has been documented in that playlist.

Genome Wide Association Study for self-reported mosquito attractiveness:

The twin study showing correlated attractiveness is stronger for identical twins:
http://ve42.co/MossieTwins

Some things we know make mosquitoes more attracted to you:
Exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid, ammonia, acetone.

There are a number of folk remedies people believe protect them from mosquito bites like drinking alcohol, eating garlic, or taking vitamin B. These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.

And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic. This may be mediated through your immune system, which is what a lot of the genes identified were associated with.

It's not a secret that some actors are ready to do anything to get into the role. Some of them even agree to perform some crazy stunts! However, if a stuntman replaces the star in some scenes, this doesn't mean that the actor or the actress is lazy. We know many of them would happily jump on trampolines and fly, but imagine what would happen if the protagonist of the movie gets a serious injury on the set? This will break all the deadlines, the film company will have huge losses, and we will be able to see the long-awaited film much later. That's why doubles come to the aid of actors.

From spine-tinglers to mind-benders, here are some films you should definitely check out at least once in your life. Some small spoilers ahead...

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39y1BFi_iA4/sddefault.jpg,0.008228975817907614,0.00028243031652264785,29.13630490956073,0.00037839824061238484,0.008511406134430263,0.008889804375042647,2018-05-10,08:35:00,Thursday,3,8,37,8,32,40,327,4,76,0,1,7,16,3,0,4.0,8.0,"['Waaaney |\\.', '‚Äò HOTEL \\']","['Waaaney', '|\\.', '‚Äò', 'HOTEL', '\\']",True,"['waaaney', '|\\', '.', '‚Äò', 'hotel', '\\']",6,6,17,2,0,0,0,6.226026791250032,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'cup': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Jermaine Sneed -  I know things in the DCEU are up in the air. However normally WB/DC has not loved characters in tv and film. And Arrow almost seems to be dropping a back door pilot for a Death Stroke show. With possible DCEU movies with the character. Is a tv show really likely?

Charlie Zicari - Tune in every day. Wanna get your perspective on Lasseter‚Äôs situation at Pixar‚Ä¶ Chances he‚Äôll return and chances another leader will be brought in‚Ä¶ perhaps with Bob Iger‚Äôs successor?

Gabriel Soto - Hi John. Every studio is making their own streaming services, like Disney or DC. I think this is a problem. This will be so expensive, not everyone would effort it. This could increase the piracy. But i don't know... what do you think about that?

Anthony Seco - Why is everyone saying DC is done because of Justice League? ""They have to reboot"" ""They have to start fresh"" etc... Well just because a movie doesn't do great doesn't mean you have to reboot. What about franchises like Mission Impossible, 007, etc. They just continue. Why is this any different?

Dhruv - Hey John, a lot of people are angry that WB 'cut' Zack Snyder‚Äôs vision and demand that they get a director‚Äôs cut because they believe Joss or WB ruined the movie (they even have a petition!) My question is do you think WB will do this?

Police adopt new tactics to tackle moped thieves after rise in violent crime
Officers have been given new, faster motorbikes and will continue chasing suspects even if they take their helmets off.
Police will continue to pursue escaping moped thieves, even if they take off their helmets, Britain's top police officer has warned.

Scotland Yard Commissioner Cressida Dick said: ""We haven't reduced pursuits. There are a lot of myths around this. People think if they take off their helmets we will stop, but that's not true.

""We have more than doubled the number of pursuits and that will continue, particularly with the introduction of new bikes.""

Ms Dick was speaking as the Metropolitan Police revealed new tactics against moped thieves which they said had already cut the level of a crime that has rocketed in the past two years.

In this video, we travel on board the delivery flight (ferry flight) of Singapore Airlines‚Äô brand new Airbus A380 aeroplane, travelling from Toulouse to Singapore, and thoroughly examine the features of each of the four classes offered on board ‚Äì first class, business, premium economy and economy.

The particular model which Singapore Airlines takes delivery of, and which we have the honour of travelling on, is the Airbus A380-800. We were specially invited by Singapore Airlines to travel on this flight and we also get the honour during the video of speaking with and enjoying the company of Anthony from Airbus‚Äô social media team.

It was great to be in the audience for the magnificent and dramatic delivery ceremony of Singapore Airlines‚Äô new A380 and we‚Äôd like to thank them sincerely for their invitation.

On board, we travel business class, contained within the top deck of the Airbus A380 along with the first class cabins, and examine the unique sleeping arrangement afforded by the unique structure of each seat and speak to fellow passengers about what they think of this ‚Äì let us know in the comments; would you be happy to sleep diagonally?

Economy class actually brings rather more benefits to passengers that you might expect. We examine the directional head rests provided in economy class, which provide expert head support when sleeping to ensure that you get a comfortable rest on board. These head rests are able to move freely in any direction and also have built in neck support. The 11 inch entertainment and information screens built in to the back of each seat in economy class offer greatly increased usability and convenience with all controls now operated through the touch screen rather than the seat‚Äôs arm rests. With a reading light, foot rest and even power sockets, the economy class on board Singapore Airlines‚Äô new A380-800 won‚Äôt leave you wanting and we enjoy trying out all of these useful features during the flight.

Premium economy is also no disappointment, with couples able to move their arm-rests to be closer to one another, sophisticated, multiple setting foot rests and plenty of leg room and also the ability to even recline slightly.

First class is truly a wonder to behold with both single and double suites available, sporting comfortable, full sized beds and wide, comfortable seats containing integrated controls within their arm-rests which let you even change the angle that the wide, wall mounted television make with the wall letting you get the best view. There‚Äôs plenty of storage space and hidden, fold out tables that let you take control of your routine and activities on board, providing you with the freedom to either work on your laptop or enjoy your dinner as if you were sitting in your dining room at home! We also examine the bathroom facilities of first class, which even come with Lalique toiletries!

Upon arriving in Singapore, we have the honour of being received by the arrival ceremony, attended by a number of Singapore school children.

Let us know down below in the comments what you thought of it all, especially the provisions of economy class, and we look forward to flying with you again soon!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3CrpWOY8bKE/sddefault.jpg,0.007559566984434006,0.000465749343741365,16.230977211278486,0.00045675457078382615,0.00802531632817537,0.008482070898959197,2017-12-15,08:07:24,Friday,4,6,63,6,35,39,508,0,46,1,3,6,45,0,4,6.0,7.0,['SINGAPORE NTU 3 |'],"['SINGAPORE', 'NTU', '3', '|']",True,"['singapor', 'ntu', '3', '|']",4,4,13,1,0,0,0,6.67168037598565,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

She said she was happy Beyonce grew her hair back, but some haters weren't so enthused.

via PopSugar:

When Beyonc√©'s longtime hairstylist Neal Farinah recently posted a¬†photo of the singer's curls¬†with the caption ""ALL NATURAL"" and hashtag #naturalcurlyhair, the internet freaked out. Some were in awe of her luscious, thick mane, while others couldn't believe that was Bey's real hair. The two opposing sides escalated into a full-on war in the comments section. Neal ended up posting an Instagram video likely in response to the (totally unwarranted!) speculation.

Underneath wigs and weaves, black women have some of the most beautiful, curly hair. It's a choice a woman makes. And that's the choice for a black woman to choose to wear a wig or weave ‚Äî if she wants to. Ain't nothing wrong with it,"" he said. ""So, the myth of a black woman not having hair? Y'all think again. Because they have some of the most beautiful, textured hair. Recognize.

After saying his piece, Neal further made his point when he posted more photos of his recent work on Beyonc√© with the caption ""BEAUTIFUL NATURAL CURLY HAIR."" Some close-up shots of Beyonc√© with long, straight hair had people up in arms once more after Neal wrote, ""SAY WHAT: REAL.""

While no black woman should ever have to offer ""proof"" that her hair is real or defend it in any way, if anyone ever questioned Beyonc√©'s blessed locks, they should look no further than her mom, Tina Knowles. Neal also reposted a video of himself and Tina that showed off similarly textured hair.

""People have been asking me how I get the natural, curly look,"" Tina said in the video. ""My hair is naturally curly. I washed it. I put it up. And Neal put a few curls in it to define it. I went on a boat and it got really frizzy last night, so it's being curled again. I just want to show you how he did it.""

Neal demonstrated touching up her curls using a skinny marcel iron. ""THIS IS HOW I SLAY THAT GOOD ALL NATURAL BEAUTIFUL CURLY HAIR: RECOGNIZE,"" he wrote, ""ANY QUESTIONS[?]""

Last night, Ms Tina got back on Instagram and bragged on how happy she was that Beyonce grew her hair back with a picture of Beyonce from the back showing off her long ponytail.

Some people were still hating and couldn't believe that Beyonce could grow her real hair so long in just 4 years.

While others commented that of course your hair will grow if you take care of it underneath the wigs and weaves.¬† What do you think? Do you believe this is Beyonce real hair? Or do you think she still has in some clip ins or some sort of weave?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3FRFHBXt58k/sddefault.jpg,0.006863768872644998,0.0008702084149153723,7.8875,0.0034518267124976428,0.00773397728756037,0.011185804000058013,2017-12-17,16:33:34,Sunday,6,13,27,13,19,75,211,5,33,0,0,11,0,3,1,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6179319538077,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Rag'n'Bone Man - Lay My Body Down (Lyrics)

All I'm looking for
Is a little bit more rope
To wrap around my throat

I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble

And all I'm gasping for
Is one last breath of hope
To heal the hearts I broke

I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble

When you lay my body down
When you throw me in the ground
Don't be sorry
When you lay my body down
When you throw me in the ground

Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Turn your heart
To the trail
Of souls behind me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me

All the fearful eyes
Stay burned upon my mind
The gift they left behind

All my troubles
All my troubles

Still they find the words
Ring louder than my thoughts
Lay heavy as a curse

I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble

When you lay my body down
When you throw me in the ground
Don't be sorry
When you lay my body down
When I'm buried in the ground

Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Turn your heart
To the trail
Of souls behind me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me

These are my confessions
I'm singing out my dying words
These are my confessions
Make peace before I hit the dirt
These are my confessions
Hear all my sins laid down in verse
These are my confessions
Oh, these are my confessions

Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Turn your heart
To the trail
Of souls behind me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3FvzJZL_dSo/sddefault.jpg,0.0076981498929249124,0.00024062673736569877,31.992080253431894,0.00012196497775663718,0.007938776630290611,0.00806074160804725,2017-11-17,08:00:00,Friday,4,8,68,8,28,40,481,5,79,0,0,6,0,2,10,4.0,6.0,"['=}', '', '_F*', '', 'OC nT']","['=}', '_F*', 'OC', 'nT']",True,"['=', '}', '_f*', 'OC', 'nT']",5,5,9,2,1,0,0,5.510247779252549,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. 
People who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that‚Äôs because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   
A daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. 
Muscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don‚Äôt break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn‚Äôt require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.
The Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.
A group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.
If you still don‚Äôt feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn‚Äôt mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.

SUMMARY
-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.
-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. 
-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.
-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. 
-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.
-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.
-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.
-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.
-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.
-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.
-Keep in mind the FIT formula. It stands for Frequency (how often), Intensity (how fast), and Time (for how long).

Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she finds herself on the island where her father disappeared.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Tomb Raider is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero.  The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina, The Danish Girl) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (The Wave), with Oscar-winner Graham King (The Departed) producing under his GK Films banner.  The film¬πs production begins on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

Tomb Raider also stars Dominic West (Money Monster, 300), Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight, Django Unchained) and Daniel Wu (AMC¬πs Into the Badlands).

‚ÄúSpecial prosecutor Robert Mueller zeroed in on President Donald Trump‚Äôs business dealings with Deutsche Bank AG as his investigation into alleged Russian meddling in U.S. elections widens.

Mueller issued a subpoena to Germany‚Äôs largest lender several weeks ago, forcing the bank to submit documents on its relationship with Trump and his family, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the action has not been announced.

President Donald Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer John Dowd disputed that account, saying he had been told by Deutsche Bank that no such subpoena had been issued.

‚ÄúWe have confirmed that the news reports that the Special Counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false.  No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources,‚Äù Dowd wrote in an email.‚Äù

She makes banger after banger after banger. It's a scientific fact.

That's why the 25-year-old has some pretty huge mega-fans who'd LOVE to meet her.

Roman Kemp and Selena decided to prank one of her biggest fans, by inviting her to the Capital studio and testing out a VR reality experience, that'll let you see your favourite stars - in this case, the 'Wolves' singer.

After she was briefed with what to do in the virtual world, she'd be greeted by a virtual Roman Kemp and a virtual Selena Gomez. The only thing is... They weren't virtual. While the fan had the headset on, she was actually seeing the real Selena.

In fact, she was actually TOUCHING the real Selena, after she asked for a high-five and a cuddle. Yeah, we're jealous too.

The only thing we're really upset about is that this VR Selena Gomez isn't an actual thing. If someone could work on that, that'd be great.

Why the oceans experience two high tides and two low tides each day?

The oceans on the earth's surface are attracted to the moon through the effects of gravity. Because the strength of the gravitational attractions depend on the separation distance of objects, the oceans on both sides of the earth, as well as the earth itself, experience different gravitational forces towards the moon, causing two oceanic bulges which result in two high tides daily.

The video also explains why tides as well as moon rise and moon set are 50 minutes later each day, based on the moon's orbit around the earth.

About Atomic School:
Atomic School supports the teaching of Atomic Theory to primary school & science students .
We provide lesson plans, hands-on classroom resources, demonstration equipment, quizzes and a Teacher's Manual to primary school teachers. Animated videos that clearly explain the scientific ideas supports learning by both teachers and students. As a teacher, you don't have to look anywhere else to implement this program.

Our work has been verified by science education researchers at the University of Southern Queensland, Dr Jenny Donovan and Dr Carole Haeusler, who confirm that primary students are capable of learning much more complex scientific concepts than previously thought, and crucially, that they love it. Students run to class!

The program has been trialed in Australian schools as well as schools in the Philippines, Iran and India. It is conducted as holiday workshops at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Queensland Museum as well as the World Science Festival.
It has attracted wide media interest, including TV, radio and print, and the research data has been presented at prestigious American Education Research Association and Australian Science Education Research Association conferences. 

Atomic Theory underlies all the other sciences- genetics, electronics, nanotechnology, engineering and astronomy- so an early understanding will set them up for a more successful learning sequence for all their science subjects, and support their mastery of mathematics as well. We also have extension programs that cover Biology, Physics and Astronomy to an equal depth.



About Ian Stuart (Email: ian.douglas.stuart@gmail.com):
The founder of Atomic School, Ian Stuart, taught Chemistry and Physics for 25 years at senior levels before he realized that his 8-year old son, Tom, could understand Atomic Theory at a much deeper level than he expected. After visiting Tom's class at school, he discovered that his peers could also grasp the abstract scientific concepts, as well as apply it usefully to the real world.

Ian then developed a program to teach the advanced concepts of high school Chemistry, Physics and Biology to students 10 years younger than they normally would. He found that this engaged their interest in modern science early, and sustained it through to high school and beyond. It also sets them up for future success in their academic and career paths.

Ian has a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry from the University of Queensland and a Master's degree in Electrochemistry from the University of Melbourne.

üëâ Lyrics üéº:
Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies
Careful what you wish for
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
Saying that we wanted more
I feel like I'm falling, but I'm trying to fly
Where does all the good go?
We're looking for answers in the highest of highs
But will we ever, ever know?
And I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle
But if love is enough, could you let it show?
If you feel it could you let me know?
(Oh, oh) if you feel it could you let me know?
(Oh, oh) I'm not asking for a miracle
Ask for forever when the end is in sight
Showing what you want to
We're looking for light inside an ocean of night
But will we ever see it through?
And I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle
But if love is enough, could you let it show?
If you feel it could you let me know?
(Oh, oh) if you feel it could you let me know?
(Oh, oh) I'm not asking for a miracle
Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies
I'm not asking for a miracle
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
I'm not asking for a miracle (I'm not asking for a miracle)
(I'm not asking for a miracle)
I'm not asking for a miracle
If you feel it could you let me know?
Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies
I'm not asking for a miracle
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
I'm not asking for a miracle (I'm not asking for a miracle)
Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies
I'm not asking for a miracle
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
I'm not asking for a miracle (I'm not asking for a miracle)

3TjeB9ZiUCw,uGwcNjWrgaU,People Are Eating Up the New FAT UNICORN CAKE Trend,Clevver News,24.0,2018-02-12 22:23:23+00:00,"['News', 'clevver news', 'entertainment', 'in other news', 'fat unicorn cake', 'candy queen bee baker']",67020.0,1312.0,72.0,117.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3TjeB9ZiUCw/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

Well, looks like I know what kind of cake I want for my birthday this year‚Ä¶

Yes, it‚Äôs pretty obviously the Internet is in a fun blown love affair with unicorns, but thanks to these new fat unicorn cakes, the obsession has been taken to a whole new level.

If you‚Äôve been trolling Instagram over the last few weeks ‚Äî which come on, you were probably trolling the Gram literally right before you started watching this video ‚Äî you might have noticed these little babies popping up on your discover feed.

And yes, I may or may not have attempted to lick my screen after seeing these photos. Plus, I‚Äôm HIGH KEY freaking out over how cute they are.

So you might be wondering just what makes a fat unicorn cake so special? Well as you can see, it‚Äôs basically a regular cake with a chunk taken out of it. 

PS, I‚Äôd gladly volunteer to eat the missing piece.

But then, you make your own little fat unicorn with what I‚Äôm assuming is a lot of fondant. Yeah, it might be better if that part is left to the professionals. Just look at the detail on those things! It honestly looks like that unicorn is about to come to life.

However, one inventive cake decorator took things up a notch by not just placing a fat unicorn by a cake, she literally crafted a cake with the mythical creature chowing down on some tacos.

@candyqueenbeebaker posted the photo with the caption: ‚ÄúUnicorn Brillante (cause he's half like me) Uni Is made of Cake, everything is All edible and handmade. This is what Love looks like. Who else loves mexican food. All of my favorites, Pan dulce, tacos, mexican soda‚Äù

Girl, you are speaking my language!

We have a feeling this is only the beginning of this tasty trend. I can‚Äôt WAIT to see what people bake up.

And I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and say it, I think someone should have this as a wedding cake. Literally GOALS.

What do YOU think of fat unicorn cakes? Are you on board for this sweet trend? Share your thoughts, feelings, comments, or concerns, below, and click HERE if you wanna see what‚Äôs going on over in Pyeongchang. Hopefully some of those athletes will be able to celebrate winning gold with a nice slice of unicorn cake.

Many thanks to all of you for joining me on this journey, I‚Äôm Joslyn Davis, and we‚Äôll see you next time!

Wolfine, Maluma Baby, Mua

Maluma:
Ayer me dijeron tus amigas,
que andabas busc√°ndome como loca en la calle,
y yo bebiendo como un loco cerveza;
con unos parceros da√±√°ndome la cabeza,

Wolfine:
Borracho con el coraz√≥n malo,
caminando solo, me la encontr√© a ella

Mujer tan bella yo con una botella,
me dej√© enredar f√°cil, ca√≠ en las garras de ella
Mujer tan bella yo con una botella,
me dej√© enredar f√°cil, ca√≠ en las garras de ella

Maluma:
Maluma Baby
Me cogiste en un momento de debilidad,
yo jur√°ndome que nunca m√°s te iba a tocar,
todo por culpa de esas malditas cervezas,
con esos labios en frente quien no te besa,
porque no fui capaz de ah√≠ mismo darle stop,
en el ranking de mi culo siempre fuiste el top,
nos cagamos los dos solos en la relaci√≥n,
lo dejamos a lo loco as√≠ sin protecci√≥n.

Era demasiado tarde y yo con los tragos en la cabeza,
eres mi debilidad me encanta cuando te pones necia.
Era demasiado tarde y yo con los tragos en la cabeza,
eres mi debilidad a ti nadie te endereza

Wolfine:
Mujer tan bella yo con una botella,
me dej√© enredar f√°cil, ca√≠ en las garras de ella

Maluma:
Mujer tan bella yo con una botella,
me dej√© enredar f√°cil, ca√≠ en las garras de ella

Maluma Baby

Wolfine:
Me dijeron que andabas un poco triste,
que te pusiste a beber y con un man por ah√≠ te fuiste,
Ay baby me da√±aste el coraz√≥n,
ya no creo en el amor,
ahora por ti soy peor
Ay baby me da√±aste el coraz√≥n
ya no creo en el amor
ahora por ti soy peor

Maluma:
Ayer me dijeron tus amigas,
que andabas busc√°ndome como loca en la calle,

Wolfine:
y yo bebiendo como  loco cerveza;
con unos parceros da√±√°ndome la cabeza

Maluma:
Mujer tan bella yo con una botella,
me dej√© enredar f√°cil, ca√≠ en las garras de ella

Coro:
Mujer tan bella yo con una botella,
me dej√© enredar f√°cil, ca√≠ en las garras de ella

It has significance with the compass that was found on Pillio in Palpatine's hidden observatory, what could this mean? Is it from Darth Vader's lightsaber crystal? Does it belong to an Ancient Sith? Jedi? Force user?

What could Luke Skywalker want with such a dark, ancient crystal?

Watch the video that will pop up at the end regarding How Darth Vader Turned His Lightsaber Crystal Blood Red, it will help explain some things.

Have a great day and may the force be with you...ALWAYS!!!

Fifth Harmony sends fans an EMOTIONAL goodbye in their final music video, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Me You Love Me‚Äù

Harmonizers -- it‚Äôs time to get the tissues, ice cream, and waterproof mascara ready.

After six years of incredible songs and videos, Fifth Harmony just released their FINAL music video as a group -- at least for now, hopefully. The video features all four girls dressed up in beautiful formal gowns in an empty studio warehouse, as they each take turns belting their hearts out to the devastatingly poignant lyrics to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Me You Love Me‚Äù. Lauren kicks things off looking like an actual ANGEL as she sings her part.

Normani‚Äôs solo is next, followed by Ally and Dinah.

Finally, the 5H women come together to belt out the chorus towards the end of the song -- and it‚Äôs clear that each of the four ladies is truly giving it their all for this last video.

And in case that wasn‚Äôt enough to get the waterworks going, they end the the music video with each member individually walking out the door. It‚Äôs a clear yet pretty heartbreaking metaphor for each of ladies leaving 5H to focus on their solo careers.


Why is saying goodbye so hard?! Probably because it feels like Fifth Harmony still has SO much more potential and incredible music to create and share as a group. That being said, we‚Äôre so excited to see what the ladies come out with as individual artists, so leaving on such a bittersweet note with this music video definitely feels fitting.

Okay Harmonizers, what‚Äôs your reaction to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say You Love Me‚Äù being 5H‚Äôs last music video? Are you completely heartbroken and left wanting more, or do you think this was the perfect note for the group to end on? Sound off with all your thoughts in the comments below, and after that click right over here to watch Selena Gomez troll her Met Gala look again! Thanks so much for joining me on News Feed, I‚Äôm your girl Drew Dorsey and I‚Äôll see you next time!

UNDER DENVER // LYRICS

Just wait and see
Just sit and breathe
Your life's unimportant
Your ego's distorted
Just let what is, be
Delusions of control, how's the wool feel
Pre-decision doesn't mean that this is not real
Why throw away what you've been given to spite it
What will be, will be
Children of the world, dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you, sleep and you'll know the truth
Children of the world, dream in peace
Here, rebuild in solitude
Under Denver calling you
You're not alone
Your truth is wrong
It's best to accept it
No sense in resisting
Just let what is, be
Listen, follow orders, buy, consume, sell
Stay on the surface, it's okay to trust the system
Tried and tested, they know best, they know the outcome
What will be, will be
Children of the world, dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you, sleep and you'll know the truth
Children of the world, dream in peace
Here, rebuild in solitude
Under Denver calling you
They're more than we
They hold the keys
They live in the silence
Just offer compliance
And what will be, will be
Children of the world, dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you, sleep and you'll know the truth
Children of the world, dream in peace
Here, rebuild in solitude
Under Denver calling you

The Incredible Edible Ten Breakdown
I'm gonna be honest, I rarely cook specific ""dishes,"" I find it to be a bit of a waste of ingredients, and it often gets boring. I'd much rather spend that same amount of time prepping a few simple ingredients so that I can have almost endless variation. Ever since I figured this out, it has been a total game changer in the kitchen.

Keep in mind that you can use these categories for nearly any cuisine, I am sharing a few things that I like to get in each category, but you can keep it as simple or complex as you want.

1. Fresh: Lettuce, Cucumber, Carrots, Broccoli
2. Protein: Chicken, Tofu, Eggs, Beans
3. Spice: Chili, Hot Sauce, Sriracha, Cayenne
4. Main Batch: Curry, Chili, Soup
5. Crispy/Crunchy: Peanuts, Fried Shallots, Other Nuts
6. Starch: Rice, Rice Noodles, Other Noodles, Potatoes
7. Umami: Garlic Soy, Umami Powder, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Thai Dressing
8. Herb: Cilantro, Scallions, Mint
9. Citrus: Lime
10. Pickled: Pickled Daikon and Carrots, Chili Vinegar

There is a bonus 11th that I realized should be included depending on the cuisine, that is sweet. In my case I had sweet in some of the other elements, like the umami dressing, so I didn't include it as its own category, but ideally, you'd want sweet if you like it in your savory foods.

[Verse 1]
Murder lives forever and so does war
It‚Äôs survival of the fittest, rich against the poor
At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a human trait
Hidden deep down inside of our DNA

[Verse 2]
One man can build a bomb, another, run a race
To save somebody‚Äôs life and have it blow up in his face
I‚Äôm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I‚Äôm not afraid of God, I am afraid of man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is it running in our blood, is it running in our veins?
Is it running in our genes, is it in our DNA?
Humans aren‚Äôt gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

[Chorus]
Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We‚Äôre just animals still learning how to crawl

[Verse 3]
We live, we die, we steal, we kill, we lie
Just like animals, but with far less grace
We laugh, we cry, like babies in the night
Forever running wild in the human race

[Verse 4]
Another day, another tale of rape
Another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
I‚Äôm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I‚Äôm not afraid of God, I am afraid of man

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You can see it on the news
You can watch it on TV
You can read it on your phone
You can say it‚Äôs troubling
Humans aren‚Äôt gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

[Chorus]
Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We‚Äôre just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We‚Äôre just animals still learning to behave

[Bridge]
All the hate coming out from a generation
Who got everything and nothing, guided by temptation
Were we born to abuse, shoot a gun and run
Or has something deep inside of us come undone?
Is it a human trait or is it learned behaviour?
Are you killing for yourself or killing for your saviour?

[Chorus]
Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We‚Äôre just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We‚Äôre just animals still learning to behave

ABOUT THE HANDMAID'S TALE
Adapted from the classic novel by Margaret Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale is the story of life in the dystopia of Gilead, a totalitarian society in what was formerly the United States. Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‚Äòreturn to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander‚Äôs household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids ‚Äì where anyone could be a spy for Gilead ‚Äì all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her.

Dead And Gone Lyrics

One year ago, with a flower in hand
One year ago, we wrote our names in the sand
The wind would blow your summer hair
Once easy love, now you‚Äôre making it rough
You know I try, you say it‚Äôs never enough
You left with ease and didn‚Äôt care

What used to seem like heaven, feels like hell

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it‚Äôs gone wrong
I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you‚Äôre dead and gone
When you‚Äôre dead and gone

Ten years from now, we‚Äôll be tired and old
Ten years from now, we won‚Äôt ever leave home
Singing ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there for you‚Äù
(Ten years from now)
Gave me the one and only reason that could make me believe
You we‚Äôre everything I want, but not the thing that I need
It‚Äôs hard to say, it‚Äôs sad but true

What used to seem like heaven, feels like hell

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it‚Äôs gone wrong
I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you‚Äôre dead and gone
When you‚Äôre dead and gone

Nothing left here to say
Nothing to celebrate

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it‚Äôs gone wrong
I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you‚Äôre dead and gone
You only get redemption when you‚Äôre dead and gone
When you‚Äôre dead and gone",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3bRUM_FJAFY/sddefault.jpg,0.010630437493044277,0.0002962196845511393,35.88700564971752,0.0007171194058201313,0.010926657177595415,0.011643776583415548,2018-04-19,15:43:39,Thursday,3,8,44,8,31,49,306,2,49,0,1,8,39,1,3,5.0,6.0,['re'],['re'],True,['re'],1,1,2,0,0,0,1,6.719274683650182,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'car': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Ethan Cannistra - Hi John love the show and watch everyday. If Fox sells off their film division to a studio other than Disney will the rights to fantastic for and X-Men revert back to marvel. I know that fox cannot sell the rights to their marvel characters to another studio.

Scott Ellis - With Coco winning the box office again, I saw on Rotten that there are no big marketable movies coming out until Star Wars. That made me think of Netflix's ""Bright"". With a reported $90 million budget and Will Smith as the star, could it have done well in theaters in early December before Star Wars came out? Also, how will Netflix judge if the film is a success for its own platform?

Samuel Polay - In looking at the upcoming films that are also trying to gain awards consideration, and just how crowded this year had been for good movies, I find myself worried that ‚ÄúLogan‚Äù may get shafted by the Academy. All three leads deserve acting nods, especially Stewart, but this film truly deserves a best picture nomination, if not a win, and I fear it may not even get close. 

Zachary Shaw - Hey John question? Paul Rudd recently came out and said that Ant-Man and The Wasp will be a romantic comedy superhero film, What do u think of this; do u think this a correct direction Marvel should go with this film. Also is there a chance that this film won't be as well received since Edgar Wright isn't involved in an capacity?

Jenna Seung - Hi John. Love your shows! My question is about The Last Jedi and Battlefront 2. I‚Äôm a big Star Wars fan and gaming fan. I got Battlefront 2 and have been totally turned off by their pay to win philosophy, locked characters and seemingly disdain for the consumer. It‚Äôs left me feeling less excited for The Last Jedi to be honest. Could this be a big problem for the movie when it comes out?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3cW0kHcUOho/hqdefault.jpg,0.03671313779494023,0.0015900508248388654,23.089285714285715,0.008603310712967433,0.0383031886197791,0.04690649933274653,2017-12-04,18:59:03,Monday,0,20,20,19,20,96,143,3,34,0,0,18,19,5,1,4.0,6.0,"['S', 'oe', 'nA', '=', 'wi', 'Qu', '=', '=', 'oo', '=', '=', 'oS ¬´', 'uu', '=']","['S', 'oe', 'nA', '=', 'wi', 'Qu', '=', '=', 'oo', '=', '=', 'oS', '¬´', 'uu', '=']",True,"['S', 'oe', 'nA', '=', 'wi', 'Qu', '=', '=', 'oo', '=', '=', 'oS', '¬´', 'uu', '=']",15,10,22,6,1,2,1,6.118206413444188,3,"['happy', 'neutral', 'scared']",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

Being a family medicine physician I can very much empathize with the situation. The dedication and contribution to healthcare from both fields is incredibly understated.

Studying to become a nurse is a noble undertaking and it is a career with so many positives that I decided to make a dedicated video to all the amazing nurses out there. Instead of just me talking about nurses I decided to vlog with some of my staff I've been working with for the last few years to give you some first-hand insights into the career. Obviously, some of the nurses are a bit camera shy, which is understandable but I think they did a great job highlighting whats its like to be a nurse and in general about being a nurse. 

I know you guys have wanted a hospital vlog for some time now but as you can imagine vlogging in a hospital can be quite difficult with patient privacy and all. But for nurses week 2018 I had to make an exception and interview my colleagues. Also at the end of the video, you'll see many of the doctors I've worked or am still working with. 

So, on this kickoff for Nurses Awareness/Appreciation week I again from the bottom of my heart want to say:

THANK YOU!

- Doctor Mike Varshavski D.O.

P.S. If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series next week so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3cljaQ_RoAg/sddefault.jpg,0.012447767106113308,0.00010482525490858172,118.74778761061948,0.0003752373062877991,0.012552592361021887,0.012927829667309687,2017-12-14,09:35:00,Thursday,3,9,38,9,33,54,334,0,79,0,1,8,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,"['ers', 'Ta)']","['ers', 'Ta)']",True,"['er', 'Ta', ')']",3,3,5,1,0,1,0,6.554973106285657,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Kylie Jenner, 20, and Tyga, 28, may be exes, but if there‚Äôs one thing they can agree on, it‚Äôs that the safety of their kids and family members comes first! That‚Äôs why when Kylie saw the footage of Blac Chyna, 29, going ballistic at Six Flags on April 1, the reality star reportedly reached out to Tyga right away. Not only was her niece, Dream Kardashian, 1, with Chyna at the park that day, but so was Tyga and Chyna‚Äôs shared son, King Cairo, 5. Being a parent herself, Kylie apparently expressed to T that she‚Äôs worried about Chyna being around the kids in that state. And honestly, we totally understand where her concerns are coming from!

Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in The Post, a thrilling drama about the unlikely partnership between The Washington Post‚Äôs Katharine Graham (Streep), the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), as they race to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spanned three decades and four U.S. Presidents.

This video couldn't have been made without the talent and support of my Patrons.  I'm blown away that we had well over 500+ people unite to perform my favorite song from the greatest show man!!  This is me is one of the most important songs of the last few years.  It has one of the best messages that we all need to take to heart and teach to our younger generation.

Bayli Baker was my collaborator in all of this.  She's a freaking AMAZING human being, and you would be silly not to follow her and see her light shine... one HECK of a choreographer too.  Any dancers out there? Ya get in touch with her: https://www.instagram.com/Bkrbaay/

[Verse 1: Lettie Lutz]
I am not a stranger to the dark
""Hide away,"" they say
""'Cause we don't want your broken parts""
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
""Run away,"" they say
""No one'll love you as you are""

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus:]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun
(We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble, Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

[Bridge: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know that I deserve your love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's nothing I'm not worthy of
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
Look out 'cause here I come
(Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
(Marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Outro: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Lyrics:
We used to stay in all night
When it cold outside
We used to make a bed on the floor
And talk about nothing till the morning
I can‚Äôt believe that we‚Äôre standing here
Girl, I need you to know
That we‚Äôve really got this now
Haven‚Äôt we
I could be anywhere
As long as you‚Äôre there
Smoking my cigarettes and hating my hair
I can‚Äôt believe that we‚Äôre standing here
Girl, I need you to know
That we‚Äôve really got this now
Haven‚Äôt we
Can we stay like this
Do I even have to ask
I know we will
I know we will
Girl, I need you to know
That we‚Äôve really got this now
Haven‚Äôt we

In Indonesia, a mysterious cult with the impressive name Swissindo World Trust International Orbit has attracted a global following for its promise to magically make one's debts go away.  

The group is led by Soegihartonotonegoro, a charismatic leader who calls himself M1, and presents himself as a godlike figure who can erase the world‚Äôs debt due to a seemingly limitless ancient inheritance.  To find out the truth behind this bizarre story, VICE Indonesia correspondent Arzia traveled to visit the Swissindo Headquarters in Cirebon, Indonesia, and interviewed M1, and his followers.  

We also met with the manager of a local bank that had been targeted by Swissindo for its debt services, and a client of Swissindo's whose experience with the group was not exactly as anticipated.

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films‚Äô content before it‚Äôs lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

Through a series of miscommunications, remixes, and bad deals, the original ‚ÄúKernkraft 400‚Äù morphed into something DJ/Producer Florian Senfter couldn‚Äôt stand. But the bastardization made him famous, sending him on tours around the world, and giving his song an audience of millions who would recognize the melody anywhere.

VICE met up with Senfter to hear the story of how a fluke remix to his song wound up reaching the top of the charts‚Äîwhether he liked it or not.

Isabelle Gall de son vrai nom na√Æt en octobre 1947 dans une famille de m√©lomanes. Son premier contrat avec une maison de disques, elle le signe d√®s l‚Äô√¢ge de 16 ans. La jeune chanteuse suscite un engouement national d√®s ses premiers titres. Serge Gainsbourg, avec qui elle partage son directeur artistique, lui √©crit Poup√©e de Cire, Poup√©e de Son', avec laquelle elle gagne l‚ÄôEurovision. De Claude Fran√ßois √† Julien Clerc, France Gall partage la vie des plus grands artistes de la sc√®ne fran√ßaise, qui lui d√©dient plusieurs titres. En 1976, elle se marie au compositeur Michel Berger, avec qui elle aura Pauline puis Raphael. Avec lui elle partage ses titres, mais aussi la sc√®ne, dont la plus fameuse reste ""Starmania"". Malheureusement, la maladie de leur fille ain√©e, Pauline, viendra ternir leur bonheur. Michel meurt √† l‚Äô√¢ge de 44 ans d‚Äôune crise cardiaque. Peu de temps apr√®s, Pauline s'√©teint √† l'√¢ge de 19 ans alors que France se remet tout juste d‚Äôun cancer. Elle partage alors sa vie jusqu'au bout avec son fils Raphael entre New York, Paris et le S√©n√©gal.

3iMlOH6hdOw,EZSCtgfmEO0,Real Reason NASA Hasn't Sent Humans To Mars,Tech Insider,28.0,2018-03-01 22:00:01+00:00,"['Tech Insider', 'TI', 'Tech', 'Science', 'Innovation', 'Digital culture', 'Design', 'Technology', 'NASA', 'International space station', 'Barack Obama', 'George W. Bush', 'Donald Trump', 'US government', 'government', 'Apollo', 'moon', 'mars', 'Space Shuttle program', 'Peter Diamandis', 'exploration', 'space exploration', 'Constellation Program', 'Journey to Mars']",1888057.0,24151.0,1110.0,5224.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3iMlOH6hdOw/default.jpg,"We could have been on Mars 30 years ago.¬†At the peak of the Apollo era in the early '70s, NASA was already planning its next step into the unknown.

Its plans included building multiple space stations, continued trips to the Moon, and the first crewed mission to Mars by the 1980s.¬†Can you imagine watching astronauts walk on Mars the same time the walkmen came out?

But NASA never sent humans to Mars in the '80s.¬†And here we are 30 years later, still dreaming of the possibility.¬†But the reason isn't necessarily a matter of technology or innovation. It actually comes down to politics.

As a government agency, NASA's goals are determined by the Executive Branch.¬†Since its inception, NASA has served under 12 presidents.¬†And it was clear near the start that not every president would support NASA equally.

By the end of Nixon's administration in 1974, NASA's budget had plummeted from 4% of the federal budget to less than 1%.¬†Fully-funded Apollo missions 18 and 19 were abandoned along with Apollo 20.

At the same time, Nixon pulled NASA's focus away from the Moon and Mars and instead toward low-Earth orbit.¬†His parting gift was to sign into effect what would eventually become NASA's Space Shuttle program.

Peter Diamandis:¬†""So what's happened throughout all of space history after the Apollo program was over was to start, stop, start, stop, cancel. President comes in like Bush comes in to go to the Moon, back to Mars and next president comes in and cancels that. The agency is unable to sustain consistent funding to do anything.""

It wasn't until the Space Shuttle Program was nearing retirement that a crewed mission to Mars was finally considered and funded by a US president.

George W. Bush, in 2004, announced:

""We will give NASA new focus and vision for future exploration. We will build new ships to carry man forward into the universe to gain a new foothold on the Moon.""

As a result, NASA's Constellation Program was born. Never heard of it? That's because it was canceled a few years later.¬†It aimed to send a crewed mission to the Moon in 2020 and land the first humans on Mars by the 2030s.

By the time Obama was sworn in, the Constellation Program was behind schedule and over budget.¬†One year later, Obama canceled 100% of the program's funding.

""All that has to change. And with the strategy, I'm outlining today it will."" -Barack Obama in 2010.

Obama shifted NASA's focus from sending people to the Moon and Mars to, ultimately, just Mars.¬†In the process, he asked Congress to increase NASA's budget by $6 billion over the next 5 years.

As a result, NASA launched its ""Journey to Mars"" initiative in 2010, with the goal to send humans into orbit around Mars by the early 2030s.¬†And, until recently, NASA was on track, more or less. Then, this happened.

‚ÄúPresident Trump has launched the National Space Council and at the council‚Äôs inaugural meeting in October, we unanimously approved a recommendation to instruct NASA to return American astronauts to the moon and from there to lay a foundation for a mission to Mars.‚Äù -Mike Pence in 2017

Oddly enough, the space policy under Trump and Obama look nearly identical, save for 63 words.¬†In those 63 words, Trump's administration has shifted the focus once again to a Moon-first, Mars-later initiative.¬†

NASA isn't new to this. It's learned to recycle old projects to fit new missions.¬†For instance, the Orion capsule was first developed for Constellation and has since been redesigned for the Journey to Mars.

But even that can't prevent the inevitable changes NASA programs now face under the new president.

""We're also going to realign the organizational structure to best meet this new exploration focus. I've asked Stephen¬†Jurczyk the current head of space exploration to lead and effort to design a new organizational approach."" -Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr. in 2018

As NASA pushes on, a new possibility has grown on the horizon. Privately-owned space companies like SpaceX also has its sights set on the red planet.

Diamandis:¬†""The scientists and engineers at NASA are amazing and they've done extraordinary things. But they're risk aversion...That doesn't allow us to do new and novel things that are on the edge. Doing anything big and bold in space is hard and it's risky. So, it's entrepreneurs taking the risks these days, willing to put everything on the line.""

The race for Mars is on.¬†While NASA has closely partnered with SpaceX and other privately-owned space companies in recent years, ultimately, NASA may not be the ones who write the next chapter in human space exploration.

Peter Rabbit, the mischievous and adventurous hero who has captivated generations of readers, now takes on the starring role of his own irreverent, contemporary comedy with attitude. In the film, Peter's feud with Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) escalates to greater heights than ever before as they rival for the affections of the warm-hearted animal lover who lives next door (Rose Byrne).  James Corden voices the character of Peter with playful spirit and wild charm, with Margot Robbie, Elizabeth Debicki, and Daisy Ridley performing the voice roles of the triplets, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail.

Now the more cynical out there will say money. After all, four billion dollars is a lot of money. That wasn‚Äôt the case though. He didn‚Äôt shop it around to different studios or try to find the highest bidder. When he decided to sell the company he had built over the course of 41 years, he chose Disney. There was a history between Lucas and Disney that played a pivotal role in the sale, and it dates back to as far as Lucas‚Äô childhood.
 
On a lengthy family trip, his parents Dorothy and George Sr took the family down to Anaheim in July of 1955 for the grand opening of Disneyland. Lucas was eleven years old at the time. His path as a filmmaker was still far off, but he immediately took to the immersive lands and rides the theme park offered. As he later described it, he was ‚Äúin heaven.‚Äù The family would continue to make regular trips to Disneyland over the years as George grew up, planting the seed that would grow over the following decades.
 
In 1984 Disney was in the middle of warding off a hostile takeover. Part of that attempt included installing new leadership into the company. While not the only one to make the suggestion, Lucas would reach out to Disney‚Äôs majority shareholders, the Bass Brothers, and personally recommend Michael Eisner for the position. Eisner would of course accept the position and he would, along with Frank Wells stepping in as president, serve as the new face and direction of the Walt Disney Company. 
 
One of the first things Eisner would do as CEO is, as it turns out, reach out to George Lucas. Lucas, a lifelong Disney fan, jumped at the opportunity. He would have the chance to help create attractions for the very theme park he delighted in visiting all those years ago at the age of eleven.
 
A few years later Lucas would once against make a connection that would end up playing an important role down the line. In the early 1990‚Äôs he began working on a television show based on the adventures of a young Indiana Jones. He would eventually pitch the series to the chairman of ABC at the time, Bob Iger. Iger green-lit the show and it ran for two seasons. When later looking back on the series, Iger said ‚ÄúI wanted it to work very badly. It was George Lucas, come on.‚Äù The show would ultimately fail, but Lucas took note of how supportive Iger was of the whole idea.
 
Star Tours at the Disney Parks was about to reopen with new 3D effects and a new randomized system that took guests to locations from, again for better or for worse, the prequels. Lucas himself was checking in on the ride‚Äôs progress every couple of weeks over the years the ride update was being designed. By that point Bob Iger had replaced Michael Eisner and was Disney‚Äôs CEO.
 
The morning the ride was to reopen in May of 2011, Lucas and Iger would sit down to breakfast at the Brown Derby. Without beating around the bush, Iger asked Lucas if he‚Äôd ever consider selling Star Wars to The Walt Disney Company. Lucas had just turned 67 years old, and he was already beginning to think about a retirement plan that involved passing the reins of Star Wars on.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready to pursue that now,‚Äù he told Iger. ‚ÄúBut when I am, I‚Äôd love to talk.‚Äù 
 
It would take another year before Lucas would fully entertain the thought, but when he finally decided he was going to step down from running LucasFilm, he got in touch with Iger and kicked off a five month negotiation process. As it would turn out, Pixar would serve as a major influence for the decision.
 
You see, one of Iger‚Äôs first major decisions as CEO of Disney was to acquire Pixar in 2006, and what impressed Lucas the most wasn‚Äôt what Iger did with the company, but what he didn‚Äôt do. For the most part, Pixar was left to continue doing what it did best without too much interruption or change. 
 
So without seeking out the highest bidder, Lucas agreed to sell his company to Disney for a total of a little over four billion dollars, with half of that being Disney stock. It wasn‚Äôt a quick heartless cash grab from one executive to another. It was a creator who had spent over 40 years building an empire out of his passion passing on his creation to an organization that he had looked up to as a kid and worked with and respected as an adult. So on October 30th of 2012 he would fly to Burbank to meet with Iger and sign the deal. From that moment the next chapter of the Star Wars saga would begin.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3lEkSAnfxD4/sddefault.jpg,0.02157555205522057,0.0009531166915814713,22.636842105263167,0.005703650938569121,0.022528668746802042,0.02823231968537116,2017-12-11,16:03:35,Monday,0,9,86,9,29,46,514,1,52,0,0,8,0,3,12,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.376233870166942,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Description:
In the past two decades, the NFL has shifted to more pass-happy offenses. Long gone are the days when every team needed an elite running back to carry the load. You can succeed without a great rusher, but you need a good quarterback to win in today‚Äôs NFL.

However, some NFL teams have valued the running back position more than others. Throughout their history, they‚Äôve always had that go-to star in the backfield.

I‚Äôm Justin Fraction, and today we dive into 10 NFL teams that always have awesome running backs. And a huge shoutout and thank you to Super Juice for suggesting this video!

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

The process only takes a few minutes to complete and is pretty straightforward!

This same procedure will apply to any X7xx Series garden tractor and many older tractor models as well.  While not identical, the same general concept applies to the 1 Series and 2 Series family of John Deere tractors.  You'll notice that I've added a pair of 9"" plow extensions to my blade which brings the total width to 72""!  These are made by Superior Tech and sold through your local John Deere dealer.

Raised to stardom by the veteran car based film-comedy Genevieve (1953), he appeared in many roles as a carefree, happy-go-lucky gent. His biggest hits from this period include Raising a Riot (1955), Reach for the Sky (1956), and The Admirable Crichton (1957). He starred in Doctor in the House (1954), the first of the popular Doctor film series. Although his career declined in the early 1960s, two of his own favourite films date from this time - The Comedy Man (1964) and The Greengage Summer (1961) with Susannah York, ""one of the happiest films on which I have ever worked."" He also enjoyed a revival in the much-acclaimed TV adaptation of The Forsyte Saga (1967) and the Father Brown series (1974).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3oQPBb7d6L4/sddefault.jpg,0.006010819475055099,0.00033393441528083883,18.0,0.0009922622625487783,0.0063447538903359385,0.007337016152884715,2017-12-05,08:15:56,Tuesday,1,5,2,5,2,34,16,3,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.002752882480736,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3owpHUbyvzc/sddefault.jpg,0.00777248803228683,0.0002423464569669513,32.07180385288966,0.00042654674124656064,0.00801483448925378,0.008441381230500342,2018-05-03,08:35:01,Thursday,3,8,37,8,32,50,329,0,76,0,1,7,16,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['ROOSFYELT', '', 'Ne ealetaay', '', 'Sa', '=e', '', 'fe . a f', '', 'j']","['ROOSFYELT', 'Ne', 'ealetaay', 'Sa', '=e', 'fe', '.', 'a', 'f', 'j']",True,"['roosfyelt', 'Ne', 'ealetaay', 'Sa', '=e', 'fe', '.', 'a', 'f', 'j']",10,10,29,1,0,2,1,6.194464951480888,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

After finishing evening's last performance, bandmates hugged and raised their arms in unison. 

Richie Sambora and Alec Jon Such reunite with their former Bon Jovi bandmates for the Rock Hall induction ceremony.  Alec John Such left the group in the mid-Nineties and hasn't appeared with them onstage since 2001. Lead guitarist and key songwriter Richie Sambora departed Bon Jovi in 2013. The Rock Hall inducted  founding members Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, bassist Alex John Such and drummer Tico Torres, alongside Such's replacement, Hugh McDonald, who stepped in in 1994.

Bon Jovi reunited on the Rock Hall stage for a rousing rendition of their chart topping rock classic. Livin' on a Prayer is from their third album Slippery When Wet. Written by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Desmond Child, the 1986 single gave Bon Jovi their first number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and their second consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit. The song is the band's signature song, topping fan-voted lists and re-charting around the world decades after its release.

I'm sorry I have NOTHING for Jennifer at this point. I tried. I don't think she even wanted to be married. Why play this sham for so long. I can't really find anything particularly wrong with Otunga, as Jennifer seemed to be the one hesitant to marry. She chose to play herself but you don't have to. How can you avoid being stuck in the 10-year faux engagement?

TOP 6 Futuristic Wallets You MUST Have ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/EfdRkQmY3yg
Top 10 COLLEST ATVs in the world ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/0H4majC5x8M

WingLights
While turning on the road, the cyclist is supposed to indicate it by hand movement in the corresponding direction. In general, this procedure is very convenient and clear for the drivers, but it does not work well in the twilight and, especially, at night, because the cyclist is basically not visible.

Trail Racer
. A small company Lauf from Reykjavik, Iceland, has developed a revolutionary front fork of Trail Racer for mountain bikes.  The fork combines the soft stroke of the shock absorbers and the low weight of the rigid forks. The plug is made of carbon fiber and weighs only 2.2 pounds. The amplitude of the stroke in the 60 mm fork is provided by 12 cushioning plates made of a flexible but very strong composite.

SoftWheel
SoftWheel is a newly invented wheel. The new wheel aims to develop a wheel with an integrated suspension. The idea helps to save up to 30 percent of the energy spent by a person when riding a bicycle precisely thanks to the suspension. The project used a symmetrical technology with a selective system, in which the cylinders minimize the force when the wheel hits. It is a wheel consisting of three ""spokes"" connecting the hub with a spring rim.

Bisecu
Bisecu is smart bicycle anti-theft bluetooth lock. The gadget was developed by the engineers of the startup of the same name in Korea. Locks that communicate with the user's smartphone via Bluetooth don‚Äôt make innovation but the creators of Bisecu still managed to improve this invention. Unlike most similar devices, this one is put on the wheel only once and does not require removing.

GObyLIVI
A gadget is a set of two devices working in tandem. The main purpose of this device is to simplify the controls of a bicycle or a motorcycle, while increasing traffic safety.  The gadget includes a compact display that is attached to the steering wheel, and a helmet with a built-in bluetooth headset.

Effigear Gearbo—Ö
Effigear Gearbo—Ö is a bicycle with a gear box. These bikes use a toothed belt instead of a chain, and a special gearbox is used for changing the speeds. Accordingly, there is no ""system"" and there is no cassette. Of course, there is no ""tail"" sticking down out of the rear wheel area, which is necessary for switching and for pulling the chain.

Trump was so angered that he took to Twitter to lash out at the author and his former chief strategist Steve Bannon who was interviewed for the book. He even gave him an excellent new nickname 'Sloppy Steve.' Oh and Trump hasn't forgotten about building that wall either.

Was hat sich im letzten Jahr im Bereich IT-Sicherheit getan? Welche neuen Entwicklungen haben sich ergeben? Welche neuen Buzzwords und Trends waren zu sehen?

Wie immer wagen wir den IT-Security-Alptraum-Ausblick auf das Jahr 2018 und dar√ºber hinaus. Denn was wir wirklich wissen wollen, ist ja schlie√ülich: Was kriecht, krabbelt und fliegt in Zukunft auf uns zu und in unseren digitalen Implants herum?

Im Zuge von noch mehr Transparenz, Kritik & Selbstkritik und kontinuierlicher nachhaltiger Optimierung aller Prozesse werden wir au√üerdem fr√ºhere Voraussagen hinsichtlich des Eintreffens unserer Weissagungen pr√ºfen.

Android is a feature rich and mature platform but there are still several features that Android lacks, especially features from the iPhones and iOS, and other custom Android skins.

1. Screenshot Tools
2. Native Screen Recording
3. Gestures

[INFINITE]

On January 8, 2018 at 6 pm, the group of six, INFINITE, provides a prelude to a new start. The title track ‚ÄòTell Me‚Äô is a song with the same but completely different feelings from the previous songs. It added the dreamlike and sophisticated feelings with the minimal sound and understated vocal based on the group‚Äôs signature sensibility. The more relaxed and mature performances are also remarkable.

Bar√ßa remain unbeaten in the league after 20 matches played, including a 2-0 win over this weekend's opposition at Mendizorroza.

The training session saw Ernesto Valverde give instructions to all of the available first team players, as well as Bar√ßa B's Jokin Ezkieta, Tar√≠n, O. Busquets and Cucurella. The starters from Thursday night's Catalan derby were given a recovery routine by the coaching staff.

A ella le gusta cuando bajo downtown

En su cuerpo puedo ver la definici√≥n
Se ve que lo trabajo eres motivaci√≥n
Le ped√≠ que me ayude con una misi√≥n
Que me llene entera de satisfacci√≥n

A m√≠ me gusta cuando baja downtown
Le pido que se quede envenciao‚Äô
Me dice: Baby, estoy interesao‚Äô
Si quieres ven y qu√©date otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo downtown
Me pide que me quede envenciao‚Äô
Le digo: Uh mami, estoy interesao‚Äô
Si quieres yo me quedo pa‚Äô otro round

Que me quede otro round
Tanto que me ha rodeao‚Äô
Ya lo tengo asfixiao‚Äô
Yo te he observao‚Äô

No aguanta, se adapta
Me dice: No quiero que termines (no)
√âs un misterio pero no decide (no decide)
En las noches soy yo la que define
Todo a lo que v√° pasar
A mi no me tienes que mandar

A m√≠ me gusta cuando baja downtown
Le pido que se quede envenciao‚Äô
Me dice: Baby, estoy interesao‚Äô
Si quieres ven y qu√©date otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo downtown
Me pide que me quede envenciao‚Äô
Le digo: Uh mami, estoy interesao‚Äô
Si quieres yo me quedo pa‚Äô otro round

Ooh, s√© que me quieres ver
Bajando por toda tu piel
Ooh, s√© que quieres que me quede
Enredarte en mis piernas es lo que quieres

No se vale el empate, esto es hasta darle jaque mate
Hasta que uno de los dos se mate
Si quieres yo bajo y de una me pongo pal' trabajo
Suelta el estr√©s, baby, yo te relajo
Se pone bella, me dice que ya
Sigue ah√≠, que la tengo viendo las estrellas
Si me acelera, hasta abajo se va
Y como ella lo hace, no lo hace cualquiera

En su cuerpo puedo ver la definici√≥n
Se ve que lo trabajo eres motivaci√≥n
Le ped√≠ que me ayude con una misi√≥n
Que me llene entera de satisfacci√≥n

A m√≠ me gusta cuando baja downtown

Fans are cheering with anticipation for the coming of Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúDescendants 3.‚Äù And with the new teaser that just came out, we have one burning question. Who is Mal‚Äôs dad? It seems that most of the villain kids come from single parent homes. Is this because their parents are too evil to keep the love alive? Maybe there are some secret love affairs going on that will be revealed in the next movie!

We all know Mal‚Äôs mom is Maleficent and is as wicked as they come. But according to the book, ‚ÄúThe Isle of the Lost,‚Äù Maleficent had a moment of weakness with what she called, ‚Äúa feeble human.‚Äù We are dying to find out who this weak mortal was! Since we have to wait until 2019 for the film to come out, we came up with some theories of our own. Here are 5 ‚ÄúDescendants 3‚Äù Theories About Mal‚Äôs Father.

ROME REPORTS, www.romereports.com, is an independent international TV News Agency based in Rome covering the activity of the Pope, the life of the Vatican and current social, cultural and religious debates. Reporting on the Catholic Church requires proximity to the source, in-depth knowledge of the Institution, and a high standard of creativity and technical excellence.

As few broadcasters have a permanent correspondent in Rome, ROME REPORTS is geared to inform the public and meet the needs of television broadcasting companies around the world through daily news packages, weekly newsprograms and documentaries.

He realised his usual lines wouldn't work. So we had a more honest conversation about what he does. Check out my India Quick-Start Safety Guide at https://indiasurvivalguide.com/.

I thought he was going to scam me by returning the ice cream for a refund. That was the plan I think. But I hung around and he eventually started eating it.

To Commenters: What a lot of people in the comments are failing to understand that is he realised he couldn't scam me so he was trying to scam the shop he was working for my taking me there as a fake customer.

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours: http://www.zoubatours.com/ for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn‚Äôt eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there‚Äôs a version that‚Äôs comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion.

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I‚Äôve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ¬Ω chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours (http://www.zoubatours.com/) for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch the full series here: https://goo.gl/QhiJUb

Understanding how blockchain works and identifying myths about its powers are the first steps to developing blockchain technologies.

Blockchain is an algorithm and distributed data structure for managing electronic cash without a central administrator among people who know nothing about one another. Originally designed for the crypto-currency Bitcoin, the blockchain architecture was driven by a radical rejection of at (government-guaranteed) money and bank-controlled payments.

Blockchain is a special instance of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), almost all of which have emerged in Bitcoin's wake.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?

Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that was invented to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was motivated by an extreme rejection of government-guaranteed money and bank-controlled payments. The developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned people spending money without friction, intermediaries, regulation or the need to know or trust other parties.

Technically, the original blockchain is separable from Bitcoin, but this report will show that the blockchain design is so specific to Bitcoin that it's not a good fit for much else.

The central problem in electronic cash is Double Spend. Because pure electronic money is just data, nothing stops a currency holder from trying to spend it twice. Blockchain solves the Double Spend problem without a digital reserve fund or similar form of umpire.

Blockchain monitors and verifies Bitcoin transactions by calling upon a decentralized network of volunteer-run nodes to, in effect, vote on the order in which transactions occur. The network's algorithm ensures that each transaction is unique.

It‚Äôs about remorse for our wrongs and the mental (or physical) letter we write to the person we‚Äôve wronged but also to ourselves to remind us of what it is we need to be for that person.

One of them happens to be the ‚ÄúBlack Suit‚Äù fans were hoping to see him wear in the movie. But as fans of Supes know, the black suit never made it in to the movie ‚Äì even after Cavill teased it in a previous Instagram post.

Collider‚Äôs own Perri Nemiroff and Mark Reilly break down and react to the new look, and speculate on why the suit never made it into the final cut. And with this particular scene, the two try and guess whether it was a scene directed by Zack Snyder ‚Äì or if it was included and shot by Joss Whedon. Let us know what you think about this possibility and what you think about Perri and Reilly‚Äôs thoughts on why it wasn‚Äôt included and drop in some comments of your own below.

As technology and theory advanced a need for larger and larger telescopes grew. Where the first telescopes were light enough to pick up and move, modern scopes take up entire specialized buildings and our largest is planned to be 40 meters wide.

But we're starting to hit the limit of how large we can make our telescopes as the cost to make these behemoths increases exponentially with size. A 1 meter telescope costs up to 250,000 whereas the monster 40m one will cost almost a billion. 

In this video we explore a design for what would be the largest telescope humanity will ever use. It would allow us to take images of an exoplanet from over 100 light years away at better resolution than hubble is able to see mars from earth. The proposed FOCAL spacecraft uses a weird property of space called gravitational lensing to bend light around the sun as if it was a giant lens.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Black Panther has made a huge impact on the MCU and audiences and it‚Äôs only just hit the big screen. A critical and commercial success, it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll be seeing more of T‚ÄôChalla and Wakanda after Thanos‚Äô war comes to an end in the final two Avengers films, which will see Black Panther return. Before that lands though, we analyzed the current film for easter eggs, references and other little moments we think you likely missed when watching the film. For example, what did the children of Wakanda mean when they called Bucky the ‚ÄúWhite Wolf‚Äù? There‚Äôs a pretty interesting meaning for it! Killmonger is one of the best MCU villains to date and he has a lot of history and motivation. There‚Äôs a lot of connective tissue between him and his Panther costume though and even more with the mask he stole in London early on in the film. There‚Äôs also a cool little fun fact concerning T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs father, T‚ÄôChaka and the actors who played him. There‚Äôs also a connection to the Oscar winning film Moonlight and how it ties back to Panther director Ryan Coogler. His reasoning for opening the film in Oakland is also important for real world history buffs-and comic book fans! There‚Äôs also a subtle reference to Doctor Strange towards the end of the film and a little nod towards the beloved film Back to the Future II courtesy of T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs sister, Shuri. One character had his name changed to be less, well...racist, compared to his original comic book roots and some arcs and images from the movie were pulled straight from the comic book page.

Lovelyz came back with its fourth mini album on a fresh spring day. ‚ÄòHealing‚Äô is the keyword of Lovelyz this time, who came back after improvement on a more sentimental and mature sensibility.
The title track ‚ÄòThat day‚Äô has the lively and cheerful energy of Lovelyz that was also shown in ‚ÄòAh-Choo‚Äô, ‚ÄòFor You‚Äô and ‚ÄòNow, we‚Äô.

Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. All Bitcoin transactions are documented on a virtual ledger called the blockchain, which is accessible for everyone to see. 

Bitcoin gives you complete control over your money, unlike other assets you own which are regulated by banks and governments. As bitcoin gains more popularity, more and more places accept it as a payment method.

3:43 - Fiat money drawbacks
4:25 - Digital money
5:34 - Centralized money issues

7:44 - Bitcoin is transparent
9:13 - Bitcoin is decentralized

A nightmare of undead bricks
It‚Äôs the Lego Zombie Apocalypse
Where monsters hunt you everywhere
There‚Äôs no hiding
Only fighting 

With ammunition running low
You face a nasty way to go
When undead blood runs through your veins

You‚Äôre craving Brains!

I am a Zombie
I‚Äôm out of control
Feasting on flesh
Has taken a toll

Eating the living
Oh what a life!
Come a bit closer
Let me take a bite

I am a Zombie

Ugly demons without souls
Fill em up with bullet holes
No such thing as overkill
Find a gun
Or freakin run!

Keep your allies nice and close
Unless one‚Äôs pale as a ghost 
Even if they were a friend

Shoot them in the head!

I am a Zombie
I‚Äôm out of control
Feasting on flesh
Has taken a toll

Eating the living
Oh what a life!
Come a bit closer
Let me take a bite

I am a Zombie
I‚Äôm hungry for brains
I‚Äôm violent and vicious
I feel no pain

Survive if you have to
And run if you must
But sooner or later
You‚Äôll be one of us

I am a Zombie

Well now I‚Äôm a little pissed
Screw this doomed apocalypse
Although I feel a little strange
A little cold...
But in CONTROL

It seems my human friends are gone
This Armageddon‚Äôs getting long

I thought we‚Äôd beat the zombie threat

I‚Äôm not dead yet",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/43v-BLu6d1M/sddefault.jpg,0.008142148847386779,0.0005003555157611988,16.272727272727273,0.0010725323974211342,0.00864250436314798,0.009715036760569113,2018-04-25,22:48:12,Wednesday,2,4,13,4,13,24,120,0,22,1,0,3,0,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.159227023135128,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{},0

Everyone knows everyone in Huntsville. So when tattooed, sweet-talking Josie (Sophie Turner) struts into town, heads turn. Striking up relationships with young punk Gator and loner Hank (Dylan McDermott), she quickly becomes a hot topic of local gossip. But her true intentions for showing up in this small, southern community are far more sinister as her dark past comes to light.

The video quickly grew in popularity, so WNDU visited the two kids and their mother on Tuesday.""Some people's kids are jealous of the next sibling down, and neither one of mine have ever been that way.They're always like, 'That's my sister, that's my brother.'They were never really jealous of the baby.They were more protective,"" explains Crystal, the kids' mother.While Jash is two years away from being allowed to start wrestling, Crystal says he'll be well-prepared when that day comes.""He doesn't play with toys, he plays with wrestling gear.He wears helmets and shin guards and mouth guards and singlets.so he's already ready,"" she said.Crystal's husband, Joel, introduced the whole family to wrestling, which he used to compete in when he was younger.Crystal says she's sometimes nervous watching her kids on the mat because of the injury risk, but she's glad that they practice sportsmanship, and always shake the hands of their opponents after a match.""We've been blessed with, we have four great kids.People always comment when we go out, 'oh, your children are so well-behaved.'They're not always like that at home, but we were really lucky,"" she says as Ruby declares snack time and begins raiding a cupboard for cookies to share with her little brother (and guardian).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/46JRXMfob8k/sddefault.jpg,0.004289623548554101,0.0015531395606833815,2.761904761904762,0.0003697951334960432,0.005842763109237483,0.006212558242733526,2017-12-14,17:23:21,Thursday,3,7,15,7,15,49,148,2,46,0,0,1,0,1,0,6.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.691333438397553,3,"['happy', 'neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,2,"{'book': 2, 'couch': 1, 'person': 4}",7

I show you with an experiment the true answer to this question. The argument against water being wet is that water makes things wet, but it is not wet. Fire burns, it is not burned. However, instead of arguing semantics, I show you some actual data (with semantics). I think if you follow me through the whole explanation you will agree with me too.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

MY VLOG SERIES - A SNEAK PEAK INTO HOLLYWOOD AND BEHIND THE SCENES:
I also have a VLOG series where I take you behind the scenes from when I meet with Hollywood stars at different interview locations and give you a little sneak peak of what it's like to interview some of Hollywoods biggest stars. In my VLOGS I also take you to premieres, Hollywood parties, premiere after-parties, red carpets, The Oscars, The Golden Globes - and travels to film festivals, like Toronto, Cannes and Venice, comic-con in San Diego, as well as the typical film junket. I share some of my favorite interview tricks, some amazing, funny moments, but also some of my bloopers and less proud or awkward moments. So please come along for the ride behind the scenes in Hollywood, and don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions or leave comments in the description section. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

While I was in Korea for the Olympics last month, I started to become obsessed with all of the good music I was hearing. I had heard a bit of K-Pop over the years, but after seeing Exo and CL at the Closing Ceremony, I couldn't help but look for more ICONIC bops. So I asked y'all on Twitter to give me your best suggestions and now I'm reacting to some of them here. Comment below what K-pop artists/songs I missed... and maybe I'll do another one of these videos soon! :)

Vultures are nature‚Äôs garbage collectors. They play an important ecological role in preventing the spread of disease and infection amongst African mammals. A sharp decline in some species of African vultures has lead to a crisis that could threaten the entire ecosystem. 

One of the main reasons for the decline is the illegal trade of poached vultures. Often, those body parts end up in the hands of sangomas, South African traditional healers. Some sangomas use vultures in a variety of ceremonies, one of which includes smoking powdered brains to communicate with their ancestors. 

In this episode of Symbiotic, Motherboard visited a muthi market in Johannesburg to see this ceremony firsthand and to hear from both sangomas and conservationists. This video originally aired on Motherboard.

The teaser trailer for ""Incredibles 2"" is here. Disney/Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" opens in theatres in 3D June 15th, 2018. Everyone‚Äôs favorite family of superheroes is back in ‚ÄúIncredibles 2‚Äù ‚Äì but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. It‚Äôs a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack‚Äôs emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again‚Äîwhich is easier said than done, even when they‚Äôre all Incredible. Directed by Brad Bird (‚ÄúIron Giant,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Incredibles‚Äù) and produced by John Walker (‚ÄúThe Incredibles‚Äù) and Nicole Grindle (‚ÄúSanjay‚Äôs Super Team‚Äù short, ‚ÄúToy Story 3‚Äù associate producer), ‚ÄúIncredibles 2‚Äù busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.
