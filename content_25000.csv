https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7kWmAAneUM

WINNING TRAITS OF A GOOD THERMOMETER
- Accurate within 1 degree of target temperature
- Reads in 3 seconds or less
- Comfortable to hold with multiple grips
- Easy to turn on and off
- Highly visible digital display
- Probe at least 4 inches long to reach into foods
- Automatic backlight display for low-light situations
- Sleep mode with motion-sensored auto-on so thermometer wakes up when you move it
- Rotating display
- Highly durable

WHAT WE TESTED

We tested 11 digital thermometers priced from $11.95 to $99.95. We ran a series of accuracy and speed tests and evaluated each model's comfort, ease of use, and durability while making caramel, roasted beef, seared steaks, and grilled chicken. We asked a series of testers to evaluate each thermometer's comfort and usability. Temperature ranges were reported by manufacturers; we calculated the average margin of error from all three accuracy tests. All thermometers were purchased online.

RATING CRITERIA

Accuracy: We evaluated the accuracy of each thermometer in an ice bath at 32 degrees, in a sous vide water bath set to 125 degrees (the temperature of a medium-rare steak), and in boiling water at 212 degrees; models that were within 1 degree of accuracy at each temperature rated highest; any thermometer within 2 degrees received a fair rating, and those that were more than 2 degrees off the target temperature received a poor rating.

Speed: We timed how long it took for each thermometer to read the temperature in ice water, boiling water, and a sous vide water bath at 125 degrees (medium-rare for a steak); those that read in 6 seconds or less rated highest.

Ease of Use: We rated how easy and comfortable each model was to use. We preferred those with spacious, grippy handles; long probes; and minimal buttons. Models with automatic wake-up, easy-to-read displays, and a single step for turning on and off also rated highest.

Durability: We monitored the thermometers throughout testing for both functional and cosmetic damage; those that emerged looking and operating like new rated highest.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.

ABOUT BEARDBRAND
Beardbrand is a men’s grooming company that is helping men keep on growing by providing education and tools for urban beardsmen to master their morning routine. We’ve found that confidence starts with self investment, and allows men to do great things for their families, co-workers, and community. We are working to break down the negative stereotypes that surround bearded men, and show the world it’s the man who matters, not the way he looks.

_____________________

earMUSIC is proud to announce the worldwide signing of Al Di Meola - the brilliant, virtuosic multi-instrumentalist, composer and arranger, who is considered to be one of the most innovative musicians and a living legend.

His brand new studio album “OPUS” will be released on February 23rd, 2018.

Al Di Meola is a pioneer of blending world music, rock and jazz. His ongoing fascination for complex rhythmic syncopation, combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony, has been the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has spanned over four decades.

The Grammy award winner achieved worldwide fame for both, being a solo artist and for his collaborations with Frank Zappa, Jimmy Page, Stevie Wonder, Chick Corea, Paco De Lucia, John McLaughlin, Jean-Luc Ponty, Stanley Clarke, Luciano Pavarotti, Paul Simon, Phil Collins, Santana, Steve Winwood, Herbie Hancock, and many more. Al Di Meola holds the highest amount of Guitar awards in different categories from Guitar Player magazine (US).

With a curriculum vitae rich of exciting musical moments and incredible works, Al Di Meola is still challenging himself pushing his music towards new boundaries but with a more relaxed way to see things. Over the last few years he has in fact literally started all over, reinventing himself in both, his private life and music.

“With OPUS I wanted to further my compositional skills as I think that the evolution of this part of my persona has labelled me more composer/guitarist than guitarist/composer” - says Di Meola – “at the same time this record also marks a new era in my life. For the first time in my life, I have written music being happy, I’m in a wonderful relationship with my wife, I have a baby girl and a beautiful family that inspires me every day. I believe it shows in the music.”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VycRdRjkusk/sddefault.jpg,0.012421961938173107,0.0005092514004413513,24.39259259259259,0.001003413870499255,0.01293121333861446,0.013934627209113714,2018-01-24,16:00:19,Wednesday,2,14,23,14,23,75,173,6,37,3,0,10,0,1,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.76065069605774,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

On February 2, 2018, Donkey Kong Forum removed three of Mitchell's highest scores from its high-scores list following analysis by Jeremy Young who stated that the scores were set using the MAME arcade emulator instead of arcade hardware.[30] Mitchell stated on the East Side Dave Show, ""I’ve never even played MAME. I don’t have MAME loaded in my home."" Mitchell continues by saying ""The film footage that he has, that Jeremy has, shows MAME play... I’m not disputing what he says. What I’m disputing is the fact that I want him to have the original tape.” Young's analysis has been criticized by Mitchell as being from an altered tape that otherwise matches Billy's gameplay pixel-for-pixel, to which Young responds that ""The amount of foresight, patience, and technical knowledge required would be staggering"" to make such tapes.

On April 12, 2018, Twin Galaxies announced that an investigation conducted into Mitchell's submitted scores found evidence that he did not use an unmodified version of the arcade game, and thus used either an emulator or some other disallowed means of achieving the scores. Twin Galaxies said that they had removed Mitchell's scores from their records and that he would be prohibited from submitting scores in the future.

To date, Mitchell has a single publicly witnessed high score of 933,900 from 2004.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VzzMiAe62hU/sddefault.jpg,0.014815456593311384,0.0013645815283313118,10.857142857142858,0.010006931207762951,0.016180038121642697,0.02618696932940565,2018-04-12,14:06:53,Thursday,3,10,61,10,30,66,501,1,58,0,0,8,0,1,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.811483156044513,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy and Pearl). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday and Sunday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

Although I'm going to be sharing the Christmas presents I got this year, I want you guys to remember that it's not just about the material things we get, Christmas is about giving and it truly brings me so much joy to give to my family and be able to put a smile on their faces. Merry Christmas everyone!! Hope you enjoy my christmas presents haul and that you all have an amazing day with your loved ones!🎄❤️

Today in this video I am sharing with you 100% effective home remedy to repair and shrink your drooping earlobes easily at home. Years of wearing heavy earrings and clip ons can leave our earlobes looking saggy and scarred. It’s a natural part of ageing but while wearing the heavy earrings could have be prevented, shrinking the lobes is harder than it seems. Sure, you could resort to drastic surgery, but there a few things you can try before you make that decision.

Camila Cabello’s debut solo album, Camila, is officially out everywhere, and it’s already receiving some pretty incredible accolades. The 20-year-old already beat out Selena Gomez as the female artist with the most streams on Spotify in one month and now she has another record under her belt. 

Shortly after midnight when it was released, Camila became the first debut album by a female artist to ever reach #1 on iTunes in 80 countries. 

But Camilzers didn’t stop there! As the hours progressed Camila went to to number one in more and more places, officially becoming the debut solo album with the most #1s on iTunes around the world of all time. Harry Styles previously held this record with his debut self-titled album. He peaked at 88 and Camila is currently at 96 and counting. 

Part of the reason why the former Fifth Harmony girl’s first solo album is doing so well is that she vowed to be as honest as possible in her songs, and she definitely delivered. 

She explained QUOTE “I feel like the best way to come up with something new and different is just to be the you-est you possible. If you pull from all the different little parts of yourself, nobody can replicate that.”

Camila worked very hard to make this album the best it can be, but she still doesn’t see what she does as work. She explained QUOTE “For me, I just love this. I love what I do and I often tell myself this thing I once saw on Oprah. It was don’t do something for the outcome, do it for the work and because you want to have something great in your portfolio, for you. I love proving that I can do things for myself, rather than for someone else.”

Camila recently admitted she felt QUOTE “hurt” by the shade 5H threw during their VMAs performance, but I highly doubt she’s looking back at everything that happened to her in the past year with anything but positivity. How proud of you of Cam are you right now? What do you think of the album? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below. I’m your hose Zoe Lillian thanks so much for watching clevver and I’ll see you next time.

Nobody saw Rachael Ray's world domination coming. The short, bubbly ball of energy has an empire of magazines, TV shows, and websites that perhaps only the mighty Oprah eclipses. Given Ray's humble beginnings and seemingly grounded disposition, it's easy to see why she's become popular. But don't imagine you know everything about her. Here are some things you may not have known about Rachael Ray…

Sixteen individual 13MP sensors ranging from 28mm to 150mm, laid out in a scattershot pattern without even the pretense of adhering to a grid, festooned with steerable mirrors that wiggled and warbled as they fixed those big mechanical eyes on a subject ... it was the perfect mix of oversized smartphone and terrifying Matrix robo-spider. I snapped one up as soon as it went on sale.

Unfortunately, I very quickly encountered many of the problems I'd read about – all of which trace themselves back to the core promise of the product. Light calls the L16 the ""camera of the future,"" and given its potent mixture of cutting-edge technology and the hefty $1950 price tag, I expected nothing less. Sadly, though, the photos the L16 delivered fell far short of the pictures kicked out by my Pixel 2 XL – disappointments which continued even after a software update and a trip through Light's special Lumen desktop suite. 

Of course the L16 wasn't made to go head-to-head with a smartphone; rather, it seems to have been built as equal parts technology showcase and DSLR replacement. And there's still a lot to learn (and some, even, to like) about the L16. It's just not a camera I would recommend to anyone at this point. Click on through to the MrMobile L16 review to find out why!

When thinking of stories to explore for this season of “Chosen Family”, a big queer experience I realized I didn’t know much about, was LGBTQ+ youth homelessness. I visited the Los Angeles LGBT Center in Hollywood for a tour of the Center & to meet with a group of young LGBTQ+ people who have experienced homelessness to hear their stories firsthand. I also got to meet Alexandra Grey, who before becoming a successful actress and singer, was homeless and got help from the Center.

Without a doubt, this huge shark is a true legend.

Dutch power duo Lucas & Steve teams up with Janieck for their new hit You Don't Have To Like It! Smooth guitar licks and tender chords are opening the song, followed by Janieck's touching and authentic voice, setting the tone for this unique tune. The tempo increases and once the drop kicks in, it's a true catch of the day with melodic synths and highly driven beats. No doubt that you will like this one!

Hot off the heels of Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel's Black Panther just came out on digital download. I thought the character has a lot of potential, but to me this movie had one core problem which prevented it from reaching the level of quality it possibly could have... a problem I like to call the Superman dilemma.

I'll try to make more videos over the summer for you guys. Definitely about upcoming releases like Deadpool and Solo: A Star Wars Story. You can also tell me any ideas you'd want me to cover.

The Long Island rapper was considered a rising star, cultivating an online following for his unique blend of emo-rock and hip-hop. His legacy continues to thrive through his music, including the recent posthumous release of his Marshmello collaboration “Spotlight.”

One of Peep’s biggest hits is “Benz Truck (Гелик),” a track off his 2017 debut album 'Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 1.' The song is produced by Smokeasac, who was Peep’s close friend and frequent collaborator. The producer spoke to Genius about the song’s creative process.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In 1977, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren come out of a self-imposed sabbatical to travel to Enfield, a borough in north London. There, they meet Peggy Hodgson, an overwhelmed single mother of four who tells the couple that something evil is in her home. Ed and Lorraine believe her story when the youngest daughter starts to show signs of demonic possession. As the Warrens try to help the besieged girl, they become the next targets of the malicious spirit.

Сейчас власть делает все, чтобы отвлечь внимание от своей вины в произошедшем. Посмотрите ток-шоу федеральных каналов - все разговоры только об ""определенных силах оппозиции, пытающихся раскачать лодку"". И не слова, например, о полностью провальной работе МЧС и пожарных. В государственной противопожарной службе работает 220 тысяч человек. Чем занимается эта огромная армия, сидящая на нашей шее?

Disclaimer
I can’t guarantee that all of the make-up and skincare products I recommend will suit you. I only use products I personally think are good having tried them on myself and my clients but everyone's skin is different and it's possible to be allergic to anything. Wherever possible, test products out on yourself before purchasing.

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

I do not accept payment and am not sponsored to make any of the films on this channel. Some of the links under the videos and blog posts on my site are affiliated however and as stated before, I only feature products I like, or want to try.

Zac Efron reveals that he had his favorite kiss ever with Zendaya!

I know. We all want to believe that his kiss with Vanessa Hudgens in High School Musical can’t be beat, but they were young.  He’s grown now and knows what he likes.

So Zac Efron and Zendaya are traveling all over the world together and talking about their chemistry with each other. No they aren’t dating! They are doing press for their new movie The Greatest Showman and in an interview during a press junket in London with FilmWebTV, they talked about a variety of things including their kiss in the film. The interviewer jokes about how Zac Efron kisses his co-star in all of his films and asks him if he puts it in his contract. Zac denies that, but when talking about his kiss with Zendaya’s character he says this.

Ok before we continue. Can you please zoom in on Zendaya’s face to see her reaction when he says that?

So I’m trying to figure out what her reaction means. It could either mean, yea he said that. I’m a great kisser. Or, maybe she was thinking did he just say it was his favorite kiss because it wasn’t mine.  Anyway, they also talked about chemistry and Zendaya said, ""Luckily, the point of having a chemistry read is to see if the chemistry exists and magically I think sometimes it just does. So we're magic people that came together and just have chemistry. I will say when you're immediately harnessed together and are running to each other in the air, that is a great ice breaker and bonds you quite quickly.""

Throughout the interview, Zac seems enamored with Zendaya, but Zendaya is a little distracted. This is most likely because the interviewer’s hair won’t stay down and she wants to fix it again. Yea I said again because at the beginning of the interview she actually fixes his hair.

Good job Zendaya! He probably freaked out when you fixed his hair. I know I would have, but I have no hair for you to fix because I shave my head. Anyway, right after Zendaya fixed it, the hair popped back up and she does not look amused.

That one piece of hair continued to make a cameo throughout the interview, but hey, it made for an entertaining interview. Anyway, what do you think about what Zac had to say about his kiss with Zendaya, and would you have fixed the interviewer’s hair too?

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday and Friday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

► Curiosidades

1. Esta es una Película Original Disney Channel. Se estrenó el 15 de abril del 2011. 
2. La cinta está basada en la novela con el mismo nombre escrita por Mark Peter Hughes. 
3. El colegio que vemos en la película es real. Y está ubicado en Albuquerque, Nuevo México.
4. Aunque no lo parezca Blake Michael tenía tan solo 13 años de edad, durante la filmación. 
5. En la película, Stella acaba de mudarse de Rhode Island. Esto fue una referencia al lugar donde  se ambientó la novela original.
6. Tres de los actores que participaron en esta cinta, aparecieron como personajes recurrentes, en “Los Hechiceros de Waverly Place”. 
7. Hayley Kiyoko tuvo que cortarse el cabello seis veces antes de que fuera lo adecuado para su personaje. 
8. En la película se dice que la madre de Olivia falleció. Sin embargo, en el libro su madre la abandonó. 
9. El actor Adam Hicks, quien interpretó a Wen, escribió por sí mismo la parte del rap en esa canción. 
10. Mark Peter Hughes, el autor de la novela, hizo un cameo en la película. 
11. Cuando se estrenó esta película, muy pocos conocían a Naomi Scott. Pero en el 2017 logró hacerse conocer mucho más por la adaptación cinematográfica de los Power Rangers, donde interpretó a la Ranger rosa.  
12. En la novela, Mohini logra superar a Scott y termina enamorándose de Charlie. Sin embargo, en la película ella le da a Scott otra oportunidad y deja al pobre Charlie en friendzone. 
13. El comentario que hace el director Brenigan sobre su pasado rebelde, es un guiño al papel que tuvo el actor en la película “Grease 2”.
14. La película tiene una escena post-créditos que no está presente en la versión televisiva. En esta se hacen algunas confesiones amorosas y finalizan cantando un nuevo tema.  
15. Tras el éxito que la cinta logró tener, se había planeado una secuela. Pero más tarde Disney Channel la canceló.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WF4VzRZ1pZk/sddefault.jpg,0.04574514165926908,0.0004318228002438529,105.93498452012385,0.003663140782254357,0.046176964459512936,0.04984010524176729,2017-11-17,21:37:41,Friday,4,11,49,11,49,62,435,1,86,0,0,4,44,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5204338732204885,2,"['scared', 'sad']",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,{'person': 3},3

Space launch involves liftoff, when a rocket or other space launch vehicle leaves the ground, floating ship or midair aircraft at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types: rocket launch (the current conventional method), and non-rocket spacelaunch (where other forms of propulsion are employed, including airbreathing jet engines or other kinds).

Rocket launch is the only current way to reach space. In some cases an airbreathing (jet engine) first stage has been used as well.Non-rocket space launch is a launch into space where some or all of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than expendable rockets. A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed. In some systems such as Skyhooks, rocket sled launch, and air launch, a rocket is used to reach orbit, but it is only part of the system.

Story Behind the Song

What if Bach wrote O Holy Night? Then THIS angel would have to sing it.

O Holy Night has graced Christmas for 170 years since its inception. It has earned a place among the greatest carols of all time. But such fame can breed vapid familiarity. 170 years of airtime can acclimate the ear so much that we may not feel the Holiness of O Holy Night as perhaps we once did. Unless, perhaps, its transcendent lyrics were cast into a new mold? A mold created by, none other than, J.S. Bach.

We hope this unity of O Holy Night’s lyrics and Ave Maria’s melody opens your ears and heart to the inspiration woven into each line of its immortal meaning:

“Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth…
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn...
O Night Divine! When Christ was born.”

Some subjects are so sacred that it takes an extraordinarily gifted and virtuous person to perform them properly — in a way that is so authentically radiant that as we listen it draws out the light inherent in each and every one of us.

Presenting the precocious, the radiant, earth angel, 15-year-old, Lexi Walker -- an incomparable voice attached to an inimitable heart.

We filmed this video in the middle of the night on tour between two shows at Tuacahn. The stars shone brightly, the river flowed peacefully and we simply let the stillness of the night do the performing for us. Merry Christmas no matter the time of year or circumstances that brought you to this piece!

“The world says: ""You have needs -- satisfy them. You have as much right as the rich and the mighty. Don't hesitate to satisfy your needs; indeed, expand your needs and demand more."" This is the worldly doctrine of today. And they believe that this is freedom. The result for the rich is isolation and suicide, for the poor, envy and murder.”
― Fyodor Dostoyevsky

The music video for “Selfish” is a part of the visual presentation of “Edgewood”.

About the series: 
Four children with four exceptional gifts – a computer genius, a violin virtuoso, a star gymnast and a dazzling chess player. What is it like to be one in 100,000 or even one in a million? 

From friendships gained and families uprooted, it’s a fragile balance between pursuing their potential and not losing their childhood innocence. What hidden sacrifices do these wonder kids and the people around them make to fulfil their grand ambitions ?

But we were able to see it for a minute before we left and it was really fun. We also had some amazing character interactions which really turned our whole day around. It was really awesome! We had some food while we waited for Christmastown to open too, the ribs were good but a little dry and the chicken and waffle sandwich was pretty good too! We showed some of Sheikra although the line was really long so we didn't ride it, but we totally recommend it! Then we head into Christmastown and we saw the train set and met Snowflake the Snowman and it really was worth the wait, we had a lot of fun in there. Christmastime might just be the best time in Florida! We hope you enjoyed our holiday coverage as much as we did! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

This week we visited the beautiful island of Nusa Lembongan in South East Asia for a day of diving. We stopped at Manta Point and it was stunning; on the surface of the water that is... We saw huge Manta Rays swimming underneath the boat and it all seemed so magical. But then we went underneath the oceans surface...I honestly could have just burst into tears then and there. I have never been so horrified and heartbroken as I was when I saw the amount of plastic and rubbish in the bay. These beautiful creatures swimming amongst the mess that we as humans have created. The Manta’s had plastic bags around their mouths and on their bodies whilst swimming around the rubbish in search for food. This rubbish is brought in from various parts of the globe from currents and tides which means we are ALL to blame. EVERYTHING goes back into the ocean.. #putitinthebin
Scientists have predicted that by the year 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than there are fish!! THAT IS 32 YEARS FROM NOW - WITHIN OUR LIFETIME!! This past year I have really started to limit my use of plastic and I am privileged enough to live in a country where avoiding plastic and recycling is really quite simple! For example, refusing plastic straws, using a keepcup when purchasing coffee, taking re-usable bags when buying groceries, buying unpackaged food and recycling everything you possibly can. Even when travelling I’ve really tried to limit my use of plastic and waste and encourage those I travel with to do the same. 
It just completely breaks my heart that the ocean is suffering at a mass extent due to our careless behaviour and lack of knowledge. What you can’t see can’t hurt I guess but without the ocean and it’s ecosystem there is no us! And it is declining rapidly. More importantly, beautiful animals like these shouldn’t have to suffer because of us. 
Please share this video to reach out and spread awareness on the state of our oceans and please try to limit your use of non-reusable plastic and waste. #conservation #saynotoplastic #putitinthebin #recycle #take3forthesea #oceanawareness #girlsthatscuba #oceanconservation

EDIT: To reiterate - We are ALL to blame. This is a GLOBAL issue and we are ALL affected by it. Plastic is distributed in the ocean from ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD and carried by tides and currents. Rather than blaming others for this, we need to support and educate each other. If each and every one of us did our own bit - The greater the impact would be.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WLWN2rM-8sw/sddefault.jpg,0.0069941185821014145,0.00015895724050230488,44.0,0.0015895724050230488,0.0071530758226037204,0.008742648227626769,2018-02-19,08:42:20,Monday,0,6,32,6,30,38,299,0,62,0,0,2,1,1,3,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.385677986200934,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Welcome back to the latest version of the best electric skateboard you can buy! 2017 was an interesting year in which many of the big brands did not meet their targeted release dates which disappointed many customers in the first half of 2017.

The Acton Blink S and S2 finally started shipping at the half year mark. Mellow began fulfillment of their kickstarter orders, Boosted got to grips with their battery problem and it seems that the Enertion raptor 2 is getting their second batch ready for shipment and the release date looks to be April 20, 2018,  They are now taking pre-orders.

Besides the Evolve Bamboo GTX, there are not a lot of newcomers in the list!  The new brands that are forthcoming need to prove their product worthiness.  We look forwarding to reviewing them this year.  We anticipate reviewing the Metroboards, Long Haired Boy, Carvon and the many others that didn't made it in the list but really should have!

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

Find out more about Pokémon GO Travel: http://www.pokemongolive.com/travel

Ever since Pokémon GO launched, we've loved hearing stories of Trainers venturing abroad and playing together with new friends from different countries. That's what inspired us to create Pokémon GO Travel, a new way to see the world through the eyes of a Pokémon Trainer. To kick things off, Pokémon GO Travel is taking a diverse group of Trainers from around the world to Japan to host our first-ever Global Catch Challenge.
 
Join us as we discover new places, meet new people, and work together in an attempt to catch 3 billion Pokémon in just 7 days. Play along with IHasCupquake, Coisa de Nerd, and Rachel Quirico as they travel to learn more about Japanese culture, inspire the world to play together, and update you on the amazing rewards the community unlocks along the way—including Farfetch’d appearing worldwide for a limited time!
 
On a trip? Venturing to a new part of town? Share your #PokemonGOtravel story with us this week on your favorite social media channels.

MIDNIGHT SUN is a romantic tearjerker about 17-year-old Katie Price (Bella Thorne), sheltered at home since childhood with a rare genetic condition, a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight.  Having only her father Jack (Rob Riggle) for company, Katie's world opens up after dark when she ventures outside to play her guitar.  One night, her dreams come true when she's noticed and asked out by her longtime crush Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger), whom she's secretly watched from her bedroom window for years.  As they embark on nightly summer excursions, Katie's risk to sunlight grows and she's presented with the gut-wrenching dilemma of whether she can live a normal life with her newfound soul mate.

Brian and Jason were going to make a DIY breathalyzer but they got as far as breathing into a tube when they realized they could just invent a new type of weapon. Some sort of... breathgun.

Make no mistake this is a weapon and is dangerous, so treat it as such. Use common sense, check your local laws, respect the safety of yourself and others, and at the end of the day maybe just don't even make one.

Remember these secret tricks to protect yourself.  
About one million cars are stolen in the US each year. The biggest targets are Toyota, Honda, and General Motors vehicles. According to the thieves themselves, this is because these cars are a little easier to steal and their spare parts are in high demand. 
New-generation car thieves are using gadgets to steal vehicles. Criminals are hacking into the latest “keyless” systems to enter the newest models. Criminals copy and reproduce your car's VIN to organize a huge fraud scheme. Another way car thieves get close to your vehicle is by posing as, for example, mechanics. Some thieves will hang out around grocery stores and major supermarkets and stalk their prey, so to say.

SUMMARY
-Criminals have an announcement made that your car is blocking theirs and attack you as you rush to the car.
-New-generation car thieves use complicated signal pinging to open your car, so if you have a car with keyless entry, get a special radio signal deactivation option.
-Criminals copy and reproduce your car's VIN to organize a huge fraud scheme.
-Service your car in trusted places only. 
-Thieves set the alarm off in your car in the dead of night to make you disable it. 
-Some thieves wait for a lone shopper to walk to their car in the parking lot and attack them. 
-The coin used by thieves prevents the lock on one of the doors from working, the owner walks away, and the thieves get in.

Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ordered Mill to be released from prison on bail two weeks ago. Back in November, a judge ordered him to serve up to four years for violating his probation after a 2008 conviction on drug and weapons charges. Mill is appealing that conviction. Many activists claim Mill's treatment was unfair and harsh. Meek Mill and his attorney, Joe Tacopina, join ""CBS This Morning"" for their first live TV interview since Mill's release.

Lyrics:

Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place
To come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a
Little bit better when you plan it... oh


So won't you send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you oh
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place
To come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but youuu ohh
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

But some of the fans are not exactly feeling empathetic. An the streets are talking. It’s Justin Diego with another Binge-worthy video and today let’s talk about Wendy Williams and the shade she’s throwing at Kenya Moore, Kandi Burruss and the whole Real Housewives of Atlanta cast.

Wendy Williams Slams RHOA Season 10 Stars: Kenya Moore Is Fake & Kandi Is Boring

This season we’re getting to see a different side of Kenya Moore where she’s calmer and more likable, but is it too late to change her image?

After last sunday’s breakdown, fans are finally starting to see that she actually has a heart.


Wendy Williams isn’t buying Kenya Moore’s sob story and gave her some tough advice about marriage, and with the rumor’s about Wendy’s husbands running thru the streets of the tristate smashing everything with a moist body cavity, she certainly is one to talk.


I just think it’s funny that Wendy is always so tough on the brown girls of RHOA. She lights up and campaigns for the other housewives in a way that she never does about Atlanta that certainly rubbing RHOA fans the wrong way.

On top of her rant about Kenya being kicked off the show, Wendy Williams slammed Kandi for still doing Reality TV and says Xscape will be just fine without her.

I am a fan of Wendy but it’s days like this that I regret not laughing at her statue of liberty episode a few weeks ago.

Do you think Wendy is being too hard on the Real Housewives of Atlanta, or is she right about Kenya and Kandi?

""CATHARSIS"" LYRICS

I feel so empty and alone, I wonder
If this is ever going to go away
Cause now this changes everything
 
Smash all your sacred cows
Break all your sacred vows
Never look down on me
What you get, what you see
I could never be another brick in the wall
You’ll remember me 
As you break all our spirits down and push us to the ground
Call me a fool with a gasoline can
Burn it fucking down, start it over and over again
 
Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You’re there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You’re there to watch me crumble
But you won’t get your chance
 
And so I sink into the grey horizon
I’m never going to let you say “I can’t”
I’ll never let you beat me to the ground
 
So can you see the hunger in my eyes?
Take a look, it’s no disguise
Got to crush my struggles, crush the pain and the strife
Live or die, I'm gonna fight for my life tonight
 
Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You’re there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You’re there to watch me crumble
But you won’t get your chance
You’ll never get your chance
 
The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
Can you feel my catharsis?
 
Can, you, feel my catharsis
Can, you, feel my catharsis
The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
This is my catharsis
 
Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You’re there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You’re there to watch me crumble

But you won’t get your chance
You’ll never get your chance
 
The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
Can you feel my catharsis?
 
This is my catharsis!

This video explains NAT Type 1 PS4 connection and how to get it. I explained how to get NAT Type 1 on PS4 and which Internet connection services are not able to get NAT Type 1 on PS4. Satellite Internet providers and wireless Internet hotspots will not be able to get NAT Type 1 on PS4. Getting NAT Type 1 on PS4 is actually very easy. However PS4 Nat Type 1 is not better than NAT Type 2. NAT Type 1 on PS4 just means your PS4 has a public IP address and all ports are directed at your PS4.

Bluff, Utah has a few hotel-motels, RV sites with tent sites, a couple good restaurants, and one place to get gasoline and supplies.  Comb Ridge Bistro is excellent for coffee and food.  

I chose to stay the first night at Sand Island which is very near the south entrance to Comb Ridge.  Sand Island is a semi primitive campsite with a nice host family, dry toilets, potable water, fire rings, a few grills, picnic tables and lots of blow sand.  If tent camping prepare for the blow sand.    Campground was very quite and cost $15/night.   

The sites included in this trip were;

Wolfman Panel and Ruins
Big Crane site
Double Stack Ruins
Procession Panel
Monarch Ruin
Cold Spring Ruin
Split Level  Ruin
Fishmouth Cave and Ruin

Butler Wash Road was very well graded and did not have to utilize 4WD.  Road was much better than the Coyote Gulch road for comparison.  Many free, primitive campsites are available along Butler Wash and I felt very safe in this area primarily due to the lack of people.  

ATT Cell phone coverage was good in Bluff, Sand Island but was marginal along Butler Wash.  Sometimes up on the Comb itself you could get coverage.   Deep in the canyons though,  even my Garmin GPS failed to pick up any signal and Gaiagps stopped functioning.  

By far my favorite locations were Cold Spring Ruin and Procession Panel.  All ruins and petroglyph panels were easy to find and get to, except for Procession Panel.  I followed the many Procession Panel cairns but one cairn path routed me to a steep approach so had to back track and choose a less sketchy route.  Best to drop into the canyon as soon as you can instead of proceeding higher up on top of the Comb.  

I did not see much of any wildlife while there.   I did see large cat tracks inside Cold Spring Cave and a few in the drainage areas.  I did not see any snakes but a snake track of one inside Cold Spring Cave.  

All of the area was very clean and just a few instances of vandalism.  The hiker pottery ""museums"" are becoming abundant and would like to discourage people from doing this and leave the sites as you found them.  

Weather in early April was amazing.  I made sure to time the trip based along no rain forecasts.  Temperature was in the high 20s one night and during the day it would warm up to the 70s.  Very low humidity so hydration important.  

Hard to recommend on how many days you will need.  I chose 4 days and this was perfect and allowed me to explore some of the river ruins.    

In regard to the video, I chose to include many minutes of driving the Butler Wash road.  I wish that this had been available to me prior so I could get an idea what condition the road would be in.  I also included ""excessive"" footage of the Procession Panel.  Many people were asking questions about the glyphs and thought this would give people an idea of the ""procession"" characters.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_6wo-uWPAw/sddefault.jpg,0.015731515469323543,0.0,inf,0.0,0.015731515469323543,0.015731515469323543,2018-04-21,16:58:49,Saturday,5,6,67,6,58,36,531,0,100,0,0,5,54,0,4,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.256902209556987,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

We hiked up and down 80km of the Madeira mountains during those 5 days, lucky we had John from Freeride Madeira who could guide us around and make sure we got to all corners of the island and showed it's variety on offer.

When asked about whether he would be returning as Cap to the MCU after ‘Avengers 4’, Evans “You want to get off the train before they push you off.” This is not the first time Evans has hinted that he will be leaving the franchise.

So if you want to see lots of forging fun, blacksmithing badassery, cinematic hammering and more in my Daily Vlog (#Daily_Steele) - please subscribe here by hitting that red button!

We went on a slip n slide through a mystery box while letting my instagram followers control my life for a day in this backyard challenge.  You decide which water slide we go down and which food item is used inside the cardboard box.  The items you had to chose from included, chocolate syrup, ketchup and mustard, honey, maple syrup, confetti, mayo, jelly and even feathers.  We saw other youtubers like FaZe Rug do this challenge with his dad, Brothers Cam and Jeff and husband and wife Chad Wild Clay and Vy Quaint.  For the final round we combined all of the ingredients into one giant hidden mystery box challenge.  Also, for a bonus a rescue dog tried one of the slides for the first time.

As of right now, we know where the Tesseract or Space Stone, Time Stone, Realty Stone or Aether, Power Stone, and Mind Stone are located. The Space Stone was on Asgard and is now with Loki after Thor Ragnarok. The Mind Stone is inside Vision’s forehead while the Time Stone is inside the Eye of Agamotto protected by Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange. The Power Stone is protected by the Nova Corps on Xandar. Finally, the Collector is in the possession of the Aether aka Reality Stone over on Knowhere.

Each of the stones is incredibly powerful and most of their powers haven’t been seen in the MCU. It would be awesome to see what Thanos does with these stones in Avengers Infinity War. Where do you think the Soul Stone is hidden? In Wakanda with Black Panther? MAYBE! Let me know your theories down below or on twitter @sambashor!

LYRICS:

I was living on the hill
By the water tower and hiking trails
When the big one hit I’d have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Come on baby it’s time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

These LA phonies and their bullshit bands
Just sounds like dollar signs and
So reads the pull quote of my last cover piece
Entitled “The Oldest Man In Folk Rock Speaks”
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them bout the time that they don't have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

A few things the songwriter needs
Arrows of love, a mask of tragedy
But if you want ecstasy, or birth control
Just run the tap until the water’s cold
Anything else you can get online
Comic gold or a .45
You’re going to need one or the other to survive
Where only the armed or the funny make it out alive

Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews
Just believably a little north of God’s own truth
He’s a national treasure now and here’s the proof
In the form of his major label-debut
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
I swear I never do this, but is it okay
Don’t want to be that guy but it’s my birthday
If everything ends in a photo then I’m on my way

Mara taunts me ‘neath the tree
She’s like “Oh, great, that’s just what they all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously”
She’s not far off, the strange this is
That’s just what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to play the G
But the role of Oedipus was just a total breeze

I watch my old gods all collapse
Whoam way more violent than my cartoon past
It’s like my father said before he croaked
“Son, you’re killing me” and “That's all folks!”
So why is it I’m so distraught
That what I’m selling’s getting bought
At some point you can’t control
What people use your fake name for

So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there’s always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn’t use
Nonetheless, I’ve been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and just getting by
Until I figured if I’m here than I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlight
Maya the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming teenage rosebuds dirty talk
And I’m merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I’m beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them
Some 10 verse chorus-less diatribe
Plays as they all jump ship, I used to like this guy
But this new shit makes me want to die

My earliest memory of music’s from
The time at JC Penny’s with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming “Someone, help my son”
I relive it most times the radio’s on
That Tell Me Lies, Sweet Little White lies song
That’s when I first heard the comedy won’t stop for
All the little boys dying in department stores

So we leave town in total silence
New Years Day at 6 o’clock am
Never seen Sunset this abandoned
Reminds me predictably of the world’s end
It’ll be good to get more space
God knows what all these suckers pay  
I can stop drinking and you can write your script
What we both think now is

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is a big event on the fashion calendar, but there’s the official version that’s aired to viewers around the world, and then there’s the untold story of what really goes on backstage. There’s so much gossip that we can’t wait to share with you. We’re delving into that untold story of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2017 in our video.

There are some VS Angels like Adriana Lima that let a few secrets out the bag, and they’re fascinating bits of information. Sara Sampaio and Lais Ribeiro paint a healthy picture of model prep. But it’s so interesting to learn about the pre-show pressure from former Victoria’s Secret models, like Erin Heatherton and Kylie Bisutti, who are ready to dish the dirt about the exercise and eating regimes they’re given.

There were runway mishaps that you might not have caught this year, like Ming Xi’s fall and other Angel’s wardrobe malfunction. Of course, the show doesn’t end when the models step off the runway. The after-party came to a shocking close, too.

Then there are the controversial no-shows, like performer Katy Perry and models Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. Find out what role the GigiGetOutOfChina hashtag might have played in that. And learn about the real reason Kendall wasn’t walking this year. All these Victoria’s Secret controversies are waiting for you to watch right here.

Watch our video to discover the untold story of the Victorias Secret Fashion Show, and tell us in comments which Angel is your favorite.

Watch a new sneak peak of #WrinkleinTime.

Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres in 3D March 9th!
From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.

If our bonding is strong and we are securely attached, then we feel safe to explore the world. If our bond is weak, we feel insecurely attached. We are afraid to leave or explore a rather scary-looking world. Because we are not sure if we can return. Often we then don't understand our own feelings.

Dealing with Attachment Issues:
Dealing with Attachment Issues is no easy task. For those who feel like they can’t help themselves, or can’t find trust through their partners of family, we recommend looking for professional support through a therapy.

If you are able to form a secure attachment to a therapist, he can become the one who provides you with that secure base.

Here three of possible therapies:

1. Psychoanalysis. The aim of psychoanalysis therapy is to release repressed emotions and experiences, i.e., make the unconscious conscious. In order to do that, the therapist might try to bring back some childhood memories, to work at the root cause of the problem.

2. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT is a psycho-social intervention that is widely used for improving mental health. Instead of trying to bring you back in time, it aims to explain to you what's going on inside your brain and how to cope with irrational feelings or fears.

3. The Hoffmann Process. This 7-8 day's guided process, designed by the American psychologist Hoffmann, brings participants back into their childhood to reconnect with their parents at the time when an attachment is formed. It's very intensive.

Our fire ants, yellow crazy ants, and black crazy ants have never experienced living with aquatic companions like these! In this video our young Polyrhachis semiinermis ant colony (Lesser weaver ants) are under threat of attack from wild pharaoh ants who are looking to invade our new ant island named ""El Dragon"" situated in our brand new paludarium. In this episode we choose a guardian beast to unleash into El Dragon's waters, as well as go over what steps are needed in order to make sure our new El Dragon guardians are able to survive! This is an info-packed and intense episode with an unexpected, twist ending that will blow you away!

When you’re a billionaire bachelor, there isn’t much out of your reach, especially not beautiful women. The women on this list have snagged themselves some rich husbands and boyfriends, and there is one thing they all have in common: they are all drop dead gorgeous. These are 15 of the most beautiful wives of older billionaires. In this video, we are going to take a look at some of the stunning women who take the arms of some wealthy older men. Like Princess Charlene of Monaco who married Prince Albert, who is 20 years her senior. Then there’s Jade Foret, who married one of France’s most powerful men, Arnaud Lagardére, who happens to be 30 years older than her. We will also take a look at which lady Jim Goldstein, that guy you see on the floor at every Lakers game, is hanging with these days.  When you’re finished watching the video, tell us what you think and don’t forget to subscribe to TheTalko!

--

Schoolboys Scott (Richard Mason) and Sid (Tom Blyth) are isolated, underachieving and a little lost when Scott transfers to Sid’s school as a teen. Sid is the withdrawn, awkward son of an alcoholic mother and absent father, who just wants to work hard, get through his exams and escape into his own life.

Scott, meanwhile, is an unloved foster child who’s been expelled from multiple schools, rootless and uncontainable. Neither receives much encouragement from their parents or teachers, but as their friendship takes root they find something in each other that enables them to glimpse a bigger goal.

Despairing of the compromise and limited ambitions around them, and in defiance of the low expectations that everyone has for them, Scott and Sid write a list of goals and begin pursuing each one in turn to create a better life. The withdrawn, overly serious Sid is inspired by Scott’s wild and untamed spirit, while Scott draws strength from Sid’s boundless work ethic and determination to get ahead.

They become ‘Dreamchasers’, building their whole lifestyle and ideology around pushing themselves farther and faster than anyone expects. Fuelled by ambition and entrepreneurial spirit they launch two successful businesses while still at school, and by their late teens they’re reaching for the stars – even if it means putting themselves in real danger from gangsters and loan sharks.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wom_laz1cnw/hqdefault.jpg,0.002114523846272573,0.0001543448062972681,13.7,0.00018521376755672168,0.002268868652569841,0.002454082420126563,2018-01-04,17:17:38,Thursday,3,8,14,8,14,37,196,1,40,1,0,4,2,1,0,4.0,13.0,"['U', 'IY', 'VANTILIE!', ') alk']","['U', 'IY', 'VANTILIE!', ')', 'alk']",True,"['U', 'IY', 'vantili', '!', ')', 'alk']",6,6,15,2,2,1,0,6.156126433887544,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

""Manly man Pete Hegseth, appearing on Fox Business Network Friday morning, had manly words for “boy band” singer Justin Timberlakeover the Super Bowl performer’s recent remarks that he will never let his son play football.

Hegseth, who appeared on Stuart Varney’s show from a diner in Minneapolis with a pigskin in hand, dismissed Timberlake’s concerns for the health and safety of his offspring as a sign of our emasculated times.

“This guy was in a boy band, I think his son will be much more qualified to be in a boy band,” Hegseth quipped. “It’s a lot safer on stage than it is on a football field, right?” (Tell that to XXXTentacion…)
The Fox & Friends weekend host continued that Timberlake’s comments are all part of the great war between the “elites” and the common man:

“Come on, this indicative of the way the elites see football, and tough sports and manhood, frankly,” Hegseth said. “You learn things when you get hit.””*

Kristen Bell is making history as the first ever host of the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and she’s certainly making sure it’s a night to remember.

Kristen Bell opened up the SAG Awards with a killer monologue that was shady AF.

Okay, you guys… It’s the 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, and in case you didn’t already know, the incredible Kristen Bell is hosting, which is iconic in more ways than one. 

First and foremost, she’s the first host that the SAG Awards has EVER had, period. Secondly, with gender equality and the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements at the forefront of everyone’s minds, it’s obviously extremely significant that the first host of the show, after 23 years with no host, is a woman. 

And, as the first host, Kristen started off the evening strong with an opening monologue that made a hilarious reference to the fact that she was the quote-unquote “first lady” of the SAG Awards. She said, QUOTE, “I never thought I’d grow up to be the first lady, but you know what? I kinda like it.” Yeah… it’s a nice life!

But, as we all know, every “first lady” needs an initiative, right? So, like someone else we all know— cough, cough, Melania Trump – Kristen has also decided to tackle the problem of cyberbullying, since, you know, the actual first lady hasn’t done a ton to solve the problem.

OMG… the shade is REAL, guys! 

And even though Kristen started off her monologue joking about Melania’s failure to do, well, anything at all, she went on to explain the importance of SAG Awards, and the need we have for actors to make unheard voices heard through the art of storytelling. 

Overall, the monologue was the perfect balance between funny and inspirational, but most importantly, she answered the question ALL of us have been waiting to get an answer for. 

Anyways, while we’re waiting for that Frozen sequel, let us know what you think about Kristen’s opening monologue in the comments below, and then click to the left to see the best-dressed celebs at the SAG Awards. Thanks for watching Clevver News. I’m your host Renee Shafii and I’ll see you next time!

One of the major argument points is around CHIP, which is a health insurance program that covers about 9 million kids and has yet to be re-authorized more than 100 days after it expired. The Republicans are lumping CHIP into their spending bill, but they should really be taking a separate vote to ensure it passes instead of using children’s health as leverage. It’s complicated, but Jimmy has a way to illustrate what’s going on that will hopefully make sense in our latest edition of Barista Theatre.

We wanted to give you a guys a pretty in depth tour of the park and look at the rides you can experience there! We rode the World's Tallest Sky Coaster and that was an intense ride to do first thing in the morning lol. We also rode the wild mouse coaster, Mine Blower (they're wooden coaster with an inversion), the compressed air assisted swing ride and their go kart tracks too! A big thank you to Fun Spot America for allowing us to give you guys a closer look at the park and the rides! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

Following is a transcript of the video:

This asteroid is not from around here. Turns out, it came from another star system. This is the first time humanity has observed an interstellar object.

Astronomers discovered it on Oct. 19. At first, they thought it was a comet. But its orbit was unlike anything ever seen before, and it was traveling at unusually high speeds: 85,700 mph.

So, astronomers reclassified the object as an interstellar asteroid. Asteroids in our solar system are usually round and lumpy.  But this object probably looks more like a giant cigar. Observations suggest it's about a quarter mile long. Right now, it's about 124 million miles from Earth.

Over the next 2 years, it will pass by Jupiter and Saturn's orbits. Astronomers predict it will leave our solar system in Jan. 2019. Making its way into deep space toward the constellation Pegasus.

It may be the first interstellar visitor, but the bigger question is: Will it be the last?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WvD_-WCKh1g/sddefault.jpg,0.024723888546280205,0.0005326007736727029,46.42105263157895,0.004183719235297416,0.025256489319952908,0.029440208555250324,2017-11-21,23:53:27,Tuesday,1,5,15,5,15,46,153,0,40,0,2,5,12,0,0,8.0,9.0,"['ASTRONOMERS', 'DISCOVER FIRST _', 'TESA GXel:W isons']","['ASTRONOMERS', 'DISCOVER', 'FIRST', '_', 'TESA', 'GXel:W', 'isons']",True,"['astronom', 'discov', 'first', '_', 'tesa', 'gxel', ':', 'W', 'ison']",9,9,34,2,1,1,0,6.198371098602438,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

In this street food tour vlog, we travel outside of Oaxaca city to Zachilla, to eat and try the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous lamb barbacoa inside soft spicy tacos, as well as the most beautiful spicy BEST BBQ Chicken with tons of amazing spicy salsa. It was truly the best barbecue chicken! This was such a big adventure to go out and eat these amazing Mexican street foods.

The Best Street Food we found, was definitely the Mexican ice cream, which was made by the most amazing man, the Ice cream NINJA of Mexico! The ice cream was hand made and made so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast!

The first thing we found in the local street food market outside of Oaxaca, Mexico, was the famous whole lamb barbacoa, it was incredibly juicy, soft, and covered with a slightly spicy chili sauce and served wrapped up in a tortilla  with lots of delicious salsa and guacamole. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing spicy and variation of dishes you can try in the local farmers markets like this one outside of Oaxaca, Mexico. All of the Mexican cuisine makes your mouth come alive , especially when you get to watch the cooking, in the outdoor kitchen AKA the street!

After that amazing Mexican barbacoa tacos, we continued exploring the farmers market  and found some delicious BBQ Chicken! It was truly MONSTER sized, flavoured with adobado sauce and lots of different spicy salsa. Watching it covered in the adobado marinade and sizzling on the grill was truly amazing! The smell combined with the juices bursting out of the meat was life changing! This is the true beauty of Mexican food, the spice, the atmosphere, and the variety of tons of street foods to try in Mexico!

After this, we found some world famous Mexican milk ice cream, known as Nieves, famous from Oaxaca. There were so many amazing flavours to try, but we went for the classic burnt milk flavour with “tuna”, also known as the fruit from the prickly pear cactus. This combo was very delicious and worth a try for sure! The most amazing thing about this was watching how fast they made the ice cream, with super human skill. They were truly fast workers, with GOD LEVEL skill!  They were some of the fastest workers I’ve ever seen! It was hand made ice cream and in order to freeze it, they had to spin the tub really fast. Watching them make it was amazing! The workers here at the ice cream shop had super human skill, spinning it so fast with incredible speed and precision! This was GOD LEVEL skill! It was so fun to watch!

The address for this farmers market is just a few KM outside of Oaxaca. It is in the town of Zachilla, which hosts the market every Thursday.

This couple loves to travel and were greatly inspired by European style in their build, especially when it came to the interior decor of the home. The entire place was constructed by the couple as a DIY build for the unbelievable price of only $15,000, largely thanks to the amount of reclaimed materials that have gone into the tiny home's construction.

But as much variety as there is to be found in the latter, and as solidly reliable as each platform has become, the fact remains that we're now trapped in a somewhat dull duopoly. 

Sailfish OS is not here to save us. The platform, which first saw wide release in 2013 but traces its roots all the way back to the heyday of Nokia, doesn't have enough momentum to topple the entrenched competition (nor do its custodians seem to yearn for such an upset). But for those who simply can't brook the idea of toting an Apple- or Google-powered smartphone, the mere existence of Sailfish OS as an alternative choice is reason to celebrate. And for the rest of us, who defected to one of the two evil empires long ago but still yearn for some innovative influences on these predictable platforms, Sailfish serves as a refreshing reservoir of new ideas (and friendly fonts). Join me for a quick look at this rarely-seen platform in MrMobile's Sailfish OS hands-on!

[ABOUT MRMOBILE'S SAILFISH OS HANDS-ON]

MrMobile's Sailfish OS Hands-On was produced following several weeks of on-and-off usage with Sailfish X running on a Sony Xperia X on loan from Jolla. The device was not unlocked for the North American market and so it was used exclusively on WiFi.

Using a DTV Shredder as a base, we created our very own TANK SNOW PLOW! We created a metal weldment to attach a standard snow shovel to the front of the shredder -- a few springs insure we won't flip over the handle bars, and the build is complete! It was an easy project, but lots of fun!

Pororo is looking for a friends who can play with him everyday. Would you like to be his friend? Who wants to meet Pororo in real life?

EPISODE 1
Yujung spends fun time with a toy Pororo, but she suddenly gets bored of this stinky toy. She wishes that she could play with real Pororo. Meanwhile, Pororo breaks into Yujung’s room and amazed by all the toys in her room. Yujung and Pororo bump into each other and promise that they always will be by each other. Pororo tells Yujung to keep the secret about his presence. Oops! Yujung’s mom seems like she notices that Yujung acts strange. Will Pororo be fine?

EPISODE 2
If you are asking why this real Pororo suddenly appeared in human’s village, he got banished from Porong Porong Village. Pororo needs to complete a mission of collecting smiles from people. His first target is Yujung. He thinks about the ways he can make Yujung smiles. He starts to clean up her room but it isn’t so easy for little Pororo. His intention was very kind but he ends up creating all the mess instead.

EPISODE 3
Wow! Pororo gains a magic wand from the wizard Tongtong. Kids often dream about transporting, being an invisible man, or flying on a broom stick like Harry Porter. In this video clip, Pororo visited a girl who is a big fan of him and her wish for meeting a real Pororo finally becomes true. Pororo plans to make Yujung happy with this magic wand. Oh! By the way, what would you want to be, if you were a wizard, parents?

EPISODE 4
Pororo decides to make Yujung’s belongings to princess’ items such as a crown, a shining dress, and a pink bracelet. And Pororo plans all of these for a surprise while Yujung is still at school. But something bad happens to Pororo. He tries to hide behind the curtains, and suddenly strong wind from open window blows little Pororo out of the house. What would happen to Pororo next?

EPISODE 5
Friends! Help Pororo. He’s kidnapped by a naughty boy named Minjun at a trampoline park. Even though Pororo succeeded to make Yujung happy, he pulled himself into a nightmare. Minjun treats him like a doll and Pororo feels it’s too harsh for him. Pororo tries to run out of his hands but he fails it again and again. What could he do to see Yujung again? Maybe Pororo needs your help, friends!

EPISODE 6 Escape from the strange room, Pororo!
Pororo is locked in a strange room by a naughty boy named Minjun. Pororo must get through few missions to unlock the password to way out. Even though there are a lot of toys he loves in the room, he feels nervous for being left by himself. Where is Yujung, tho? Is she at school or at the playground? It’s time for Pororo to be wise and look for clues to escape from the strange room. Will he be able to escape and meet Yujung again?

EPISODE 7
Pororo wants revenge on Yujung’s best friend Minjun for locking him in the strange room. He makes Minjun embarrassing by pooping on the pound cake for Yujung. Pororo is jealous about these two friends playing house without him. “Gosh! Stop bugging me!” Minjun never stops teasing Pororo. So Pororo plans to do something mean while Minjun takes a nap. What would happen between these two?

EPISODE 8
A goblin is here at Yujung’s house and Pororo faces him in a toilet at night! Pororo is not afraid of him as long as he has the magic wand with him. Soon, they decide to compete for strength of each one’s magic wand. The goblin turns Pororo into a baby or makes him upside down. What magic skills would Pororo use for the revenge? Who would win the competition?

EPISODE 9
Pororo and Yujung are going to a field trip to a downtown, because Yujung has to do a favor for her mom. Pororo is willing to help Yujung to find her mom’s workplace. On the way to their destination, they hop off of the bus to look around a big toy store. It is time to use your magic wand, Pororo!  Will they get to mom’s workplace okay?

EPISODE 10
Pororo now wishes to go back to the Porong Porong village and meets his friends, Crong, Loopy, Petty, Eddy, and Poby. However, the king of the village named Bbulala is mad at Pororo for being lazy and not collecting any laughter from kids. Will he be able to go back to his village again? Pororo gets homesick and misses Loopy’s delicious foods and cookies. Wait! Is that Crong crying over there? Crong must be banished from the village as well. Oh gosh. What would happen to those two? Wait for the next season.

One of his notable works is a Basquiat-themed sculpture for Rihanna's 30th birthday. The piece took five months to complete, even though it was a six-step process! He finishes the clay sculpture with silicone to give the sculpture a fleshy texture. He then details the sculpture to be as realistic and similar-looking to his subject as possible.

🎤 Lyrics: Said The Sky & Kwesi - All I Got

I told you I would come back home
I know you hate to be alone
Instead of kissing you goodnight I'm kissing strangers
Always listen but I'll never learn
Shoulda been hanging on your every word
I was taking you for granted never realized the danger

And now I took too long
And now she's gone
If I only knew right from wrong
She'd be right back in my arms

All I got is you
All I got is you

I always meant to hold you closer
But I don't always do what I'm supposed to
Now you're slipping through my fingers and I don't know what to do
And I keep hoping you call back
Can we forget about the past
Cause baby all I really want is you

And now I took too long
And now she's gone
If I only knew right from wrong
She'd be right back in my arms

All I got is you
All I got is you

4am and I cannot say goodbye
Crawling back home id do anything for you
And I'm sitting up awake and now I can't forget you and I don't know what to do

All I got is you
All I got is you
All I got is you
All I got is you
All I got is you

MMA (Mexican Martial Arts) is the most practical martial arts system out there. It takes the foundation of what many other grand masters have created over centuries, and makes it more applicable on the streets today. A short list of martial arts systems to be improved upon during this series include: Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), Boxing, Taekwondo, American Kenpo, Muay Thai, Capoeira, Wrestling, Shotokan, Krav Maga, Aikido, Wing Chun, Kajukenbo, Hapkido, Jeet Kune Do, Sambo, Goju-ryu, Ninjutsu, Kyokushin, Silat, Sumo, Kickboxing, Kung Fu, and Jiu-jitsu.

Jesse has studied every one of these martial arts in order to make sure that his MMA system covers all bases. From revealing the flaws and shortcomings of these styles, to perfecting and better explaining the few things that they actually did right. With the help of his cousin Flaco, Jesse brings you free Mexican Martial Arts lessons to help protect yourself and your loved ones.

Also covered throughout this series are tips on boosting metabolism, displays of power and savageness, phony martial artists exposed, real world fight breakdowns, UFC event recaps, merchandise promos, MMA behind the scenes, and more.

These are all the sets in the day-one version of Monster Hunter World without DLC (only the first set of Horizon Zero Dawn gear is released thus far). More armor sets will release in the future.

Please note that every armor set has an Alpha and Beta version in High-Rank and they look slightly different or have a different color. So each of the timelinks below counts for two sets (the alpha & beta upgrade).

1) ‘Black Panther’ on Track to Be the MCU’s Highest Solo Story Opener Ever

2) LeBron James to Produce New Line’s House Party Reboot

3) Switch the Script

4) Dwayne Johnson Thwarts a Giant Monster Attack in New ‘Rampage’ Trailer

5) Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish Team for Mob Drama ‘The Kitchen’

6) ‘A Quiet Place’ Trailer: Monsters Hunt Emily Blunt and John Krasinski

7) Live Twitter Questions

THR is reporting that the box-office tracking outlet NRG is now counting a possible $165 million plus opening for the four-day President’s Day weekend for Black Panther. This is the same group who said Black Panther would top out around $125 million – then followed their report by updating the number to $150 million a week later. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, LeBron James, yes that LeBron James, is producing a new re-imagining of the classic 90’s comedy House Party. Atlanta’s Stephen Glover and Jamal Olori will pen the screenplay. “This is definitely not a reboot. It’s an entirely new look for a classic movie,” James told The Hollywood Reporter. 

SWITCH THE SCRIPT 

AGREE / DISAGREE 

Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema have released a new trailer for Rampage, Dwayne Johnson‘s latest action film that reteams him with his San Andreas director Brad Peyton. 

Deadline reports that Melissa McCarthy is finalizing a deal to join and star alongside Tiffany Haddish in The Kitchen; a movie that will be based on the comic book series by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle for DC’s Vertigo. The Kitchen is an Irish mafia story set in Hell’s Kitchen, New York in the 1970s after an FBI sweep catches some mob leaders forcing their wives to take over. 

Paramount Pictures has released a new A Quiet Place trailer for the upcoming horror film from director and star John Krasinski. The film stars Krasinski and Emily Blunt and revolves around a family who lives in silence in the woods, avoiding mysterious creatures that are hyper-sensitive to sound. The film is set to hit theatres on April 6th.

안녕하세요 오늘은 딸기 생크림 케이크를 준비했어요 
작년에는 그냥 생크림 케이크를 만들었는데 올해는 초코초코~

오늘은 먹는 소리가 없습니다 
1호 사이즈 케이크입니다 (무스링은 높은 1호)

▶재료 (15cm cake , 1호 케이크 1개 분량) 

+ 케이크 시트
계란 2개, 설탕 45g, 바닐라 익스트랙 3ml, 박력분 40g, 코코아가루 6g, 버터 10g

+ 초코 생크림
생크림 220ml, 설탕 20g, 초콜릿 100g

+ 케이크 안에 들어간 딸기 대략 14~16개 , 데코용 딸기 7~10개
+ 설탕 시럽 https://youtu.be/zBiOlSnTc8k 

1) 시트 - 노른자에 설탕(20g)과 바닐라를 넣고 서걱거림이 사라질 때 까지 섞어줍니다
2) 다른 볼에 흰자를 담아 휘핑합니다 (남은 설탕을 나눠 넣어 줍니다)
3) 머랭이 완성되면 노른자에 2번 나눠 넣어가며 섞어줍니다 
4) 박력분과 코코아가루를 체쳐 넣고 섞어줍니다 
5) 버터를 전자레인지에 돌려 녹여 반죽을 조금 덜어 버터와 섞어줍니다 
6) 다시 원래 볼에 부어 잘 섞어줍니다 
7) 준비한 틀에 부어 탕탕 쳐주고 예열된 오븐에 구워줍니다 (170도 20~23분)
8) 구운 시트는 식혀서 반으로 잘라주고 하나만 더 작게 잘라 둡니다 
9) 딸기 - 딸기14~16개 정도를 먼저 준비해줍니다 
10) 딸기를 반 정도만 반으로 잘라둡니다 
11) 크림 - 초콜릿을 녹여두고 다른 볼에 생크림과 설탕을 넣고 휘핑합니다 
12) 묽게 휘핑이 되었으면 녹인 초콜릿을 넣고 계속 휘핑합니다
13) 휘핑한 크림은 짤주머니에 담아줍니다 
14) 딸기, 시트, 설탕 시럽, 초콜릿 크림이 준비합니다
15) 1호 무스링에 무스띠를 넣고 시트 1장을 깔고 시럽을 발라줍니다
16) 크림을 바닥에 짜주고 반 자른 딸기를 둘러줍니다 (영상참고)
17) 가운데에도 나머지 딸기를 넣어주고 크림으로 덮어줍니다 
18) 조금 작게 잘라둔 시트를 올려 시럽을 바르고 남은 크림으로 덮어줍니다 
19) 윗면을 잘 정리한 다음 냉장실에 2시간 이상 굳혀 무스링을 분리합니다 
20) 남은 크림과 데코용으로 준비한 딸기로 데코합니다 

딸기와 초코 조합은 최고! 선물하기도 좋고 디저트로 딱이에요 
생일케이크로 준비하셔도 좋을 것 같습니다 :)

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다
시청해주셔서 감사합니다

Lyrics

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
""Come to me"" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs

Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

It all started in 2008, when Nick Fury told Tony Stark about the Avengers Initiative, and ten years after Iron Man hit theaters, Earth's mightiest heroes are set to face their toughest challenge: Thanos the Mad Titan. Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, Avengers: Infinity War will feature at least 76 characters, be Marvel's longest movie to date, and revolve around six mysterious stones. Well, seven if you count Deadpool's continuity gem. Which they won't. It's a lot to keep track of. So if you need a primer to prepare for history's biggest superhero movie, here's everything you need to know before seeing Avengers: Infinity War...

Being a CEO ain't easy, and trying to change the world into a place where creativity has value and can allow makers to thrive is one huge task. But I believe it can be done! And I believe it IS being done. By you!

I was so blown away by your video that you made for Casey, and the way it resonated in the real world with creators from all over, that I just had to make this video for you. While trying to summon the ""Conte mojo"", I stumbled upon something called the lightning effect in Premiere CC. God only knows where my life could have wound up if I didn't find this effect. So thank you Jack.

I'm not a part of Patreon at the moment (Just kidding, I have one now. Link below! 😜) because, well....yeah, that's 37 subscribers. But I hope, and plan, to make 2018 big year and am gonna have tons of fun along the way.

Keep being awesome. Keep CEO-ing. And keep ignoring the rules!

Sierra is obviously beautiful and talented, but her kindness makes her glow. When I heard the song that she wrote for Ryan, I knew it would be great in the film, but the surprise was the letter that she saved for him. 

Sierra’s song, “Make it Easy” was written by Sierra Black, Mark Bright and Chris Stevens. It's available on Apple Music and Spotify. other songs were  Promised Land by John Lucas & Cathedrals by John Lucas.

It's estimated that there are over 2 million rats in New York City alone. They often carry infectious diseases like E. Coli and Salmonella and gnaw on infrastructure, causing billions of dollars in damage every year. 

But is any of this the rat's fault? Rodentologist Bobby Corrigan says that rats can only succeed in the midst of human failure. If we were smarter mammals, better at disposing our trash and taking care of our infrastructure, then we wouldn't have to worry about rats in our cities.

So Join me as I travel through San Fransisco with my friends Shane & Ryland by my side, as I delve into the unknown & wildly mysterious world of applying makeup to my face with makeup legend Jeffree Star as my guide.

 Keep your eyes peeled for pro makeup tips and DIY hacks such as, but not limited to, ditching the expensive world of eyeshadows and instead opting to use Cheeto dust instead. I'm kidding of course. This turned out to be an actually very not-good idea and made my eyes feel badly. Would not recommend. But I had fun trying. Whatever. I love you. Enjoy this video.

The elusive final iteration of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket is finally almost here. Although we’ve known quite a bit about what’s going to be new with Block 5, the general public has had a very hard time understanding what, when, why, how, huh’s when it comes to block changes.

Well today, we’re going to try and untangle the confusion of block changes, revealing the history of the Falcon 9 and how its evolved into the fully and rapidly reusable rocket we hope to see with this new ultimate Block 5 Falcon 9.

We’re also going to do a side by side comparison of all versions of the Falcon 9 including Block 5 to show you just how much is changing before SpaceX commits to freezing the Falcon 9 so astronauts can finally ride on top.

And lastly we’re going to explain why SpaceX has been throwing away some of their older Falcon 9’s before they get into this new Block 5 booster.

El de Fuentealbilla se exhibió en Madrid para liderar un partido magnífico de los de Valverde

Andrés Iniesta levantó este sábado su título número 31 con el Barça. El capitán, autor del 0-4 en el minuto 50 tras un regate magistral a David Soria, realizó un partido para el recuerdo.

El '8' azulgrana lideró la exhibición de un conjunto que mostró todo su potencial para levantar la trigésima Copa del Rey de la historia del Club. Iniesta, que también envió un balón al larguero en la primera mitad, fue ovacionado por ambas aficiones en el minuto 88, cuando fue sustituido por Denis Suárez. El capitán se mostró visiblemente emocionado sentado en el banquillo, y después del partido, en zona mixta, anunció que hará pública la decisión sobre su futuro esta próxima semana.

No te pierdas el seguimiento especial al capitán azulgrana, uno de los jugadores más destacados del FC Barcelona en la goleada por 0-5 al Sevilla en la final de la Copa del Rey.

I'm not sure how alarmed to be about artificial intelligence. Personally I think it's really hard to predict when we'll create a machine that essentially has consciousness. That's because we don't know what consciousness is, how it works, what's required to create it etc. So It might be technologically around the corner or a hundred years away.

What I do think is more predictable is the development of autonomous weapons that use AI to be the most effective killing machines of all time. That is scary. As outline by people like Musk and Hawking, this threat is clear and present so we should address it. I would like to see us agree as a species not to develop these sorts of weapons because if any one state does develop them, they would be very hard to stop.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XAgXwUwQoPA/sddefault.jpg,0.0454001163672634,0.001967593795131277,23.073927392739268,0.005235228111006057,0.047367710162394674,0.052602938273400734,2018-04-02,14:00:01,Monday,0,5,19,5,18,24,174,0,43,1,1,3,0,2,0,4.0,8.0,['rr Pannier preg ww3'],"['rr', 'Pannier', 'preg', 'ww3']",True,"['rr', 'pannier', 'preg', 'ww3']",4,4,16,0,0,0,0,5.620201852321832,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBg-rdb2IWI/sddefault.jpg,0.01058204864433238,0.00013428387130809275,78.80357142857143,0.0007673364074748157,0.010716332515640472,0.01148366892311529,2018-04-19,08:35:02,Thursday,3,9,38,9,33,52,330,0,76,0,1,8,10,3,0,5.0,8.0,"['ea', '7', '', 'ea', '', 'CORDEN']","['ea', '7', 'ea', 'CORDEN']",True,"['ea', '7', 'ea', 'corden']",4,3,11,0,0,0,0,6.326905823014135,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

After 22 seasons at the Club and 16 years in the senior side - in which he played a total of 674 matches and scored 57 goals -, the Barça captain said goodbye to the Stadium and fans after Barça’s win against Real Sociedad (1-0).

Iniesta’s name was chanted throughout the game and the entire Stadium rose as one to acclaim him when he left the pitch for the last time. After the match, he was given a special tribute, which included his team-mates making a guard of honour whilst all wearing his No.8 shirt.

In the following video, we take a look at Iniesta’s final week at the Club from the inside. His last game, the trip to South Africa to play the friendly for the centenary of Nelson Mandela's birth, his last training session at the Ciutat Esportiva, the tribute on Friday at the Camp Nou with many special guests... All this and much more, in a video not to be missed!

At Japanese baths, you must be naked which is normal in Japan, but public bathing may be new some people. In Japan, there is an expression - hadaka no tsukiai (裸の付き合い) ""we're all equal when naked"" - so don't worry! We're here just to bathe and relax.

These bath houses called sento have evolved from their Showa era post war design to modern interiors that may surprise you. Some look like they're from sci-fi movies from the year 2050 and other have gone back in time to the 1920's Taisho era when everything was made out of wood and glass. The industry is under going big changes and there's never been a better time to experience Tokyo's sento culture than right now.

▶︎ For more information on Tokyo's sento, check tattoo friendly places or see the history of bathing in Japan, check out the ""Tokyo Sento Association"" official site http://www.1010.or.jp/english/

In this episode, we visit 5 Sento around Tokyo, some of them newly remodeled, some have not changed since constructed 80 years ago, all of the tattoo friendly!

HOW MUCH IS VISITING A SENTO?
▶︎ 460 yen ($4)
The entrance fee is universal through the city of Tokyo.
Sento are typically open from 16:00 to 22:00 daily.

People with body art will be happy to learn that Tokyo's Bath Houses are mostly tattoo friendly. With the Tokyo Olympics coming in 2020, Tokyo's sento are a snapshot of the cultural shifts happening in the city today.

Visiting the sento is good for your health, increasing blood circulation and finding total relaxation for the body.

A lot of people think you need to pay 900 to a thousand dollars for a good smartphone these days. And you know what? You don’t. 
For the past few weeks I've been using the Honor 7X, HTC U11 Life, and Motorola Moto X4, three midrange smartphones that bring a slew of special features not seen before in this price bracket – which runs from $200 to $400 unlocked. That's not the most affordable collection of smartphones can get, nor is this roundup at all exclusive – but at the top of 2018, I believe it to be the sweet spot between frugality and a solid Android experience. Join me for The Best Midrange Smartphones at the top of 2018!

Have you ever thought what would happen if you stopped ""wasting time"" on this process? 

You would surely have a lot of free time for learning something new, doing sports, working, or just hanging out with friends. Sounds cool? But let's have a look at the consequences of never sleeping again.
After one day without sleep, you’ll feel better than ever. The reason for these strange feelings lies in the fact that your brain increases dopamine levels trying to compensate your lack of sleep. However, closer to the end of the day, this happy mood is evaporating.    It's strictly ""not recommended"" to drive in such a state, as it may turn extremely dangerous when you're sleep deprived. 
After two days without sleep your body will have less and less energy, and you will begin to look pale and a bit ill. What is even worse, your immune system will start to let you down becoming less efficient. Your judgment will get impaired.
What is more, the effects of the absence of sleep will be getting worse and worse, and after a short time, the body will begin to shut down. This means that after three sleepless days you'll be unable to function or communicate normally.  
If you manage to fall asleep on the 11th day, shockingly, there won't be any long-term health effects. This means that after a good and quality sleep lasting about 12 hours, you will be perfectly fine. This doesn't refer to those people who suffer from fatal familial insomnia. Such patients can survive maximum for a year, and a half granted their condition was worsening gradually, and they still managed to sleep from time to time for the first several months of the disease.

SUMMARY
-This may seem weird, but after 24 hours without sleep, you'll start to feel happy and elated.
-As soon as the second day without sleep starts, you will have some important physical functions getting shut by your body. For example, its ability to metabolize glucose will be lost.
-You will start to hallucinate after three days with no sleep, and your body will be desperately trying to rationalize the feelings it's experiencing. 
-The maximum recorded time without sleep was approximately 264 hours, that's about 11 days. After that, the body shuts down completely which leads to death.
-Figure out your favorite sleeping position. Before going to bed, enjoy a nice warm shower or a bath with eucalyptus or lavender bath salt. Sleep in the nude. Start to control the light you're exposed to a couple of hours before you go to bed and add some gentle sounds. Don't eat before going to bed.

오늘은 역사상 최초 가나 출신 올림픽 스켈레톤 선수 아콰지 프림퐁씨와 촬영을 할 영광이 있었어요! 바로 한국의 아이언맨 윤성빈씨와도 함께 경기에 출전했던 분이시죠.

13년 동안 불법체류자로 살았던 스토리부터 올림픽에 출전하게된 감동 스토리까지, 프림퐁씨의 엄청난 인생이야기를 들어봅니다. 그리고 당연히 한국음식이 빠질 수 없죠! 이번에는 제가 가장 좋아하는 한국 피자... 그 중 하나랑은 아콰지씨가 사랑에 빠져버렸답니다 😂

이번 영상도 재밌게 봐주셨음 좋겠네요!

가나의 봅슬레이 및 스켈레톤 연맹은 발전하는데 아직 많은 도움이 필요하고 여러분들도 도와주실 수 있어요! 기부하시려면 www.bsfghana.com을 방문해주세요. 감사합니다!!

Today we had the privilege to film with Akwasi Frimpong, the FIRST Olympic Skeleton athlete from Ghana, and a competitor of the Korean Ironman, Yun Sungbin.

We hear about his incredible life, 13 years as an illegal immigrant, and his inspiring story that has brought him here to the Olympics. And of course we try some amazing Korean food - this time my favourite Korean pizzas… One of which Akwasi falls in love with 😂

Enjoy!

The Bobed and Skeleton federation in Ghana could still use help in developing and you guys can help! To donate please go to www.bsfghana.com. Thank you all!!

12:00 President Trump insisted today that reports that he attempted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last June were “fake news.”

14:20  In the first in a short series on European populism, VICE News tracks the build up to the Czech Republic's presidential elections, their ongoing spat with the EU, and the increasing polarization of Eastern and Western Europe.
