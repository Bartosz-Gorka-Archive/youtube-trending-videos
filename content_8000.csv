Spielberg is one of the most celebrated directors of our time. From 1975‚Äôs ‚ÄòJaws‚Äô which started the summer blockbuster phenomenon to 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Post‚Äô, Spielberg has moved audiences with his emotional stories, thrilled them with his incredible action sequences, made them think with his political dramas and inspired them to explore a world beyond our own. Along the way, he has won three Academy Awards with two coming in the Best Director Category for Schindler‚Äôs List and Saving Private Ryan and one in the Best Picture Category for ‚ÄòSchindler‚Äôs List‚Äô. Each video in this series will chronicle one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current movie climate.

Panelists in Collider‚Äôs Top 10 Steven Spielberg Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Dennis Tzeng, Mark Reilly, John Rocha, Thadd Williams, Clarke Wolfe and many, many more.

The Mavic Air is no exception. Its extreme portability, its dashing good looks. BUT what is the point of all that if it doesnt fly well? Thats what we are here to find out. And my first adventure with the DJI Mavic Air did not go so well. Everything was updated, Beginner mode turned off, Flight limits set to maximum.... and nothing. It would not fly farther than 160 feet. (60 meters) Not good.

Luckily... I tested the drone out a few days later... and everything started working again. You'll have to see the video.

Hopefully this helped one of you. Here is the current pricing on the Mavic Air: http://amzn.to/2CjP9YM

Ill keep playing around with the Mavic Air, But in the meantime check out Dan's channel where we destroyed a car! https://youtu.be/MTafF2X32Js (And of course he used the footage from our flight around the windmills.)

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle gave their first interview together Monday (27 NOV. 2017), and, after the questions had stopped, the cameras kept rolling, capturing a few moments of the couple joking together.
During the candid interview, the Prince and his new fiancee explained how they first met on a blind date, fell in love in Botswana and got engaged at their cottage in Kensington Palace on a ""cozy night.""
The couple will marry at Windsor Castle next May, according to Kensington Palace officials.
Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, and American actress Markle have been dating for about a year and a half.

Her life has changed completely. In a new instalment of the Histories programme, Bar√ßa TV interviewed the No.22 over a whole day.

Lyrics:

VERSE 1

They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me no,
It‚Äôs cool but I don‚Äôt see them laughing at my money though
They spittin facts at me, I‚Äôm spittin tracks, catch me?
I‚Äôm spinning gold out my records know you can‚Äôt combat me
They tell me jesus walks, I tell them money talks.
Bling got me chill, cause I‚Äôm living in an ice box.
They tell me I've been sleepin, I say I‚Äôm wide awake
Tracks hot and ready so they call me mister e-z bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin with a drank on an empty tank to the bank

PRE CHORUS

Do you feel me? Talk a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feel the same

That‚Äôs the real me. Pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me and I‚Äôm laughin at the pain

CHORUS

Stayin still, Eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by

Pain pills, Nice clothes
If I fall I think I‚Äôll fly

Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design

None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time


VERSE 2

They tell me that I‚Äôm special, I smile and shake my head
I‚Äôll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I‚Äôm so humble, I say I‚Äôm turning red
They let me lie to them and don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôve been misled
They give so much to me, I‚Äôm losing touch get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds they just let me.
They tell me I‚Äôm a god, I‚Äôm lost in the facade
Six feet off the ground at all times I think I‚Äôm feelin odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin so much bread, I don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre just being fake
They tell me they‚Äôre below me, I act like I‚Äôm above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love

PRE CHORUS

Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable you‚Äôre unable to touch

Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think and I don‚Äôt do pain

CHORUS 


Stayin still, Eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by

Pain pills, Nice clothes
If I fall I think I‚Äôll fly

Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design

None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time

CHORUS 2

Lay still, Restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind

All thrill, No stress
All my muses left behind

World is, below
So high up, I‚Äôm near divine

Lean in, Let go
I feel fear for the very last time",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Zj0JOHJR-s/sddefault.jpg,0.010081559842748321,0.0004890002500959299,20.616676250718807,0.0011689889820004605,0.010570560092844248,0.011739549074844707,2017-11-23,17:39:32,Thursday,3,5,43,5,29,37,358,1,46,0,0,5,31,1,0,7.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.647752902335543,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

While you still control it primarily with your voice, the touchscreen lends much more versatility to the notion of a home assistant: you can check on the Nest Camera monitoring your baby room, start a Duo call with your Pixel-toting friends, or stream the latest video from your favorite YouTuber (ahem). Yes, those are all blatantly transparent house ads for Google's own products, but more importantly they're things that are difficult or impossible to do on the Smart Display's principal competition, Amazon's Echo Show.

The Lenovo Smart Display with Google Assistant will come in 8"" and 10"" sizes when it debuts this summer, with prices starting at $199 and topping out at $249. Check out the MrMobile hands-on and *Android Central‚Äôs own take,* and let me know in the comments if you'd like to see my traditionally mobile-only coverage fleshed out with a Lenovo Smart Display review later in the year!

Yanny or Laurel what do you hear clearly? 
In this video i will explain why some peoples hear Yanny and some others Hear Laurel , there are a lot of tham who hear both names in the same time!  im one of tham i can hear both! 
what about you? Do You Hear ""Yanny"" or do you hear ""Laurel""? leave the comment below!
------------------
Explaining:
-------------------
‚ÄúYanny‚Äù or ‚ÄúLaurel‚Äù the audio clip that‚Äôs tearing the internet apart here is the full article explainied and and you can share it with others:
https://tips2fix.com/yanny-or-laurel-what-do-you-hear-tech-clip-explained
--------------------
""Yanny or Laurel""
Why some peoples hear Yanny and other Hear Laurel ?
So what‚Äôs going on here? The clip is playing around with frequency ‚Äî and it depends on the range of frequencies listeners hear.

Example with clip.
----------------------------
1. Audio quality is the first evidence .
Here we hear an audio from device from phone or something , as we see the audio is very damaged , low frequency  cuted , and  , so now what do we have here.

So we don‚Äôt have the full band frequency and its easy for ear and brain to misunderstand the right world sayedin the clip.

Example Clip with my voice and showing the graphic

Difference between mp3 and wav
----------------------------------
Yanny and Laurel Frequency:
Humans typically pay attention to three different frequencies when they‚Äôre listening to speech. The lowest of the three frequencies is ‚Äúabsolutely essential‚Äù for the L‚Äôs and R‚Äôs ‚Äî the consonants that make up ‚ÄúLaurel.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo when you‚Äôre listening to ‚ÄòLaurel,‚Äô the reason you get L, R, and L is because of the movement of that third frequency,‚Äù he said.
Here‚Äôs the catch. The word ‚ÄúYanny,‚Äù the second frequency, has almost exactly the same pattern as the L, R, L in ‚ÄúLaurel,‚Äù he added.
One reason for the confusion is the poor quality of the recording. ‚ÄúTypically, if you have a high-quality recording and you‚Äôre listening on a good device of some sort, you‚Äôre not ever going to be confused by those,‚Äù Story said.
So if you‚Äôre hearing ‚ÄúLaurel,‚Äù you‚Äôre likely picking up on the lower frequency. If you hear ‚ÄúYanny,‚Äù you‚Äôre picking up on the higher frequency.
‚Äúthis is a really cool auditory illusion.‚Äù

Why do I hear more one than another.
Inside your ears are small sensors called air cells. They pick up on sound waves and send them to the brain ‚ÄúIf you lose all your air cells you can‚Äôt hear.‚Äù Noise exposure can damage these hair cells, and they don‚Äôt grow back.

So now younger ears heard yanny. because have a lot of this sensors and thay are able to chatch all band of frequency especialy higer frequency


Most of us are used to hearing more mid-range frequencies, which could make it even trickier to tell if it‚Äôs Laurel or Yanny.

9 . How Match do I have to worry?

From 100 %  You have to worry just 10 %.

This kind of test is exaggerated because its not in the full band of frequency.

In this case, Brain its confused, because frequency are not 100 % pure, not clear.

Frequency are mixed and dirty, and this is not normal .

And the voice now transformed from human voice, to the voice like mine , computer voice, with not all frequency band.

What to do?   Conclusions and Suggestions.

We leave in  cities and countries where the noise are to loud, and our life is very fast, as you know, to have fun and to feel good, young people‚Äôs are join party and pubs, they hear music with very loud volume.

All speakers generate frequency, better once are depended in price.

Also the same thing with headphones you use; be careful don‚Äôt buy cheap headphones, see only professional brands. Stay away from WiFi headphones.Stay away talking very long in phone use professional headphones only with wire. Don‚Äôt stay long. Stay out of stress , go and relax yourselfe in quite places.

so in this case you have to carry on our ear cells.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

DINOSAURS DON'T SHOW AGE! REX EXPLAINED | Jurassic World: Evolution Discussion 

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

Subscribe to our channel: https://goo.gl/wMuSDD

Are you a fan of Black Panther? If the answer is yes, great, you‚Äôre going to love this video. If you‚Äôre a die hard Marvel fan or even familiar with comic books, then you‚Äôve known about Black Panther way before he appeared in Civil War. If the the answer is no, oh who are we kidding, who isn‚Äôt excited about the Wakandan hero‚Äôs solo film? 
If all you know about T‚ÄôChalla is what you‚Äôve seen on screen, then you‚Äôre in for a treat. The Black Panther is one of the most important heroes in Marvel‚Äôs roster, unfortunately he wasn‚Äôt too well known to mainstream audiences. That‚Äôs all changing now, and we hope you enjoy this ride, because we are going to share some lesser known facts that Marvel hasn‚Äôt made too prevalent. 
Did you know that he and Storm were married? That‚Äôs right Storm of the X Men comic books. They were also one of Marvel‚Äôs most beloved couples of all time. 
Black Panther also went through a brief name change because of the Black Panther Party. He briefly went by Black Leopard. He was also temporarily replaced by White Tiger, a biracial white cop who took the place of Black Panther.

A common expression has us believing that imitation is the highest form of flattery. However, poorly produced films and publicity stunts to sell more movies might end up in a lawsuit or an embarrassing Disney rip off mockbuster! Today, we‚Äôll look at 10 animated movies that copied Disney. Disney has and continues to set the standard high when it comes to producing high-quality, engaging animated movies. 

Movies like ‚ÄúLady and The Tramp‚Äù and ‚ÄúBambi‚Äù feature scenes that have become movie tropes. Meanwhile, the success of movies like ‚ÄúFrozen,‚Äù ‚ÄúCars,‚Äù ‚ÄúToy Story,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFinding Dory‚Äù are used as a means to sell a knock off! Even ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúMulan,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Hunchback of Notre Dame‚Äù have been turned into lesser copies of themselves. Our number one Netflix rip off of ‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù has even caused a stir online. Have you ever seen an animated movie that was a Disney copy? Let us know what we missed in the comments!

German generals targeted two land-owning ethnic groups, the Herero and Nama, killing 100,000 people; and throwing the survivors into concentration camps.

The killings shrunk the Herero and Nama from among the biggest groups in the country to two of the smallest. Partly as a result, the Herero and Nama are much poorer than Namibians of German descent.

Now, descendants of the survivors are suing Germany for an admittance of genocide, an apology, and reparations.

""We hope to get an apology from the Germans,"" Gottlieb Kazombiaze, an Herero activist told VICE News.

They also want to use the money to buy back their land. But they‚Äôre facing fierce resistance from the country‚Äôs white population. White Namibians comprise 6 percent of the country's population, but own 60 percent of its private land. They‚Äôre not happy with the prospect of giving up property that's been in their families for decades.

If the Herero and Nama win, the case could set a legal precedent and encourage other indigenous groups to sue former colonial powers.

Diddy', 'Drake', 'Rap music', 'Under Armour', 'Lebron 9 Galaxys', 'Snapchat', 'Social Media', ""Boomin'"", 'Entrepreneur']",2835417.0,24045.0,1441.0,940.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ggM2hVwy0Y/default.jpg,"Benjamin Kickz, an 18-year-old entrepreneur who sells incredibly rare sneakers to celebrities, sat down with Business Insider to discuss how he does it all. The following is a transcript of the video.

Benjamin Kickz: My name is Benjamin Kickz and I'm 18 years old and I get sneakers for a lot of celebrities and also sell them on my website to the public.

I got into sneakers at 13, so like, 5 years ago, but I really started selling them heavy at 15. Basically what made me get into buying and selling shoes was because my mom bought me this one shoe, the LeBron 9 Galaxys, and everyone was like ‚Äúoh this is the wave.‚Äù I just felt like I had the sauce, so I just started buying shoes.

The first sneakers I ever bought was either the Galaxy Foams or the Milo 7s. And then my dad was like ‚Äúoh, you must be crazy, you're out of your mind.‚Äù And then I sold them for $1,000. He was like ‚Äúoh, so you found someone just as dumb as you.‚Äù

Basically, I started off with DJ Khaled cause he was the first celebrity that I sold sneakers to. Then he introduced me to a bunch of other people like P. Diddy and French Montana and all of them.

Before he had a Snapchat, we would just hang out all the time and do stuff. Then he made a Snapchat which obviously went viral I'm pretty sure we all know.

And then from there, he just started posting Snapchats of stuff we always use to do. And people used to think it was funny and not normal but it was regular stuff we did.So he put me on through Snapchat basically and then just helped my business. How's business, you know, it's boomin'.

A lot of my clients are in the music industry but I guess it's because I was always into hip-hop as a kid, like, that's all I listened to. After DJ Khaled, he introduced me to a bunch of other artists, so I guess it just went from there. Athletes too but I'm not into sports as much I'm into hip-hop.¬†Some of my favorite artists are like Migos, Drake, Future, Lil Wayne, obviously.

Manny: What is it like to hang and party with Drake?

Benjamin: I mean, I don't think he's like how he is in his music because I've never been with him when he's in his feelings, so I don't know. But like ‚Ä¶ he's cool, he's mad cool.

Manny: So out of all those artists who are your biggest customers?

Benjamin: Probably P. Diddy. Like, he just buys like, phew. Yeah, very, very bulk.

Manny: Tell me about what you think about the Under Armour shoes.

I think the Under Armour shoes are amazing, I love them. I got a pair for myself, personally. The Steph Curry ones. I think the Big Baller Brand shoes, I think they're dope. Everyone's saying they're too expensive for like $500 retail price. Personally, I think it's a little high, but the shoe's dope and obviously they're some of the best players out right now so, you know, do your thing.

Manny: They're getting a lot of props for just taking their own lane and making their own shoe. Is that something you could see yourself getting into?

Benjamin: Yeah, most definitely. I mean, I wouldn't mind a contract depending on like, who it would be, but I would definitely do my own shoe also. I have some things in the making, but I don't know, we have to put it all together, you know?

Manny: What's your merch? What's your brand?

Benjamin: Oh, Boomin'. This.

Manny: How's that doing?

Benjamin: Boomin'.

Whether you call it a Caveman, Cowboy, or Tomahawk; this ribeye steak is the King. Weighing in at well over 3lbs, it‚Äôs one ‚ÄúHoss‚Äù of a steak.  

If you‚Äôre going to shell out the money for a prime cut like this you want to be sure to know how to cook it right.  

For this recipe I fire up my PK 360 (check out this grill here: https://www.pkgrills.com/the-new-pk360-grill-smoker/?afmc=1s )  set up for a 2 zone fire ‚Äì hot side and cool side; I also add a set of GrillGrates (check them out here: https://www.grillgrate.com/?aff=13 ) for even cooking temps and perfect grill marks.  

Season the steak with a good dose of Salt, Black Pepper, and Garlic; I use my AP Rub but you can use your favorite seasonings.  Let it hang out at room temperature for a half hour so the seasonings can start working into the meat.  

After 30 minutes apply a light coat of coarse Steak Rub and sear it on the hot side of the grill about 5 minutes each side.  Be sure to give it a twist half way through each side so the steak develops grill marks.  

Carefully take the tomahawk off the grill (use a good set of grill gloves) and place it on a raised rack over the cool side of the grill. At this point you want to monitor the internal temperature. Insert a probe thermometer (I used my Thermoworks Chef Alarm 
 - check it out here: https://www.thermoworks.com/ChefAlarm?tw=KILLERHOGS ) into the center of the steak set for 125‚Å∞ or your desired doneness.

Place a shallow aluminum pan under the steak and add a stick of butter, fresh sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and ¬º cup olive oil.  As the steak cooks, baste it every few minutes with the butter mixture.  

Once it hits desired internal temperature‚Ä¶I like it medium rare‚Ä¶remove it from the grill and rest for at least 10 minutes.  

A steak like this is great served right on the cutting board.  Cut the bone off and simply slice it into desired pieces against the grain.  And don‚Äôt forget to gnaw on that bone‚Ä¶That‚Äôs where the best flavor is!!

I expected the hardwood to be faster than the felt because the rotational moment of inertia when spinning around the center is 1/4th that of tipping on the edge.  I was wrong in this case, but I'm wondering if this would hold true on glass?

""Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resigned Wednesday, a day after Politico reported Fitzgerald's purchase of tobacco stock after she took the position at the nation's top public health agency.
Such an investment is obviously at odds with the mission of the CDC, considering cigarette smoking will result in the deaths of nearly half a million Americans this year. Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

The CDC's slogan is ""24/7: Saving Lives, Protecting People."" But Fitzgerald bet against that mission just one month into her tenure at the agency, when she purchased stock in a tobacco company -- one of the very drugs she is supposed to be leading the crusade against.

The news of her stock purchases was first reported Tuesday. According to that report, Fitzgerald ""bought tens of thousands of dollars in new stock holdings in at least a dozen companies,"" including Japan Tobacco, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world. It sells four brands in the US: Export ""A,"" LD, Wave and Wings.

The day after the purchase, Fitzgerald ""toured the CDC's Tobacco Laboratory, which researches how the chemicals in tobacco harm human health,"" according to Politico.‚Äù*

If the first Pacific Rim made us all feel like giddy fifth graders, Pacific Rim: Uprising makes us feel like giddy fifth graders just wrote the movie. Steven S. DeKnight's sequel plays like a $150 million after-school cartoon ‚Äî a city-leveling monster mash with Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. And there's no world in which that's a truly bad thing.  Of course, the humans win the day, fighting back the Kaiju threat by learning the value of teamwork. Even Ms. Shao sets aside her corporate greed to assist the Jaeger pilots with their mission to stop the Kaiju assault on Mt. Fuji. But was it all so clear-cut?  Let's clear up those pesky little details that you may have missed in the final act. Here's the ending of Pacific Rim: Uprising explained. Spoilers ahead, of course‚Ä¶

This train trestle is about 100 years old. At the time when it was built, there were no standards for minimum clearance.

How often do trucks crash into the bridge?
On average, about once a month a truck gets visibly damaged at the bridge. However, every day I see trucks that trip the overheight warning lights, stop and turn into the side street.

Why don‚Äôt they fix it?
Depends on who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are and on what ‚Äúfix‚Äù means. The North Carolina Railroad Company owns the train trestle, and their concern is primarily with keeping the trains running and keeping them running safely. So their concern is mainly with reducing the impact of the truck crashes on the actual structure of the train trestle. As far as they are concerned, they solved that problem by installing the crash beam.
The city of Durham has installed ‚Äúlow clearance‚Äù signs on each of the 3 blocks leading up to the trestle (Gregson is a one-way road). There is an ‚Äúoverheight when flashing‚Äù sign with flashing lights that are triggered by vehicles that are too tall. Several blocks ahead of the trestle the speed limit is 25 MPH. The folks from the city planning department said that they made an effort to prevent accidents.
The North Carolina Dept. of Transportation maintains the road, but not the signage. I suspect they have much bigger problems to deal with statewide than this bridge.

Is the clearance signage accurate?
The clearance signage displays  a maximum safe clearance ‚Äì and yes, in that sense it is accurate. The actual clearance of the crash beam right in front of the trestle is 11 feet 10.8 inches, which gives it a 2.8 inch safety margin. The MUTCD allows for a maximum of 3 inches difference between the signage and the actual clearance.

Metric, please!
Would this situation be better if the signage were metric? Well ‚Ä¶ take a look at his website: 2m40.com (Warning: French. Metric)

For the convenience of our metric-only audience, here are the measurements we‚Äôre talking about in meters:
11foot8 (11 feet 8 inches) = 3.556 meters
11 feet 10.8 inches = 3.627 meters
Safety margin: 7.1 cm (at the crest of the road)

Can‚Äôt the road be lowered?
That would be prohibitively expensive because a sewer main runs just a few feet below the road bed. That sewer main also dates back about a hundred years and, again, at the time there were no real standards for minimum clearance for railroad underpasses.

Can‚Äôt the bridge be raised?
Here, too, the question is who would want to pay the millions of dollars to raise the tracks a couple of feet? To accomplish this, the grade of the tracks would have to changed on both sides of the trestle, probably for several miles. That would require rebuilding all trestles in Durham. And NS would have to shut down this busy track for months. I don‚Äôt think they are interested in that idea.

Is the signeage inadequate?
The signeage is pretty good. Large signs alert driver to the low clearance several blocks before the bridge. Overheight vehicles trip a light switch that turns on flashing warning lights.right at the bridge.

Should there be more signeage?
It‚Äôs hard to see how more ‚Äúlow-clearance‚Äù signs will significantly improve the situation. But maybe a different kind of signeage would get the driver‚Äôs attention.

Could they install a low-clearance bar?
A low clearance bar is a bar suspended by chains ahead of the bridge. Overheight vehicles hit that bar first and the noise alerts the driver to to the problem. I understand that this approach has been successful in other places, but it‚Äôs not practical here. There are many overheight trucks that have to be able to drive right up to the bridge and turn onto Peabody St. in order to deliver supplies to several restaurants. Making Peabody St inaccessible from Gregson St would make the restaurant owners and the delivery drivers very unhappy.

Why are they using yellow flashing lights?
Warning lights have to be yellow according to the NC traffic laws.

Are the drivers stupid?
No idea. They certainly seem distracted and the rental truck drivers are also probably inexperienced.

Will insurance cover the damages?
Most truck rental insurance policies specifically exclude overhead damage from coverage. However, a good auto insurance or liability insurance might pick up the tab. Check with your agent. Or even better ‚Äì don‚Äôt hit the bridge!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9k319Qfm01A/sddefault.jpg,0.005703385220098979,0.00038360971315293084,14.867676767676768,0.002918146211873457,0.00608699493325191,0.009005141145125366,2018-01-20,10:12:11,Saturday,5,6,12,6,12,34,110,0,37,0,0,5,0,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.408291518106072,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'traffic light': 3, 'truck': 1}",4

We are excited to start the series with a true legend of photography. In a career spanning 50 years, award-winning photographer Joel Meyerowitz has featured in over 350 exhibitions and has published more than 25 photography books. His first book Cape Light is widely regarded as classic of the genre.

Joel is an extraordinary teacher and his passion his infectious. He will show you how to look for ideas and stories in a scene, improve your composition skills and use light and colour to capture a narrative. You‚Äôll even learn how to be invisible in the streets!

This course, however, is about so much more than photography. Joel will inspire you with his lust for life and poetry. He push to evolve and grow, to take a new look at the world around you and how to keep in touch with your sensibility and curiosity, how to create art with your photography.
So join us and let Joel show you how to see beauty, quirkiness and uniqueness, in everyday life.

Cardi B is one of the many A-listers performing at Coachella among The Weeknd, Haim, Sza, Eminem, and of course Yonce. But because Cardi signed her deal with Coachella sixth months ago, she revealed in an interview with SiriusXM‚Äôs Shade 45 that she is being paid $70,000 per weeknd, but dropping $300,000 on stage and productions costs. If you do the math, she‚Äôs being paid 140,000 total but because she‚Äôs dropping 300,000, she‚Äôs losing 160,000. If you‚Äôre wondering how Coachella got away with paying Cardi 70,000, think back to six months ago when she signed and where she was in her career. Bodak Yellow was still climbing the charts and she hadn‚Äôt yet racked in those album sales, award noms, and high demand numbers. But look at her now! With the clout she has now she really should be a headliner with a much larger payout. So personally I‚Äôm pissed, but Cardi actually has a really good attitude about it. Check out what she said in the interview.
She‚Äôs thinking of it as an investment which is admirable because it shows how much she values her brand and wanting to put on a good show for her fans. No doubt she is going to kill it and in the future will get that those paychecks she deserves. What do you guys think about Cardi‚Äôs Coachella paycheck vs. what she‚Äôs spending? Sound off in the comment section below and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching, I‚Äôm your host Drew Dorsey and I‚Äôll see you next time.

If you're new here, my name is Andrew Huang and I'm a musician who works with many genres and many instruments - and I've also made music with many things that aren't instruments like balloons, pants, water, and dentist equipment. For more info visit my website: http://andrewhuang.com

You can also stream and download my 40+ albums and EPs at http://andrewhuang.bandcamp.com or check out my other videos at http://youtube.com/andrewhuang

I never got into baking as much as everyone else seemed to but Kim & heaps of other makeup lovers swear by it & we can all agree Kims makeup and style is gorjie, so I wanted to test it.

From what I understood, the idea behind her kit is to make it easy for us plebs to get her signature BRIGHT under eye look, when I first saw the shades I was like WTF is this sh!t?! where are the 'deep-dark' colours? then i saw her video demo-ing it on the model and the aim is about getting the bright under-eye look... so i suppose thats why the deepest shade doest look deep, it's not meant to match, its meant to be lighter? I personally still think she should do some more undertones for the deeper shades - at least another 4 - since the ‚Äòlight‚Äô shades have heaps of tonal variation but the deep dark ones don‚Äôt. I wish I said this in the video - sorry :( Hopefully she releases more shades for the 'deep-dark' range. What are your thoughts?

Her demo video using shade 16: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfJ3wYR16uI

MY VLOG SERIES - A SNEAK PEAK INTO HOLLYWOOD AND BEHIND THE SCENES:
I also have a VLOG series where I take you behind the scenes from when I meet with Hollywood stars at different interview locations and give you a little sneak peak of what it's like to interview some of Hollywoods biggest stars. In my VLOGS I also take you to premieres, Hollywood parties, premiere after-parties, red carpets, The Oscars, The Golden Globes - and travels to film festivals, like Toronto, Cannes and Venice, comic-con in San Diego, as well as the typical film junket. I share some of my favorite interview tricks, some amazing, funny moments, but also some of my bloopers and less proud or awkward moments. So please come along for the ride behind the scenes in Hollywood, and don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions or leave comments in the description section. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

This video is full of tips & tricks for applying false lash strips!! In this video i'm sharing with you THE EASIEST way to apply falsies!! Also, glue that I use as well as all of the other tools you'll need to make sure your lashes stay put ALL DAY!! Weather you're a beginner or a pro, I have no doubt you'll find this video helpful!! i share two lash types & methods of application. The clear band is incredibly flexible & it's clear, so if you don't get the perfect application you won't notice it as much as you would with a thick lash band. They are also super light in weight, and much easier for your eyes comfort vs. the thicker band lash strip.
Thanks so much for watching & remember to practice till your a pro!! Don't forget to like, share, comment & Subscribe!! xoxo

1) ‚ÄòAvengers: Infinity War‚Äô Opening Scene Makes Thanos the Biggest and Baddest Villain in the MCU

2) Cult Hit 'The Room' Set for Wide Theatrical Release

3) Opening This Week ‚Äì Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, The Greatest Showman

4) Andy Serkis‚Äô ‚ÄòJungle Book‚Äô Movie Gets New Title ‚ÄòMowgli & First Synopsis

5) New Poster released for Wes Anderson‚Äôs ‚ÄòIsle of Dogs‚Äô

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

With the new year fast approaching, once 2018 ticks over we‚Äôll be only five short months from seeing Avengers Infinity War. Kevin Feige knows how fans have been wanting to see Thanos finally realized onscreen ever since he was introduced in the original The Avengers. Speaking at the recent Comic Con Experience in Brazil, (via a report from CBR), the longtime Marvel producer seemed aware of the fan concern for the character and his extensive build-up to Infinity War, assuring everyone, we‚Äôll not be disappointed.

According to THR, the film regarded as the ‚Äúworst movie ever made‚Äù will finally get a wide, theatrical release. The Room, which debuted in just two theatres in Los Angeles 14 years ago, will officially play for one day in 600 theatres this January 10th. The film, which is the inspiration for the James Franco directed The Disaster Artist, was financed, produced, written and directed by Tommy Wiseau, and centers on a man named Johnny (Wiseau) and his best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), and a love triangle with Johnny's future wife, Lisa.

OPENING THIS WEEK

BUY OR SELL

After months of wondering where Andy Serkis‚Äô Jungle Book movie adaptation was, Warner Bros. has finally unveiled a new title and synopsis for the film. Previously titled Jungle Book: Origins, the film has been retitled Mowgli along with the reveal of the first synopsis.

Fox Searchlight Pictures has released the new poster for Wes Anderson‚Äôs stop-motion feature, Isle of Dogs. The movie marks director Anderson‚Äôs second animated film, following the Academy Award-nominated Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009. Isle of Dogs tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, a 12-year-old caring for the corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island.

This event is clearly goes down as one of the most insanely unusual events in spaceflight history and has raised a TON of questions. Some about the physics, and other‚Äôs about its authenticity in general.

Well today we‚Äôre going to figure out what happens to a car if it‚Äôs put in the punishing environment of space.

I mean, come on, plastic in space? Tires in space? Paint in space?! How much of this is real and how much of this is simply impossible?

And lastly, say there is truly a midnight cherry red Tesla in outer space, where is it now, can we see it, and what‚Äôs going to happen to it in the future?

The Nike Kyrie 4 is the newest shoe for Kyrie Irving. The model features updated cushioning with Zoom in the heel and a more advanced outsole to provide him with better grip. Littered with tons of personal details, this might be Kyrie's most personal and performance oriented sneaker to date.

Description:


Did Kylie reveal her pregnancy on the Kardashian Christmas special? The mid season finale holds a lot of clues that we think are a definite confirmation! But where was Travis Scott? Kylie's baby daddy doesn't seem to be in the picture.. so what's the deal?! plus, are there more clues in the Kardashian Christmas card?

Mad Max: Fury Road is often praised for its visual storytelling, an achievement that was made possible by the film‚Äôs unique storyboarding/writing process. But what if you tried to write a screenplay for a movie that is primarily told through visual language? I try to do that in this video, and in the process, figure out what should and should not go in a script, as well as why I think more filmmakers should attempt to emulate Fury Road‚Äôs creative process.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyonc√© of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically, I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Giant Cupcake Pinata,  I started with 14lbs of my Ultimate Chocolate Cake, and 16lbs of my Ultimate Vanilla Cake dyed a party-ready yellow and teal tie-dye. A cherry red cake tops it all off getting filled with a super special surprise, and covered in fringed fondant! To follow all the details go to the full recipe -   http://bit.ly/CupcakePinataCakeRecipe

The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober‚Äôs iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views. His videos focus on creative ideas and science- and engineering-based pranks and activities. Rober is a regular guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"". Today, he does research and development work for a large technology company in Northern California, where he lives with his wife and son. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario worked together on the set of baywatch and they have definitely come out of that project a lot closer.. And most likely more than friends. The reason people are shpping them so hard is because Zac left a pretty flirty comment on Daddario‚Äôs instagram post of her glammed up for the Rampage Red carpet premiere, the photo is of her and her dog Levon sharing a cute moment. And zac seized the opportunity to comment ‚Äútwo hot bitches‚Äù with a whole bunch of emoji‚Äôs. Which predictably sent fans into a frenzie with folks replying to his comment ‚ÄúOMG I SHIIIP‚Äù ‚ÄúYES THE PERFECT COUPLE‚Äù and more.

Buuuut Alexandra didn‚Äôt comment back.. Uh oh. But that‚Äôs not the end for these two, because over on Zac‚Äôs instagram, he posted a photo of himself with his adorable new dog he saved from a kill shelter: MACA, and that definitely got her attention. Alexandra commented ‚Äúangel dog‚Äù and Zac wasn‚Äôt gonna let her get away so he replied ‚Äúdoggie date?‚Äù

Lo and behold, last week, they had their doggie date, and it was pretty dang adorable. Their cute comments to each other have been getting increasingly more public since the relationship rumors were first ignited in 2017. A source told People last week that they have been seeing each other, but it‚Äôs been on and off since working together on Baywatch. Well hopefully Zac keeps pursuing her, because that‚Äôs probably the most attractive couple i can possibly think of.

So what do you guys think? Is this thing going to be official? Or are their lives just too crazy for that sort of thing? Let me know in the comment section down below and when you‚Äôre done with that be sure to subscribe to clevver news for more fresh updates. I‚Äôm tom plumley but before i go, did you know shawn mendes and hailey baldwin are officially official? It‚Äôs true, get all the details by clicking right over here and as always, thanks for watching.

The pair had previously exchanged insults and threats. The breakthrough came after landmark talks between North and South Korea.
Mr Trump's announcement came hours after he welcomed home three American detainees released by North Korea.
Their release came during a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim.

As many of you know, I don't really repeat projects. ¬†Not that each project or video is perfect, far from it actually, I just rarely have the time or desire to completely reinvent something I've already done. If you check out the link for my first project video, you'l see why this project (being far from perfect) is in need of a revamping.

In my previous attempt at making a vacuum former, I placed the material in a frame and placed it in my oven to soften the plastic. This technically did work, but presented a lot of problems; melting plastic where my food goes, taking over the kitchen with a prop-making project, the plastic starts to cool when moving it around, etc. So I found a small space heater that is meant to hang from a shop ceiling to use as the source of heat to soften the plastic.

A vacuum former works by heating up and thereby softening/slightly melting a thin sheet of plastic. That malleable sheet is then pulled down over an object that sits on a flat bed of holes. Once the plastic is pulled down over the object and sealed around the bed, a vacuum pulls the air from under the sheet through the holes and the plastic sucks down into the object's nooks and crannies creating the vacuum formed shape.

To keep the heat source above the vacuum bed, I built a box out of 1/2 inch thick MDF and mounted the heater in it. The vacuum box was built in the exact same way and I used the CNC to drill a bunch of holes for the air to escape. I had to drill a large hole in the vacuum box's side panel so I can attach the shopvac hose directly to the lower box.

Some aluminum angled stock¬†will act as the vertical supports. We guesstimated the amount of sag that the plastic would have when heated and added some space for a tall-ish object laying on the vacuum bed and that was my height dimension. I screwed the aluminum supports directly into the two MDF boxes and the vacuum former took shape.

To hold the plastic sheets up near the heat source and to bring it down on top of the object, you need a material support frame. This is a two-part frame that will act as a clamp on all sides of the material as well as a pulling mechanism that should seal to the vacuum bed. I decided to use some 3/16 inch thick steel flat bar because it would be rigid over the 24 inch span without much support. After welding up the two frames independently, I added two simple handles to one of them. You have to make sure to grind the welds flat, especially where a tight seal would be needed like the bottom and where the material would be held.

Furthermore, I added some simple MDF handles to the sides incase the frame got too hot for my hands. The two frames would be held together with some flat-bottom binder clips¬†¬†and held up near the heater using some magnets suspended on long screws. This will keep the frame in place whilst heating and still allow me to pull the material down with minimal force.

On our first test pull we learned a lot. First, plexiglass is super brittle when vacuum formed and didn't work that great. Second, the space heater's radiant heating area was smaller than I thought, but it still worked well enough. Third, the binder clips prevented a perfect seal with the vacuum bed, so I needed to add some extra gaskets. Thin EVA foam cut into strips would acts as a seal when the material frame sat on the vacuum bed. I lined the outer perimeter with the EVA foam, and then added small pieces in the areas that wouldn't touch the binder clips. This made little notches in the gasket so that I could line up the clips in the same place each time.

Our second test went much better and it was time to switch to some more appropriate, polystyrene sheets. The white polystyrene sheets heated up and drooped like I've seen in professional-grade vacuum formers. I turned on the shopvac right before pulling down the material frames and wham! Good pull. The white plastic sucked down to the vacuum bed and the camera I was forming was wrapped perfectly. It was a success!

Special thanks to Alex Ramos, Kiilani goo-vidinha, Jacob Bisby, Ben Bundy & all my patrons

The $20 bass is a Roytek found at a flea market a while ago, it is very dirty and damaged.
The $620 bass is my signature Davie504 bass by Chowny;

The $5,000 bass is from Supra Basses, many thanks for sending it to me! (last time I checked it was $5,000 USD, but there might be a discount price now)

It‚Äôs Official! The Keeping Up With The Kardashians midseason trailer just revealed major news!

I knew they were gonna announce the pregnancy on the show. 

So much has happened on Keeping Up With The Kardashians this season, but there is still so much more to come. First let‚Äôs talk about Rob. It looks like he‚Äôs still dealing with baby mama drama and the family is hoping they don‚Äôt get back together. 

Speaking of drama, there may be drama between Corey and Khloe. In the trailer Khloe confronts Corey and Tristan has something to say about it too.

Kendall is still having anxiety issues and at one point during the trailer Kris is on the phone asking if she needs to take her to the hospital.  Also, in the trailer, the family is upset about something posted on TMZ and Kim, while laying in bed says sue the shit out of them. Can‚Äôt wait to see what that‚Äôs about. Anyway, lets get to the best part of the trailer. Of course everybody is still waiting for a confirmation from Khloe and Kylie regarding their pregnancies right?! But based on the latest trailer released to promote the rest of the season, we just got the closest thing to a confirmation yet. Watch this and then we will discuss.

Guys, come on. Based on those reactions, we are for sure going to find out that Khloe is pregnant on the show. Kris, Malika, and Khadijah were all crying. What other news would bring them to tears? This pretty much confirms it. Noticeably absent from this trailer is Kylie, but she did make an appearance via phone call. 

Who‚Äôs getting arrested? So many questions! But Let us know in the comment section below and of course thanks for hanging out with me here on Newsfeed. I‚Äôm your host Emile Ennis Jr. and I‚Äôll see you next time. 

And then click to the left to see Khloe Kardashian accidentally reveal her baby bump. This episode was brought to you by T-Mobile. Switch to America's best unlimited network.

This is part one of what will hopefully be a series of what Stella and I do together when she's off the clock and not saving my life.

When Stella has her vest on, she knows it's time to work and she's super focused on me and her tasks. When her vest is off, she knows she's allowed to play and be a dog. It's super important for service dogs to have a balance of ""work"" and ""play,"" otherwise they can get burnt out just like humans.

Drew Lynch is a comedian with a stutter and this is his dog with a name that's Stella.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

Trump and Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, both made threats before the Security Council vote - warning nations of the consequences they faced if they didn't support the US move. 

The non-binding resolution was approved at a UN General Assembly emergency meeting on Thursday with 128 votes in favour and nine against, while 35 countries abstained.

Turkey's president reacted swiftly, saying the result proved that ""the world is bigger than five and much bigger than one"".

Meanwhile, Palestine's ambassador to the UN accused the US of using ""unprecedented tactics ... including blackmail and extortion."" 

Beyond the immediate focus on Jerusalem, what will the vote's long-term impact be on American diplomacy at the UN, in the Middle East and around the world?

And will Trump and Haley's threats backfire, even if Washington does not follow through on its promise to cut aid to countries that voted against it?

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-herodotus-called-the-father-of-history-mark-robinson

2,500 years ago, the writing of history as we know it didn‚Äôt exist. The past was recorded as a list of events, with little explanation for their causes beyond accepting things as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides to understand the reasons for them. Mark Robinson explains how ‚Äúhistory‚Äù came into being.

Harry Styles just one upped Prince Harry‚Äôs recent engagement announcement by doing something super sweet for everyone to see. 

The thing in question? Oh, it was nothing but a sweet little kiss. 
It‚Äôs safe to say that Lorde is probably the envy of many Harry stans around the world after her and Harry‚Äôs little interaction at the ARIA Awards. Let me set up the story for ya. So both Harry and Lorde were up for Best International Artist and when Harry was named the winner of the night, he made his way up to the stage to accept his award‚Ä¶but not before stopping by Lorde‚Äôs seat to give her a hug and a couple kisses. 

That was probably one of the cutest moments of the night and we weren‚Äôt the only ones who thought that. 

After the sweet gesture, one fan tweeted, ‚ÄúNot to be dramatic but Harry kissing and hugging Lorde on his way to receive his award just added 30 years to my life.‚Äù Another wrote in all caps: ‚ÄúLorde be getting two kisses from Harry. I am dead. What a gentleman.‚Äù 
One ARIA viewer gave us all a play-by-play as well as her shocked reaction when she wrote, ‚ÄúLorde thought Harry was gonna kiss her once so she was about to sit down but he kissed her other cheek. Wow.‚Äù

While another wrote, ‚ÄúI guess the excitement I feel about Harry and Lorde kissing at the ARIAs tonight is how most people feel about the royal engagement.‚Äù Sorry Prince Harry, Harry and Lorde kissing is just a bigger deal than your exciting engagement to Meghan Markle. I guess you just can‚Äôt win them all. 

What did you guys think of Harry and Lorde‚Äôs interaction? Was it the cutest thing you‚Äôve ever witnessed or what?! Let me know in the comment section below. Thanks for hanging with me on Clevver Newsfeed, I‚Äôm your girl Jackie Iadonisi, don‚Äôt forget to subscribe and I‚Äôll see ya next time!

Q: When do I use the parity algorithm?
A: After solving edges, but before solving corners; and ONLY IF you have parity.

Q: How do I know if there is parity?
A: If you need to memorize an odd number of corners and an odd number of edges.

Q: Would I ever have to memorize an even number of edges, but odd number of corners? Or vice versa?
A: No, they should always be both even or both odd, otherwise you made a mistake.

Q: How do I remember how to undo a setup move?
A: When you do setup moves, imagine the piece moving along a path towards the swapping spot. After the swap, try to move the piece back along the same path towards its home location.

Q: What do I do for flipped pieces?
They're just like new cycles.
Edges: 5:10
Corners: 10:37

Q: How do I remember which pieces I have already visited in memorization?
A: You can start with placing your fingers on the ones you have been to, and as your memorization gets faster it will become easier and you won't need your fingers.
What I do during my solves now is memorize corners first. For example if corners has an odd number of letters, then edges must too. If I think I've memorized enough edges and I have memorized an odd number as well, then I've probably got them all. The only thing that could be missing is flipped pieces (since the shortest non-flip cycle adds 3 letters, which would make it even, not odd).

Q: How do new cycles work?
A: Pick any unsolved piece (memorize it), then follow through the pieces (memorizing each one) until you reach the same piece you started with (memorize that piece again). 3:49

Q: What if my buffer piece is solved?
A: Start a new cycle with an unsolved piece. 5:10

Q: What if my buffer piece is in the right spot and flipped?
A: Then something else on the cube must be unsolved. Solve everything else, and the buffer will automatically be solved.

Q: I did a swap using the setup moves below. Why did the piece end up in the correct spot and flipped?
A: Each piece has multiple letters for it, depending on which exact sticker you are swapping with. For example, the top front edge has the letters C and I. Make sure you choose the right one.

Q: When I thought I finished, why were there still flipped pieces?
A: Either (1) you made a mistake during memorization and chose the wrong letter or (2) in the beginning the piece was already in the right spot and flipped, but you didn't notice and didn't solve it.

INFINITI VC-Turbo Engine - Sponsored by INFINITI
Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7

Infiniti's has developed the first variable compression ratio engine which will ever be used in a production vehicle. The compression ratio can vary from a highly boosted 8:1 ratio, to an Atkinson-cycle running 14:1 ratio. What this means is the engine can produce significant horsepower by using the low compression ratio with a turbocharger, or it can achieve excellent fuel economy by using a high compression ratio and an efficient engine cycle. Now there aren‚Äôt simply to modes the engine runs in, it can vary and run at any compression ratio between 8:1 and 14:1, allowing for optimal performance and efficiency for whatever the driving condition may be.

This video will discuss:
1. What is a compression ratio?
2. Why is it beneficial to change the compression ratio?
3. How does the engine alter the compression ratio?
4. What are the advantages of the VC-Turbo engine?
5. What are the balancing characteristics of the VC-Turbo engine?
6. How did INFINITI test this engine for durability and reliability?

The VC-Turbo engine will debut in the 2019 INFINITI QX50. It‚Äôs also incorporated within the Q Inspiration, a concept car INFINITI developed to speak to their new interior and exterior design language.

Jennifer Aniston takes AD inside her dreamy California home high above Los Angeles, Jennifer Aniston crafts a scene of pure domestic bliss with husband Justin Theroux, a spectacular midcentury house, and a trio of very happy dogs.

Aniston‚Äôs latest residential project is the reimagining of a Bel Air house that was designed by architect A. Quincy Jones and completed in 1965.

The actress acquired the property in 2011, after selling her beloved Hal Levitt‚Äìdesigned home in L.A.‚Äôs Trousdale Estates enclave (AD, March 2010) and attempting to relocate to Manhattan‚Äîa move ultimately thwarted by the rabid paparazzi that swarmed outside her Greenwich Village apartment building. When she bought the Bel Air property, it had recently emerged from a renovation by architect Frederick Fisher, which, despite its sympathetic embrace of Jones‚Äôs vision, skewed a bit too cool and minimal for Aniston‚Äôs taste.

Aniston enlisted the aid of AD100 interior designer Stephen Shadley, with whom she had collaborated on her previous L.A. home, to perform a similar alchemy in Bel Air‚Äînamely, to preserve the modernist ethos of the original scheme while softening some of its sharp lines and outfitting the interior with tactile, organic finishes and furnishings.

Aniston seconds the notion, pointing to the vintage Jean Roy√®re Polar Bear sofa, Jacques Adnet armchairs, and Mies van der Rohe daybed arranged in the living room. Aniston credits the home‚Äôs deftly layered interiors to a team effort, with important contributions by Shadley and L.A. designers Kathleen and Tommy Clements and Jane Hallworth. Theroux weighed in as well.

Aniston describes the centuries-spanning decor as ‚ÄúOld World meets New World,‚Äù a polyglot mix of hand-painted wallpaper and midcentury furniture, silk rugs and polished concrete, antique Japanese screens and Abstract Expressionist paintings. Yet for all the pedigreed pieces on display‚Äîartworks by Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, and Glenn Ligon; furnishings by Vladimir Kagan, Edward Wormley, and Arturo Pani‚Äîthe real triumph rests in the harmony of the various decorative compositions within Shadley‚Äôs reconceived interior architecture.

Garden designer Marcello Villano and landscape architect Anne Attinger reorganized the alfresco spaces as a series of interconnected outdoor rooms, terraces, and Asian-inspired pocket gardens.

Extra care was taken in preparing Stella's dishes to ensure all the ingredients on her plate were suitable for her refined canine palate, which is why you might notice some differences between Drew and Stella's plates. Drew's food was seasoned separately and any ingredients that were not dog-friendly were omitted from Stella's dish.

American children Danny, Hannah, Bradley, and Bri, are four of the smallest people in the world. Their syndrome is the rarest of all the 200 types of dwarfism and is characterised by tiny stature, a high-pitched squeaky voice, and limited life expectancy. Primordial dwarfs are also the smallest of all those affected by any one of the different types of dwarfism. The syndrome is caused by a recessive gene, and all primordial dwarves are born to average-sized parents who are both carrying it. The gene is so rare it is yet to be identified. There is estimated to be roughly 100 primordial dwarves living in the world, with 40 of them based in the US.

JUSTICE LEAGUE REVIEW:
https://www.geek.com/movies/moviebob-reviews-justice-league-2017-1722863/

Yeah, it's bad. You already knew that. But how did something get THIS bad?

How does a project with so much at stake go so wrong in such a profound, all-encompassing way? At moment when the comic-book superhero genre is at its zenith, BATMAN V SUPERMAN was seemingly holding a winning hand: A celebrated, stylish director. A powerhouse cast. 80+ years worth of cherished American pop-mythology to draw from. Some of the most popular characters of all time. Dumptrucks full of Warner Bros' money to spend. And on top of all that, a moviegoing public hungry enough for an alternative to the Marvel Cinematic Universe formula for a pitch like ""depressing, ultra-violent, pitch-dark 9/11-themed SUPERMAN movie"" to sound (almost) like a good idea.

And yet, the end result was among the great cinematic calamities of the last decade; receiving scathing reviews, a near record-setting box-office dropoff, enraged notices from many fans and sarcastic ""thank you's"" from people named Martha. Even today, the shockwave from the film's negative reception are being felt as the studio continues to reshuffle the slate of films it was meant to inspire, JUSTICE LEAGUE continues to be transformed in post-production and the word ""reboot"" begins to fill the air. While not unprofitable or without its own unironic fans, the film seems destined to go down as one of the most infamous releases in the history of the genre.

In PART 2, we dive deep into the story-structure, themes and individual sequences that add up to one of the most bafflingly ill-conceived features of all time; including in-depth  focus on the infamous ""Knightmare"" and ""Martha Moment"" scenes!

""Black Vortex"", ""Disco Lounge"", ""Marty Gots a Plan"", ""Oppressive Gloom"", ""The Curtain Rises"", ""Ultralounge"", ""Wizardtorium,"" ""Inspire""

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television‚Äôs most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in ‚ÄúEmpire: The Movie,‚Äù Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important ‚Äì Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

An exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary.

#GringoMovie

About Gringo:
Mild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company‚Äôs Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hern√°n Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he‚Äôll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she‚Äôs having an affair.

Targeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he‚Äôs been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold‚Äôs prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.

Pursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.
Directed by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse. But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world. When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

#ReadyPlayerOne is the new science fiction movie by Steven Spielberg, starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Ben Mendelsohn. The script was written by Eric Eason.

Nicknamed the ""swamp king,"" the catfish was stranded in shallow water more than two miles away from its home. The rescuers hauled the fish out with a giant net and transported it back home on a motorbike trailer, with the entire rescue taking more than six hours. The Mekong giant catfish is the world‚Äôs largest scaleless freshwater fish and are also endangered. Overfishing and habitat destruction threaten the survival of this wild species.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

We grew up eating spicy tamarind candies in my country Nepal its brought back a lot of memories eating the Pulparindo, Mango Pop. The chips Sabritones was so crunchy and sour. Felt like it lacked in flavor a bit but I couldn't stop eating it for some reason haha. The Gansito and Mazapan(Not a fan of peanuts) were a bit too sweet in my opinion but the Coco Bandera was amazing.

9. Clams
""Tridacna giant clam"" by Nhobgood under License CC 3.0

8 - Rat-Tail fish‚Ä¶
These fish, also known as grenadiers, are one of the oldest fish families in the ocean! Strangely, they‚Äôre closely related to the cod, these fish are not only found in shallower waters, but many habitat the deep waters of the Mariana Trench. They have a remarkable sense of smell and eat other small fish and crustaceans. They‚Äôre slow moving fish and generally conserve their energy for the hunt. 

7 - Deep-sea hatchetfish‚Ä¶ 
No guesses as to why this deep-sea fish is called a hatchet fish, and a number of these guys have been spotted in the Mariana Trench. There are more than 40 different species of this fish, and they generally all grow to around 6-inches. They sport bioluminescent bodies and depending on how much light is filtering from above, they can alter the amount of light their bodies give off. The dimmer the light they give off, the less chance they have of producing a silhouette, making it more of a challenge for predators to spot them. 

6 - Ooze‚Ä¶
There‚Äôs no better word to describe what you would most likely be standing on if you were to ever make yourself to the very bottom of the Mariana Trench. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to be exposed to lovely sand like you find on the beach, but rather a disgusting ooze that has trickled through the depths and settled at the bottom. Everything from crushed shells to the corpses of plankton, have made their way to the bottom. The sludge would be grayish-yellow, fine and almost silky in texture. You have to wonder what it would smell like if it ever did make its way to the surface. 

5 - Protists‚Ä¶
We mentioned earlier that the deepest part of the Mariana Trench is called the Challenger Deep, and it‚Äôs just under 36,000-feet. There you will find a life-form called a protist. They‚Äôre not animals, but rather single-celled organism that are believed to be some of the very first forms of life here on Earth. 

4 - Frilled sharks‚Ä¶
This crazy looking shark has said to be around for 80 million years, and little has changed in its appearance. The shark has 6 rows of frilly gills which can reach up to 6-feet long. The shark also has over 20 rows of sharp teeth that will do severe damage to anything that dares cross its path. Luckily, they prefer the bottom of the ocean, and although one has been caught on the odd occasion, they don‚Äôt survive making it impossible to study them. 

3 - A monument‚Ä¶
Ok, not in the way that you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ but when George W Bush was still in power, he signed a document that designated the Mariana Trench as a national monument. So, although you can‚Äôt get down there now and buy your souvenirs, perhaps it‚Äôs only a matter of time until you can. Now that it‚Äôs a national monument, fishing and mining in the trenches are strictly forbidden. You can swim though, although I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd want to considering what‚Äôs hidden in those waters. 

2 - Telescope octopus‚Ä¶
These bizarre looking deep-sea dwellers don‚Äôt flit across the ocean floor like regular octopi, but rather drift through the waters at around 6,500-feet. They also don‚Äôt swim horizontally, but suspend themselves vertically, possibly to distract predators. The telescope octopus is almost see-through, and there‚Äôs a delicate webbing between it‚Äôs tentacles, giving it a ghostly shape. And the cherry on the cake? Two protruding eyeballs providing the octopus with ultra-wide peripheral vision so it can see predators and prey and helping it make its way through the murky, dark depths.

A few years ago there was a trend for 29ers that were short on travel but big on fun. 

Plucky, fearless little rippers that punched way above their weight. 

We‚Äôre talking about bikes like the old Specialized Camber Evo, Kona Process 111 and Evil the Following. 

Well Cotic‚Äôs new Flare Max captures the spirit of those benchmark models and moves the game on again. 

The Droplink suspension gives 120mm of travel out back, configured in a super-progressive fashion. 

So it responds instantly to your inputs and delivers a snappy, poppy ride quality that‚Äôs completely addictive. 

And the geometry and sizing are generous, without being excessive, so confidence goes through the roof and you can‚Äôt help attacking trails with the kind of contempt normally reserved for something boasting much more travel. 

Obviously this can get you in a bit of trouble, but the stability of the chassis helps keep the Flare on your side. 

Equally, the frame construction, with its signature Reynolds 853 steel front triangle and bridgeless seatstays, wants to find the path of least resistance, so you don‚Äôt get knocked off line as easily as you might with a super stiff frame. 

And with the 29er wheels wrapped in some aggressive tyres, you can take liberties with the Flare that you wouldn‚Äôt have thought possible. 

Changes over the previous model include a new back end with new alloy forgings for extra stiffness, single-ring only frame design, revised geometry with longer reach and a more progressive kinematics. 

The size large 29er we rode had a 480mm reach, 65 degree head angle and 1,246mm wheel base with a 130mm travel fork. 

And there‚Äôs room to run 27.5in wheels and Plus tyres if that‚Äôs more your cup of tea. 

Prices run from ¬£1,500 for the frame only, and ¬£2,800 for a full build with Shimano SLX and X-Fusion suspension.  

As you can probably tell, we really liked the Flare MAX. 

Although it was only a brief ride, it reminded us of Scooby Doo‚Äôs diminutive nephew, Scrappy, who was always up for a fight, however big or scary the adversary. 

We can‚Äôt wait to get our hands on one for a bit longer.

Chevy has been full of surprises lately.  Unfortunately they've all been terrible.  In this latest attempt, Chevy surprises ""Real People"" by having their families pop out of a Traverse.  What's the point?  We have no idea, but we do know that these families are way too happy to see each other.  Who actually enjoys family visits?  Certainly not Mahk, unfortunately for him he's about to get a surprise of a lifetime.

Phoenix, Arizona

I‚Äôve eaten In-N-Out Burger before and I‚Äôve eaten Five Guys before‚Ä¶ but this was my first time to ever eat them back to back. In this video I‚Äôm taking you on a full burger review comparison between In-N-Out and Five Guys, two burger chains with extremely loyal followings.

In-N-Out Burger

I ordered the Double Double and extra crispy fries. Now to keep things consistent for the review, I couldn‚Äôt go all crazy with their secret menu of toppings, so all I ordered was extra onions.

Prices - Double Double - $3.85, Extra crispy fries - $1.80

The Double Double from In-N-Out is indeed extremely tasty and salty and it has an amazing balance of tastes and everything goes together in such harmony. However, after finishing the Double Double I walked away still quite hungry.

Five Guys

Next we drove over to Five Guys, luckily just a 5 minute drive from In-N-Out Burger. Again, I kept it pretty simple and just ordered their cheeseburger all the way, and a side of regular fries. You‚Äôll notice immediately that the prices are twice as high as In-N-Out, however, we‚Äôll find out that their burger weight probably twice as much as well.

Prices - Cheeseburger - $7.99, Fries - $4.29

The Five Guys Cheeseburger is heavy and dense, and they already press down the bun for you, so it‚Äôs not fluffy at all. The ingredients inside are great, and I especially enjoyed the mushrooms inside. The burger is definitely not as salty as In-N-Out, however it tastes better quality.

VERDICT:

It sort of depends on what mood you‚Äôre in, and you do have to take into account that Five Guys is twice as expensive as In-N-Out - so you could eat two Double Doubles for the same price as one Five Guys cheeseburger.

I think the In-N-Out Double Double is tastier, possibly because it‚Äôs saltier, but the Five Guys burger tastes fresher, more natural, and a little more home-cooked styles. Overall, I would choose Five Guys more often than In-N-Out Burger. That‚Äôs my final verdict.
What about you? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!

It explores why Canadian communities are at a turning point when it comes to recycling and exploring ways to do it better. Much of the reason is because of a decision by China to crack down on foreign waste. About half of the world's recyclables were being sent to China, but China stopped importing them. Now, many Canadian municipalities are stockpiling materials because they have nowhere to send them.

We've been dying to record this one since we watched the very first episode of Westworld last year, and finally got the chance when Cicely came to visit a few weeks ago! Some of you might recognize Cicely from her work with Patrick's band Break of Reality. She's a great friend and phenomenal cellist who is in demand all over the world as a classical soloist. We're honored to collaborate with her! 
We also asked Cicely to arrange Bach's 1st Cello Suite (originally for solo cello) for 3 cellos to record with Patrick for our Brooklyn Classical channel. She was up for the challenge and the arrangement is AWESOME. üòçüòçüòç Patrick, Cicely and fellow amazing cellist Christine Lamprea recorded audio for all 6 movements (all available on Spotify, iTunes, and everywhere else) and 3 videos. Watch the Prelude HERE: http://bit.ly/2FgRKs5

Sheet music for Westworld is up on MusicNotes, and the track is up on Spotify, too. üòä

Previously I have done a video for people who want to start drawing, but with a lot of new subscribers from experimental videos I wanted to introduce people uninterested in drawing to why they should start drawing. 
This video reiterates a few things from previous videos,, but in a perspective for someone who has little knowledge about drawing or art.

SUMMARY
- If you're one of these people and you want your pooch to¬†look after your home, you should probably consider a¬†Rottweiler,¬†Doberman Pinscher, or¬†German Shepherd. 
- If you have a big family full of kids or just welcomed a newborn into this world, it can seem challenging to pick the perfect dog breed. But this is the territory¬†where a¬†Labrador or¬†Golden Retriever would be completely¬†unbeatable!
- Consider getting a Pointer or¬†a Setter since they‚Äôre pretty much built for running. If¬†you want something a¬†bit smaller, a¬†Jack Russell Terrier can be¬†a¬†good choice as well. 
- If you‚Äôre looking for a furry cuddle buddy who will always be happy to¬†laze around on the sofa with you, a¬†French Bulldog or¬†a¬†Maltese is your perfect fit. 
- Some breeds deal with being home alone better than others: think about getting a¬†Shar Pei or¬†a¬†Basset Hound. 
- If¬†you‚Äôre retired and have decided to welcome a dog into your home, a¬†good option for you would be¬†a¬†Boston Terrier, a¬†Pug, or¬†a¬†Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. 
- . If¬†the dog is¬†small, it¬†doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it‚Äôll be¬†happy living in smaller space. Consider getting a¬†Yorkshire Terrier or¬†a¬†Bulldog for a small apartment. 
- Retrievers, Collies, and Spaniels are always happy to¬†have company to¬†play with, so they‚Äôll likely make a great match with your other pets. Terriers or¬†breeds typically used in dogfighting can sometimes be a bit complicated. 
- Most Terriers can take the heat, and they come in¬†lots of sizes. At the same time, St. Bernards, Samoyeds, and Boxers won't feel good in hot weather. 
 - Breeds that prefer a colder climate normally have a¬†thick double coat and more body fat. So, as you can probably guess, a¬†good choice is¬†a¬†St. Bernard, Malamute,¬†Husky, or¬†Samoyed. 
- German Shepherds aren't a good breed for you due to¬†their dry skin, which results in a¬†lot of¬†dander built-up. The same goes for long-haired breeds as well.  
- Getting a dog for the first time ever is both exciting and nerve-racking. There are so many breeds to choose from, and they‚Äôre all so cute and adorable! If¬†you‚Äôre new to the dog-owning world, then a¬†Labrador,¬†Border Collie, or¬†Poodle will be¬†perfect for you.

The house clocks in at nearly 9,000 square feet. Past the front door there‚Äôs the gorgeous grand stairway with its original wrought-iron balustrade, straight out of a movie from Hollywood‚Äôs Golden Age. Then room after room bathed in glorious sunlight, gurgling fountains, and that heavenly oak tree, literally topping everything off. And, of course, there‚Äôs Poppy, the mistress of the manor. Not even Central Casting could produce a more scrumptious sprite.

The house's facelift entailed installing floors of antique marble to demarcate points of entry and transition; stripping, bleaching, and waxing the existing mahogany paneling in the dining room; replacing fireplace mantels and hardware with antique models; reworking the kitchen with new fixtures and surfaces; and furnishing the many rooms of the home in signature Berkus-Brent style.

As for what constitutes clean and masculine in this context, the designers layered the house with rustic French, Swedish, and American furnishings of wood and stone, juxtaposed with more tailored Continental pieces by the likes of Jacques Adnet, Maria Pergay, Angelo Mangiarotti, and Afra and Tobia Scarpa.

The through line is the doggedly neutral palette; Berkus and Brent rely on texture and patina to animate their personal interiors.

The one exception to the rainbow-of-beige rule is Poppy‚Äôs bedroom and playroom.  In her bedroom, Poppy has the beginnings of a proper art collection, stocked with gifts from her parents‚Äô friends, including a dreamy mobile by Julia Condon and a Michael Hainey hummingbird painting.

For Berkus and Brent, the one other space that seems to deviate from the distilled masculinity of the rest of the house is the master bathroom, which features hand-painted murals by James Mobley along with architectural details of a Prunella marble richly veined in deep purple and brown.

The couple took advantage of the ample space beyond the bathroom to install two very serious his-and-his closets.

In the atrium, a 19th-century bench with Kravet-velvet upholstery sits atop antique Spanish tiles from Paris Ceramics. 19th-century English glass pendant; 1950s low table from a Paris flea market; vintage club chair in a Carolina Irving Textiles stripe.

In the living room, a sofa by Afra and Tobia Scarpa for Cassina, a circa-1950 Italian chair, and a pair of 1940s linen club chairs surround a marble cocktail table from Hollywood At Home. A 1950s Italian sconce hangs above a 1960s English bench covered in a Lee Jofa fabric; Belgian linen curtains by RH.

In the kitchen, the island is surrounded by circa-1960 French barstools; sink fittings by Waterstone; 19th-century French lanterns. Backsplash and surrounding countertops by Ollin Stone; Whitechapel brass knobs.

In the dining room, 1950s Jacques Adnet chairs join a 19th-century English table. A painting by Matt Connors hangs above a Directoire limestone mantel; circa-1970 Georges Pelletier ceramic pendant lights.

In the gallery, a 19th-century Italian bookcase, an 18th-century Swedish table, and a 1950s American bench.

The playroom's ""memory"" board and table, by RH Baby & Child; sofa and rug by RH Teen. Floor pillows and hippo basket from Anthropologie.

In Poppy's room, a wallpaper by Apparatus and ZAK + FOX hosts art by Hunt Slonem, Michael Hainey, Fernando Bengoechea, and Mary Little. A Julia Condon mobile hangs over an armchair by Cisco Home wearing a Mexican Otomi textile; crib, table, and chair by RH Baby & Child; Nate Berkus stool for Target; Caitlin Wilson rug.

In the master bath, a James Mobley mural and marble molding and panels from Waterworks. Tub by Signature Hardware, with Waterworks fittings; Duravit sink.

Brent and Berkus's RH bed, dressed in Matteo linens, is flanked by 1970s Italian tables. The circa-1960 chairs wear an Edelman Leather suede. Circa-1950 French bronze saucer light; custom Roman shades by The Shade Store; Maria Pergay steel table; HD Buttercup rug.

The pergola is painted in Benjamin Moore's Alabaster. RH pendant lights; vintage Kreiss chairs; Pottery Barn pillows. Poppy wears a Marysia Bumby swimsuit.

LYRICS: 
Yes it‚Äôs really over now

that you are gonna miss 
and never see again

Yes it's really over now 
You're so good at letting me down

So Imma buy a bottle of the best
champagne
Imma raise a glass all to myself
in your name
and imma cry if i want to
its my party without you

I would always scream your name

something i will never miss 
now

so I‚Äôm putting on my favorite dress 
that you are gonna miss 
and never see again

Yes it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down 

So Imma buy a bottle of the best
champagne
Imma raise a glass all to myself
in your name
and imma cry if i want to
its my party without you
so heres to all the pain

The maps used in this video and other sources. First, our world in data is an AMAZING resource: http://ourworldindata.org

1. The world population divided into tenths: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8j2rso/each_section_has_10_of_the_worlds_population/

2. Peru and Somalia are bigger than you might expect: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8jif61/the_true_sizes_of_peru_and_the_usa_with/ and 
https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8f5vua/the_true_size_of_somalia/

3. Mean years of schooling have risen worldwide: https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education

4. CO2 emissions over time have risen. https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions

5. So has the temperature almost everywhere on Earth: https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/11/graphics-climate-change

6. This fascinating map of global borders shows how new most nation states are, and how recent their borders were established: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/7ndxz9/i_tried_to_find_the_date_of_origin_for_every/

7. A dramatic increase in the percentage of births attended by trained healthcare workers has contributed to a dramatic decline in maternal mortality worldwide: https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality

8. I'm not one of those people who think we're on the verge of conquering death, but we are delaying death significantly, although much work remains to be done, especially among impoverished communities. But in the last 35 years, life expectancy has increased by over ten years in most nations. Nothing like this has ever happened before--we've never seen a consistent, worldwide increase in life expectancy. Like, never. So that is worth celebrating. https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy

11:43 - Apple gives out badly refurbished boards as warranty replacements for 2011 GPU failures.
13:06 - 2012 Retina Macbook Pro: another motherboard issue (U8900), due to poor soldering/manufacturing method on the GPU buck converter.

18:23 - SSD soldered straight into the motherboard+ chip that would kill the macbook, because a power line would short out to ground when the chip dies.

Hey guys, so I know this is a very touchy topic and I never want to step on the toes of anyone when speaking on the issue - I had fully intended to do this same exact video but with a review attached trying the foundation, because the YouTuber side of me always thinks that way - this video is different than expected because I can't review the foundation for you because despite the formula, I don't support the way that Tarte launched this foundation without certain groups of people in mind. Their response has been insanely unprofessional and telling, and until they do better, I do not feel comfortable recommending this product to you no matter how good the formula. I shouldn't have supported this launch in the first place, because my morals do NOT align with their behavior, and I let my ""job as a reviewer"" stand in the way of my beliefs as a human being and I purchased them, knowing full well that I was not going to recommend them to you regardless, which was wrong on my part. I am not telling ANYONE who to support, or who not to support - that is your decision. But I have a platform, and as an influencer with an audience, It is my responsibility to responsibly recommend or NOT recommend products to you with knowing the full background of WHY. 

I can admit that I use other brands and foundations with shade ranges that are not insanely inclusive, and for that - I apologize. I always make it a point to point out shade ranges, so it is hypocritical of me to judge Tarte for something that other brands I support, do too. The thing is, Tarte just launched the most HIGHLY anticipated foundation of 2018, and that is why we hold them to a higher standard than most, because they had the opportunity here to do something BIG and amazing, and instead let everyone down with excluding SO many. I hope I got my point across correctly and that you understand where i am coming from in my due diligence of a social influencer, not to recommend products that I feel are morally wrong. I appreciate Tarte's apology and they have vowed to do better, but until we SEE that, its just words. I hope that you feel I am not speaking OVER anyone here, and that I am just tired of seeing this go on over and over again with no repercussions to brands that frankly have no excuse not to do EXACTLY what Fenty did with her foundation launching 40 inclusive shades. 

I love you guys and we will be back to regularly scheduled programming on Monday, but definitely let me know your thoughts in the comments, I appreciate each and every one of you and hope the world changes for the better, and exclusivity becomes a thing of the past.

Xu√¢n ƒë√£ v·ªÅ~ (or, not quite yet, but almost!)

What's your favorite season? In literature, spring symbolizes rebirth and renewal üå±

Today's makeup tutorial was actually inspired by a Fenty Beauty lipstick! I think the name ""Freckle Fiesta"" is so fun and I haven't done faux freckles in awhile. Plus, my natural freckles have gotten a lot darker recently so I decided this would be a nice way to embrace them instead of trying to cover them up all the time 
(¬¥ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ œâ ‚Ä¢ÔΩ°`) I know the camera didn't pick them up very well so I edited the thumbnail so u can see from far away ^^

I did a poll on Instagram and was pretty surprised to see that most of you prefer natural makeup looks to full glam! I will try to incorporate more natural looks like this into my channel üòô

I think most people think of light, natural makeup when they think of spring (in sharp contrast to fall makeup) so I hope this is something you can enjoy wearing for the blooming season üåº

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, where I did loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! Nail videos are too difficult to film + I prefer makeup!
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? 21

FAQ
Q) Can you use standard Data CDRs?
A) Yes - that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using in this video. See on-screen message at 10:30

REMOTE
Thanks for all the links to the remote on eBay - I had already seen that seller - they specialise in Superscope spares - However that remote is just for the CD recorder section, it costs a lot for what it is (including postage & duty) and I was never really all that invested in getting one. A viewer in the U.K. however has the full one that he is sending me as a favour.

NOPE
Quite a few people have stated that pressing the Record button again whilst the device is recording should increment the track number. It doesn't - perhaps they were thinking of another machine.

Drop your expectations and breathe.

No one expects you to master or jive with every practice. This journey is about spending time with yourself. Today we focus on building heat from the inside out. Burning away that which no longer serves in order to create powerful transformation.

This series is not a challenge, it is a journey. But today's practice might be challenging!

You have everything you need. Continue to ride the wave. Trust, observe and enjoy!

LYRICS:

Una mira te delata 
un perfume que te atrapa 
todo esta a mi favor 
ser√°n mis ojos de gata 
se que hay algo que te ata 
y quieres hac√©rmelo 

Delante de la gente 
me pones indecente
lo rico que se siente 
Pque nadie te lo cuente 

Que yo soy mala de verdad 
mala de verdad 
y a ti te gusta la maldad se te nota
Hay yo soy mala de verdad 
mala de verdad 
y a ti te gusta la maldad se te nota 

Eres mala mala 
Ma mala mal 
Eres mala mala 
Ma mala mal 

Soy mala 
Mala de verdad 
M√≠rame a la cara
Si no eres real 
Mejor que te vayas
No podr√°s quedarte en mi cama
Soy mala 
Asi Soy
Porque no conf√≠o en nadie
Se te nota que eres calle
Tienes ganas de probarme 
Quieres quemarme

Delante de la gente 
me pones indecente
lo rico que se siente 
Pque nadie te lo cuente 

Que yo soy mala de verdad 
mala de verdad 
y a ti te gusta la maldad se te nota
Hay yo soy mala de verdad 
mala de verdad 
y a ti te gusta la maldad se te nota 

Eres mala mala 
Ma mala mal 
Eres mala mala 
Ma mala mal 

Te gusta mi labial rojo como una rosa
De una vez quieres besarme directo a la boca
Soy Mala Mala Mala Mala y tambien soy loca 
Pero nadie me lo toca

Que yo soy mala de verdad 
mala de verdad 
y a ti te gusta la maldad se te nota
Hay yo soy mala de verdad 
mala de verdad 
y a ti te gusta la maldad se te nota

From pottery, to metal melting, to supercapacitors they are useful for anything that requires extremely high temperature. That said, they can also be prohibitively expensive, so getting started with these hobbies and research areas can seem like an insurmountable challenge. Luckily, building one of these simple devices is not only straight forward, it's also far cheaper than buying a new or used kiln.

Visit https://fcc.media.mit.edu/ to learn how you can take a stand to defend net neutrality before it's too late.

Media Lab associate director Andy Lippman explains how net neutrality works currently, and how the proposed changes would affect not only our consumption of media but our ability to innovate.

2017 was a pretty hard year for a lot of folks. But, one area that shined was the cinema.
I promised myself that I would do a Multifandom Mashup this year.
I wrote on a Post It (I have it since May on my desk): Multifandom Mashup; 7 min long; 2017.

It's not perfect, far from it tbh. But I couldn't be more proud, because it's done, I didn't give up
after all this time. (Not 7 min tho, the hell was I thinking?)
I just loved making it! You can definitely expect another next year! ;)

Are you crazy 
Just like me 
To let me close, to let me be 
The one 
Loves a gun

How to touch you 
Where to go  
With my fingers
With my tongue 
With my anger 
Loves a gun

From the delicious brains of Moonbite Games PadaOne Games and U&I Entertainment comes an enhanced and updated version of Zombeer, a first-person shooter that is an unapologetically irreverent homage to everything kick-ass about zombie movies and drinking beer.

With new narrative content from writers at Comedy Central, Zombeer is packed with humorous reference to classic zombie flicks of the past and, of course, a healthy supply of ammo and beer.

In the near (and some might say lucky) future, there is a pandemic as a result of a virus that transforms the world‚Äôs population into zombies. That‚Äôs not the lucky part ‚Äì it‚Äôs this: Once bitten by a zombie, the only way to stave off the infection is drinking beer!

Playing as the hero ‚ÄúK,‚Äù a survivor inflicted with the zombie virus and a wicked perpetual hangover, players must make their way through the zombie apocalypse managing a balance of sobriety and carnage to find his girlfriend Karen and get out before it‚Äôs too late!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aftl6z7ycLI/sddefault.jpg,0.015540872536234738,0.0005480216969598963,28.358133669609078,0.0009073801867696645,0.01608889423319463,0.016996274419964298,2018-04-01,04:36:11,Sunday,6,8,57,8,44,56,441,3,80,0,0,7,0,0,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.586787154621386,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

While Fall Out Boy has evolved through a slew of material, it‚Äôs impossible to forget where the fandom originally began. ‚ÄúThnks fr th Mmrs‚Äù was one of their crossover hits, peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2007.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ah9mtoYrXfg/sddefault.jpg,0.009481410296238082,0.00015999165626436296,59.26190476190475,0.0003117078820322934,0.009641401952502444,0.009953109834534738,2018-04-13,05:38:34,Friday,4,7,37,7,32,49,333,1,76,0,1,6,16,0,0,6.0,8.0,"['DOSEVELE.', ', sE~ >', '', 'iia', 'ei', 'ears', 'Da']","['DOSEVELE.', ',', 'sE~', '>', 'iia', 'ei', 'ears', 'Da']",True,"['dosevel', '.', ',', 'se~', '>', 'iia', 'ei', 'ear', 'Da']",9,9,23,3,0,1,0,6.6383712071892855,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

#BunnyEars #MacaulayCulkin

Craig, The Intern's Notes:

Day 1: Macaulay Culkin's new comedy website has taken over my entire life. It's pretty manageable though! I'm having a lot of fun so far! Even though he was the star of Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, and even Getting Even with Dad, everything seems to be really chill and relaxed here for now. It is kind of weird working for someone who even 70-year-old Armenian Uber drivers can recognize, but everyone here is really really nice. The workload also seems reasonable too. I think this will translate into an excellent career for me.

I'm optimistic that absolutely nothing will go wrong, that everything will be fairly straight forward, and that Macaulay Culkin's YouTube channel won't be too much for me to handle on my own. I am only an intern, after all.

This first video, a fireside chat with Macaulay Culkin, seems to have gone well. Matt Cohen (co-host of the Bunny Ears podcast) did the editing and the voice over himself, so everything was pretty funny. Wearing silly, weird, but still funny bunny ears has been Mack's thing for a while now, so it's cool to see him start his own lifestyle brand (And yes, he goes by ""Mack"" and it's spelled with a ""k"" for some reason.)

Like Oprah Winfrey's ""W,"" Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Goop,"" and George Forman's ""Grill,"" we now have Mack Culkin's ""Bunny Ears.""

Excited to see how everything works out for everyone!

Best,

Craig, The Intern",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aib8LDRQXyY/sddefault.jpg,0.03012135786589117,0.0018007941390302555,16.726708074534162,0.00733739723729098,0.03192215200492144,0.03925954924221242,2018-03-01,23:09:37,Thursday,3,6,46,6,33,36,394,0,62,1,0,5,20,2,1,5.0,8.0,['SUBSCRIBE!!! y'],"['SUBSCRIBE!!!', 'y']",True,"['subscrib', '!', '!', '!', 'y']",5,3,12,3,0,0,1,6.337170468204775,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'clock': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Welcome to the mom club, Khloe Kardashian! The 33-year-old reality star and Tristan Thompson, 27, officially became parents together on April 12, according to TMZ, and we are BEYOND thrilled for the couple! Sadly, the baby‚Äôs entrance into the world couldn‚Äôt have come at a more awkward time ‚Äî just days ago, Tristan was accused of cheating on Khloe with multiple woman on various occasions. It‚Äôs no secret that Khloe has been wanting to have a baby for years now, but we only wish she could have gotten her fairytale romance to go along with it.

Hollywood‚Äôs best-kept secret is the work stunt people do behind the scenes. You may never know whether you‚Äôre watching an actor or a stunt double. They bring our movies to life and make the action so thrillingly believable we are sucked right in. For years Jack Gill has campaigned to have stunt people be recognized by the Academy. So why can‚Äôt the dangerous and gritty side of filmmakers not take home their own Oscar? Well that‚Äôs just one secret Hollywood isn‚Äôt telling you.

Jack Gill has even started a campaign to have stunt people recognized properly within the industry, and even Steven Spielberg is on his side. Another gung-ho goodie is ‚ÄúThe Stand Up For Stunts‚Äù petition. Aside from these efforts for stunt people to celebrate their accomplishments, there are still dark secrets you don‚Äôt know. Are casualties being kept a secret? Are stunt people being paid enough for how dangerous their jobs are? Why can't stunt women drive? Is that fine line crossed too many times just to get the perfect shot, even though someone‚Äôs life is at risk? And on a lighter note, are all stunt doubles celebrity doppelganger...we think so‚Ä¶

Watch this video to find out all the thrilling secrets Hollywood doesn‚Äôt want you to know about stunt people and the work they do. We are going to reveal them all to you in this exclusive video. Now tune in, turn up, and enjoy!

Disney/Pixar‚Äôs Incredibles 2 opens in theatres June 15!

In ‚ÄúIncredibles 2,‚Äù Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack‚Äîwhose superpowers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don‚Äôt shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That‚Äôs what makes this family so Incredible.
