Lyrics:

I wanna be loved 
don‚Äôt want to be hated 
I wanna be friends
don‚Äôt want all this fake shit
I tried all of that
I‚Äôm giving it back 
I feel under pressure 
And i wanna relax 
I wanna be messed up 
Don‚Äôt wanna be jaded
 
I'm too mixed up (too mixed up)
I'm too many colors (too many colors)
I'm too mixed up (too mixed up)
I'm too many colors (too many colors)
 

Am i in love or just obsessed 
I didn't start this gorgeous mess
I'll play this song like half to death 
And everything's alright 


i wanna be soft 
i wanna be tasteful 
i wanna be fair 
i wanna be graceful
but i still love it when it's maxed out 
ass out 
lean hard 
pass out 
either way I wanna be grateful 

I'm too mixed up (too mixed up)
I'm too many colors (too many colors)
I'm too mixed up (too mixed up)
I'm too many colors (too many colors)
 

am i in love or just obsessed 
i didn't start this gorgeous mess
I'll play this song like half to death 
and everything's alright 

we wanna be cool 
we wanna be famous
we wanna be quiet 
we wanna be faceless

we want too many things 
to give them an answer on who we should be or what we believe 
hey we wanna be careless

We're too mixed up (too mixed up)
We're many colors (too many colors)
We're mixed up (too mixed up)
We're many colors (too many colors)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyKcilA1Frs/sddefault.jpg,0.015055723821566147,0.0,inf,0.0009703884494368807,0.015055723821566147,0.016026112271003028,2018-04-27,04:03:10,Friday,4,9,85,9,51,49,505,3,86,1,0,7,5,1,13,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.3359853283936385,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'kite': 1, 'sports ball': 1}",2

That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs January 26th, and if you get in line today, you‚Äôll likely receive one of the first Apple HomePod speakers by around February 9th. We were able to play around with one for about an hour to get some early impressions, and so far, so good. First off: It does sound pretty amazing.

The HomePod features a central woofer and seven high-frequency drivers, and it seemed like wherever we were in the room, sound quality was very good ‚Äì and quite loud. The HomePod‚Äôs built-in microphones sniff out your room‚Äôs acoustics and set up the sound accordingly, and it does a solid job of it. Speaking of setup, it was a breeze, as you‚Äôd likely expect from an Apple device. It also looks pretty good: Stylish but also low-profile, and it comes in two colors ‚Äì so far.

One music note: Siri will only control Apple Music by voice, not Spotify or Pandora and so on, but you can route those streaming tunes to the HomePod from your iPhone if need be. Siri worked as expected, although we had to ask twice a few times when the music was loud. And of course it works great with HomeKit-capable smart home toys. So is it perfect? Not quite. Check out our hands-on review and then decide if you want to drop $350 on it. Review: https://www.digitaltrends.com/smart-home-reviews/apple-homepod-review/

Letra de ¬´Me Niego¬ª

Es dif√≠cil abrir mis ojos y ya no verte.
Tu olor en la cama a√∫n sigue intacto.
Te he buscado en mis sue√±os deseando tenerte
y no encuentro tu rostro por m√°s que trato.

A√∫n quedan tus retratos en cada rinc√≥n de la casa y el silencio me habla de ti. Es que sobra tanto espacio desde que no est√°s, dar√≠a todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte, porque vuelvas.

Es que me niego a perderte, jam√°s nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥.
Es que me niego a perderte, jam√°s nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥, que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥.

No puedo asimilar que ya t√∫ no est√°s; sin ti nada es igual.
S√© que por el mundo no hay otra similar,
que t√∫ me hiciste, que no te puedo olvidar.
T√∫ me quieres a tu manera. Mi mente quisiera, encontrarme quisiera.
Mi coraz√≥n dice que por ti espera, que porque volvieras dar√≠a lo que fuera.

Pero es que t√∫, chica, con ese piquete
dices c√≥mo olvidarte. Y en tus ojos veo que mientes.
Ahora puedo decir: amor, sufrir lo que se siente.
Te sacar√© de mi mente y eso ser√° de repente.

Pero es que t√∫, chica, con ese piquete
dices c√≥mo olvidarte. Y en tus ojos veo que mientes.
Ahora puedo decir: amor, sufrir lo que se siente.
Te sacar√© de mi mente y eso ser√° de repente.
Y es que me niego a perderte, jam√°s nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥.
Y es que me niego a perderte, jam√°s nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥, que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥.

Me est√° matando la soledad.
Duele saber que ya no est√°s.
Quiero pensar que todo esto es mentira
y que al llamarte contestar√°s, al llegar la noche regresar√°s.
A√∫n podemos intentarlo, no te alejes de mi vida.

Yo sigo aqu√≠ confundido y solo,
llorando de noche, muriendo de d√≠a.
Viviendo esta agon√≠a no puedo entender que ya no seas m√≠a.
El c√≠rculo se cierra y el dolor me entierra.
Qu√© dif√≠cil es vivir en esta guerra
Me niego, aunque digas que estoy ciego. Desde que te fuiste soy un andariego.
A todo compromiso tarde le llego.
Distra√≠do, de tu foto no me despego
Si t√∫ eres mi vida, ¬øporque me liquidas?
Yo no provoqu√© tu partida. Necesito tu olor.
Necesito tu calor. Necesito verte encima de m√≠ en ropa interior.

A√∫n quedan tus retratos en cada rinc√≥n de la casa y el silencio me habla de ti. Es que sobra tanto espacio desde que no est√°s, dar√≠a todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte, porque vuelvas.

Es que me niego a perderte, jam√°s nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥.
Es que me niego a perderte, jam√°s nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥, que lo nuestro ya se acab√≥.

Male. Early 40s. It's a grizzly scene, one we don't see often: spontaneous combustion. The block is taped off because it's procedure, but it's not really necessary here. He's encased, perfectly preserved behind a screen. It's as if he's on display, for all to see. There's a battery nearby. Nobody can figure out if the fire first caught the top of his head or his beard. He is only succeeded by one, his wife, Mrs. Willy.

Ruth E. Carter r√©sum√© spans over 30 years of work that include Spike Lee‚Äôs 1988 hit, School Daze, as well as I‚Äôm Gonna Git You Sucka, Do the Right Thing, Mo‚Äô Better Blues, Malcolm X, What‚Äôs Love Got to Do With It, Amistad, and Selma. The Movie Talk crew get into her impressive body of work, as well as questions about her inspiration for Black Panther, whether or not she looked to the comic book source material for influence; what it‚Äôs like to work with Ryan Coogler and if traditional African culture informed her designs. The crew also get into her future projects, especially wondering if any of her designs make it into Marvel‚Äôs Avengers Infinity War. All this and more on a very special Collider Movie Talk.

This game is filled with so many memorable characters so we thought it would be fun to rank them in a character bracket. We picked eight characters from the game, purposefully excluding Link and Zelda because we already know they‚Äôre the best. For each character, we gave them a score from 1 to 5 on their personality, visual design, and sidekick factor. Everything was randomly seeded so it was really fun seeing which characters ended up against each other. Let us know in the comments how you‚Äôd rank them. We‚Äôll also leave all the details here so you can make your own bracket and try it with your friend. As always, thanks so much for watching and we‚Äôll see you next week!

The Characters:
¬∑        Revali
¬∑        Mipha
¬∑        Riju
¬∑        Urbosa
¬∑        Bolson
¬∑        Kass
¬∑        Sidon
¬∑        Daruk

The Rounds:
¬∑        Personality
¬∑        Visual Design
¬∑        Sidekick Factor

Over 50 years ago an engine was designed that overcame the inherent design inefficiencies of bell-shaped rocket nozzles, but despite much research in the 60's, 70's and 90's and was to power the replacement for the Space Shuttle.

I am so proud and excited to finally unveil the #strathberryxinthefrow limited edition, collaborative collection! Over the past 12 months myself and the team at Strathberry have been working closely to design a luxury collection of accessories and I couldn't be more in love with the outcome. With the combination of their incredible craftsmanship and design, complete with my personal limited edition touches, we have created a collection I am unbelievably proud to be a part of. I hope you fall in love with them, just as much as I have x

A few of the bags are sold out guys - and wont be being restocked! Im so sorry. Thankyou so so much to everyone who has treated themselves to something from the collection! xxx

Jessie Wilkins is from the other side of the tracks. When seated next to each other on a plane headed home for Christmas, these two teenage girls strike up an unlikely friendship. They soon find they‚Äôre both being forced to spend the holidays in the same small town with relatives they've never met. Neither girl is happy about their holiday arrangements so they devise a plan to switch places for Christmas. Jessie finds herself living lavishly with Kara's wealthy grandparents. Kara finds herself with Jessie‚Äôs fun, quirky grandmother and the most genuine, modest family she‚Äôs ever met. With a little help from Santa and a Christmas wish, Kara and Jessie find the families they've always wanted and discover an even bigger surprise they never expected.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

If you‚Äôve been following our channel for the past several months then you know we are obsessed with North Korea. And why not? The isolated nation is helping to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war. Mushroom clouds aside, the DPRK is so mysterious and it‚Äôs leader so strange that we just can‚Äôt help ourselves. Like any good dictator, Kim Jong-Un carefully controls his image. He probably wouldn‚Äôt like the other videos we‚Äôve made discussing the escape attempts and smuggled images coming from North Korea. So, this time, we‚Äôre here to show you 10 images that Kim wants the world to see ‚Äì and believe. From missiles and military to food, happiness and adventure ‚Äì Kim Jong-Un likely wants the world to see North Korea in a certain way and we think these images do the trick.

Lyrics: When will I sleep?
Where will I keep these miseries hiding out?
Where was the hit?
Where did I miss?
and when do you think that you‚Äôll be coming back?

Fear of alone
Fear of my own dark mysteries peering out
Get on the phone
Tell me you‚Äôre strong
Tell me I‚Äôm wrong
Tell me that you‚Äôre not gonna let me go

maybe I‚Äôm faded in love
maybe I don‚Äôt try enough
But my hope is just to find you
And I know its the littlest things
Maybe I‚Äôve been turning it off
Maybe it‚Äôs just a part of growing up
But my hope is just to find you
And I know its the littlest things
That hurt, that hurt, that hurt, that hurt

Keep me awake
Don‚Äôt ever  take these melodies coming through
You were the one
When I start to run
I‚Äôll be running back
To you

Maybe I‚Äôm faded in love
Maybe I don‚Äôt try enough
But my hope is just to find you
And I know its the littlest things
maybe I‚Äôve been turning it off
Maybe it‚Äôs just a part of growing up
But my hope is just to find you
And I know its the littlest things
That hurt, that hurt, that hurt, that hurt
That hurts That hurts That hurts That hurts That hurts That Hurts
Maybe I‚Äôm faded in love
Maybe I don‚Äôt try enough
But my hope is just to find you
And I know its the littlest things
maybe I‚Äôve been turning it off
Maybe it‚Äôs just a part of growing up
But my hope is just to find you
And I know its the littlest things

G
I grew pretty attached to you,

Like a dog on a lead.
                        Em
Thought you were everything I could ever of dreamed of

And more than I could ever need,
                      C
But you like boys, boys, boys

But you like boys, boys, boys
                                 G
And you don't like me.

G
Always thought you looked at me differently

Than anyone that you'd see.
                                  Em
Thought you were aching to see me

At any, any possibility.
                      C
But you like boys, boys, boys

But you like boys, boys, boys
                                 G
And you don't like me.

Em
I could be a bitch and tell you a million reasons why,
C
Being with me would be much better than with any other guy
             G
I could tell you I'll treat you right

And never wrong
                                                            D
Tell you in my arms is where you belong

But I know that you can't change someone

So I'll just leave you alone, although
                             C
I wish you liked girls, girls, girls

Wish you liked girls, girls, girls
                 G
Girls like me.


G
You could of had the decency to tell me
Everytime I'd kiss you
         Em
That women isn't really something

That you've ever been into
                       C
Cos you like boys, boys, boys

Cos you like boys, boys, boys
                                 G
And you don't like me

G
You could of had the kindness to turn me
down privately
                    Em
Instead of laughing about it with all of your friends

And talking shit about me
                       C
Cos you like boys, boys, boys

Cos you like boys, boys, boys
                                 G
And you don't like me


Em
I could be a bitch and tell you a million reasons why,

D
And I know you don't swing that way

But that won't take my feelings away

While you're here, help Ecosia plant trees around the world by simply searching the internet: https://ecosia.co/alternatives

Our tips include things like avoiding plastic shopping and produce bags, using reusable glass or stainless steel food containers, coffee mugs, and water bottles.  Doing a waste audit and researching what waste sorting options are available in your city or town (especially composting!!).  Getting inspired by documentaries, bloggers, and Instagram accounts.  Being a friendly activist and spreading the word about the importance of sustainable living, and reducing the amount of garbage we produce every day.

STEPHEN RAN DOWN TO THE POND TO SEE WHAT THIS POND MONSTER LOOKS LIKE ONCE AND FOR ALL!! 

Stephen heard some monster noises coming from the box fort trap so he ran down to the Sharer Fam pond and saw that the box fort cage had something inside. But before he lifted the cage, he wanted to safely get a closer look. So he called for the help of his brother, Carter. Together Steven and Carter fired up the drone and flew it over top of the box fort trap to see if they could get a glimpse of the monster. But the Sharer Bros had no luck as the drone wasn‚Äôt able to fly that close to the pond. So Steven decided to approach the cage by himself. What will the monster look like?! Comment #Monster if you think this pond monster will be friendly.

Lyrics:

When they gave you roses
And believed your wild excuses you were 
Sealing the deal
Halfway down the road and ain‚Äôt it funny how
The ghosts they fade and suddenly appear

You went too far 
Oh woman now you‚Äôre feeling the fear
Cause you‚Äôve never been alone before 
And the wolf is at the door
Now it‚Äôs better if you hold your breath and don‚Äôt look down 
At the pages of your paper crown

You reached out for more and as the waves hit at the shore you felt 
The fading of your will
Choke back the matter from the bottom of the ladder ask me 
If I love you still 

You went too far 
Oh woman now you‚Äôre feeling the fear
Cause you‚Äôve never been alone before 
And the wolf is at the door
And the hounds of hell they won‚Äôt lie down
On the ashes of your paper crown

In the bright light of the sun
Well you make sure everyone 
Could see your face
You made fun of everyone who falls
But meantime they were saving you a place

Cause you‚Äôve never been alone before 
And the wolf is at the door
And the talking heads don‚Äôt make a sound
At the ageing of your paper crown

Better if you don‚Äôt look down
At the pages of your paper crown",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KCmmtDMjG6I/sddefault.jpg,0.013629878066535905,0.00020383219458582863,66.86813186813187,0.0008571405105660487,0.013833710261121734,0.014690850771687785,2018-05-11,15:59:17,Friday,4,7,45,7,38,45,380,3,73,0,1,6,35,0,1,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.7986551441088094,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

1) Kevin Feige Addresses Disney/Fox Deal: What does it mean for Marvel?

2) The Rock Teams Up With Emily Blunt for Disney‚Äôs Jungle Cruise

3) First poster and title revealed for The Purge 4; entitled The First Purge

4) First ‚ÄòMute‚Äô Trailer Teases Duncan Jones‚Äô Sci-Fi Netflix Movie

If you‚Äôre wondering how long it‚Äôs going to take to see the fallout and/or benefits from the Disney-Fox deal hit the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don‚Äôt expect anything until after 2019 ‚Äì this according to Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige. 

Variety reports that Emily Blunt is set to star alongside Dwayne Johnson in Disney‚Äôs Jungle Cruise. Jaume Collet-Serra is on board to direct the film based on the Walt Disney ride, with Oscar nominated screenwriter for Logan, Michael Green, penning the most recent draft. Johnson has said that the project is inspired by The African Queen, with shades of Indiana Jones mixed in. 

AGREE / DISAGREE 

Blumhouse Productions and Universal have released the title and poster for The Purge 4, now known as: The First Purge. The fourth film in the popular horror franchise began in 2013 with filmmaker James DeMonaco‚Äôs home invasion thriller with a twist: one night a year in America all crime is legal, including murder. 

Netflix has released the first trailer for Mute, the new film from Moon and Source Code filmmaker Duncan Jones. The long-in-development sci-fi pic stars Alexander Skarsgard as a man unable to speak who‚Äôs searching for his missing girlfriend in future Berlin. 

Production is now officially underway on Blumhouse‚Äôs new take on Halloween. Danny McBride and filmmaker David Gordon Green, who previously worked together on Pineapple Express and the HBO series Eastbound & Down and Vice Principals, wrote the screenplay with Green directing the movie; said to take place forty years after the events of the first film.

Mark Rosati, Shake Shack's culinary director, explains the little details that set these burgers apart. Following is a full transcript of the video.

Mark Rosati:  Cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, Shack Sauce on a toasted potato bun. And what I like to do is right before I cook my patty is I‚Äôll toast my bun. Brush it with a little bit of butter and toast the inside so it gets a little bit of crunch on it ‚Äî which, great tip, because what you want to do is create contrast. So we use very soft potato buns. We want to get the inside just a little bit crunchy so you have that nice contrast with the soft, pillowy exterior, crunchy interior. Little details like that can really up your game.

Put all the elements on the bun so when that burger comes off and goes on the bun, you can eat it right away. You don‚Äôt want to wait, ‚Äòcause when the burger comes off it‚Äôs going to be nice and juicy and the cheese melty and drippy.

Last thing we need to do is cook the burger, which we are going to do right now. Next we‚Äôre going to smash our patty into the griddle, creating a nice, beautiful, even sear that‚Äôs going to create a lot of flavor for us. Add salt and pepper. And what we do is take the entire steak itself and grind that to make a burger. We‚Äôre looking for good fat content. For us, that‚Äôs somewhere around 20/80 ‚Äî 20% fat to 80% lean. If you really want something amazing, go a little higher ‚Äî go about 22% fat.

I‚Äôm going to take my spatula, and I‚Äôm going to raise it high and try to get all that crust off, ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs where the flavor is. And then give it a nice flip. See that nice golden-brown crust? That‚Äôs where all the flavor is, and that‚Äôs also locking in all the juices. Last thing: a slice of American cheese. See it‚Äôs all draping down nicely. It‚Äôs getting soft. That‚Äôs about the time you want to pull the burger off. You don‚Äôt want to go further than that.

Put it right down the center of the bun, and, as I was saying before, because the sauce, lettuce, and tomato are on there, I‚Äôm just going to shut it. That‚Äôs the ShackBurger.

David Allen has been involved in technology commercialization related research, instruction and practice since the mid 80‚Äôs. Vice President at University of Arizona is his latest and likely last institutional gig.  At Arizona he heads Tech Launch Arizona (TLA) the commercialization unit for the University. He molded a team that has cultivated original and cribbed from others leading university commercialization practice processes.  TLA has hand built an innovation ecosystem that leverages partners across the UA and the extended Arizona business and UA alumni communities.  His strategic planning approach which includes performance expectations is uncommon across universities.

Before coming to Arizona in 2012, Dave spent two decades leading technology commercialization programs at first Ohio University, then Ohio State University and then University of Colorado.  He is known in the field as a ‚Äúturn around guy‚Äù, transforming underperforming university technology transfer operations into key institutional assets. David N. Allen, Ph.D., began his leadership of Tech Launch Arizona in September 2012. He has over 30 years of experience in technology-related research, instruction and practice. Before coming to the University of Arizona, Dr. Allen served as the Associate Vice President (AVP) for Technology Transfer at the University of Colorado from February 2002 to August 2012. Prior to CU, he was an AVP at Ohio State (Columbus), Ohio University (Athens) and a professor at Penn State University (University Park).

He has brought an innovative and accelerated approach to the University of Arizona‚Äôs technology commercialization engine. Since his arrival, he has led the complete transformation of the UA‚Äôs former Office of Technology Transfer and the long-standing Office of University Research Parks into Tech Launch Arizona. He reports directly to UA President Robert C. Robbins.

""A controversial Republican political hopeful in Maine has ended his campaign following widespread outrage after he slandered Parkland shooting massacre survivor Emma Gonzalez as a ‚Äúskinhead lesbian‚Äù the Sun Journal reported Friday.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best thing for everybody,‚Äù Gibson said.

‚ÄúThere is nothing about this skinhead lesbian that impresses me and there is nothing that she has to say unless you‚Äôre a frothing at the mouth moonbat,‚Äù Gibson wrote on Twitter, before ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù his account.

Gibson also attacked Parkland student David Hogg as ‚Äúa bald faced liar‚Äù in another tweet. ‚ÄúHogg doesn‚Äôt get a pass when he blatantly lies.‚Äù

On Friday, having lost a such a public feud to two Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students, Gibson withdrew from the race.
‚ÄúI am not walking away with my head hung low,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúI am walking away with my head held high.‚Äù‚Äù*

Lyrics: 

She said
This is not about a poltergeist
Not about a phantom that glows at night
But there are things we don‚Äôt know and I
Don‚Äôt have another choice but an open mind / oh
And I know what they‚Äôll say
I‚Äôm trying to make sense of what no one can explain
But I‚Äôve been having dreams that after I‚Äôm awake
Play out in reality the very next day
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I‚Äôm wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side till the daylight comes

And when the lights go down
I see things I can‚Äôt explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts

This is not about you and me
I can‚Äôt bring back how it used to be
And I know what I do believe but
I‚Äôve already seen what I couldn‚Äôt see / oh
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I‚Äôm wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side till the daylight comes

And when the lights go down
I see things I can‚Äôt explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts

And when the lights go down
Is there something in the air
There but never there
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts

The petrol-electric performance SUV has become the first vehicle to climb the stairs to the natural rock arch of Heaven‚Äôs Gate.

The challenge began at the bottom of the legendary 11.3km Tianmen Mountain Road (known as the Dragon Road).  The showroom standard Range Rover Sport P400e took on the demanding course, with Panasonic Jaguar Racing‚Äôs Ho-Pin Tung behind the wheel and the Terrain Response 2 system in Dynamic mode.

At the summit of the road, the Formula E driver optimised Terrain Response for the second part of the challenge, conquering the towering 45-degree staircase of 999 steps leading to China‚Äôs legendary Heaven‚Äôs Gate using a combination of Ingenium petrol and electric battery power.

The new PHEV powertrain gives the Range Rover Sport a zero-emission EV range of up to 50km when fully charged but Ho-Pin Tung used its advanced 300PS Ingenium petrol engine and 116PS electric motor to make short work of the road section of the challenge. The performance SUV then showed its uncompromised all-terrain credentials by climbing the steep staircase to the natural rock arch.

Benedict Cumberbatch tries Kimbap for the first time, Pom Klementieff is mind blown by Korean pears, Tom Holland falls in love with Korean Banana Milk and Tom Hiddleston may have the smoothest voice in history. This week we have the privilege of filming with 4 members of the cast of Avengers Infinity War!!

With a busy schedule of press interviews in their hotel, we wanted to give them all a unique, fun Korean experience during their stay. So we put together a set and chose a variety of homely Korean food that we know foreigners love from our previous videos, that also fit the actors' dietary requirements. Kimbap from two of my favourite Kimbap joints in Seoul, the sort of Kimbap bursting with fillings and flavour, that makes me question how on earth Kimbap isn't known around the world. And fresh juicy Korean fruit that is unlike anything we have in the UK.

This is Avengers trying Korean food!

Do you know who Stephen Hawking is? During his life, this outstanding scientist and science popularizer made many discoveries and truly bold assumptions about the Universe. At the age of 20 Hawking began to show signs of a deadly disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. After discovering this condition, doctors thought the scientist wouldn't live more than two and a half years, but he was one tough lucky bastard. Instead of sinking into despair, Hawking set himself an amazing goal: to fully understand the universe. He was really stubborn at trying to achieve this goal throughout his life. Having lost the ability to walk and even speak, he continued to travel around the world, he met with a variety of people, he even appeared on the screen, and, of course, he never stopped his researches for a day. On March 14th, 2018, Steven Hawking passed away, but his scientific theories will keep intriguing the humanity for several decades. In today's video, we are gonna explain some of his most amazing theories",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KKyjkpFHPGk/sddefault.jpg,0.012313881586649495,0.0009298776101317636,13.242475625264944,0.00393315760656835,0.013243759196781259,0.01717691680334961,2018-03-28,18:03:41,Wednesday,2,8,51,8,38,55,369,0,62,0,0,7,2,2,7,6.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.939545665997794,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Arguably the most important figure in streetwear today, Abloh sat down with us for our DIARIES series to talk more in-depth on the current state of streetwear, comparing it to an art movement where ‚Äúessentially I‚Äôm just an assistant to the people that came before me trying to add to go forward for the next generation.‚Äù

The Off-White‚Ñ¢ designer and architect says, ‚Äúmore than anything I feel like I‚Äôm a descendant of everyone from Kanye West to Pharrell Williams to Basquiat or Warhol,‚Äù when asked about he labels himself. In terms of the bigger picture for streetwear, Virgil says he doesn‚Äôt want the larger fashion community and ecosystem to view it just as a trend that comes and goes ‚Äî streetwear as an art movement that inspires other industries hasn‚Äôt been realized yet but it has started to show. Most importantly, Abloh says it‚Äôs important for him to stay true to himself, wearing Jordans and a T-shirt to the Met Gala and playing Migos at his fashion show.

You can listen to the rest of the interview above and check out the full spread in Issue 20 of HYPEBEAST Magazine. Be sure to keep an eye peeled for our full Virgil Abloh documentary coming soon.

About Damon and Jo:

It‚Äôs Damon. It‚Äôs Jo. And It‚Äôs Damon and Jo. Ok so look, we got tired of all the boring, predictable lifestyle and travel content out there, so we took matters into our own hands and started filming our travels, and adventures around the globe, in 5+ languages.

In this video you will find out about top 10 highest paid models of 2019. Modeling is not an easy thing to do and for somebody who is not really interested in what models do ,I may not even be clear what these models do. Somebody may be wondering what they gain by walking on their toes as people watch them. Somebody like that may not even imagine that some of the models earn more than some of the famous people they know. However, not every model is lucky enough to collect these lots of money as it requires particular attributes to do that. All the same, here are the top 10 highest paid models in 2019.

The model must be able to grab every single opportunity they come across and know how to couple these opportunities with great deals. If the model does these two things in the right way then it may just open both doors and windows for cash to start flowing in. Stories have been told about some models who came from very humble backgrounds but latter become filthy rich just because of modeling. If you have a passion for modeling then I will definitely encourage you to follow your dream. It may not just end up being your full-time job but also well rewarding. I invite you to look at the top 10 highest paid models in the world 2019. These people are filthy rich!

Here is the list of Top 10 Highest paid models in the world 2019.

[Whee In(ÌúòÏù∏)]

After finishing the successful activities for the title track ‚ÄòStarry Night‚Äô of its mini album ‚ÄòYellow Flower‚Äô, MAMAMOO has been busy performing ‚ÄòEveryday‚Äô in the first half of this year as they came to the fans like a present. This time, the third sister of MAMAMOO Whee In starts her first step as a solo artist. The title track ‚ÄòEASY‚Äô captivated the listeners as it well described Whee In‚Äôs deeper world of music that goes well with the multicolor glamour as if magnolias are in full bloom for the first time. Many have high expectations and attention in her future moves as she developed herself as a solo artist.

As another year reaches its closure, we remember and honor the pop culture, the music, the stars, the good and the bad times of 2017. Thank you  for being so supportive of my work and my progress through remixing and DJing the last 10 years. Through blocked YouTube channels and disabled social media profiles, i always keep connected with you because of the music,
and a dream that keeps coming true..
Everytime i work on a PopLove mix, it starts a bit like ""Oh no, we had boring music this year..."" but it ends like ""Wow this is a celebration!! Why didnt i notice this earlier?!!""""
The music was not very high-energy this year, as ballads are making a comeback, but i tried my best to have a powerful mix, even with most songs being mid-tempo.
Its something about pop melodies that gets you hooked and hopeful. As cold as the industry often feels right now, lets re-discover the melodies and remember what music is all about, no matter the genre. THE FEELS.

The Last Jedi has been a hit with critics and at the box office, earning rave reviews that have declared the film the best entry in the franchise since Empire Strikes Back. It also scored the second highest opening of all time (behind The Force Awakens), raking in $220 million at the box office in its first weekend. 

Still, in spite of that, the film has proved divisive online among fans, with many railing against the film‚Äôs depiction of Luke Skywalker, aspects of the Force, and other subplots. Many have chalked up the polarizing response to internet trolls, particularly racism and sexism against a film that displays a wide range of female leadership and heroic actions from a diverse cast.

 ‚ÄúThe goal is never to divide or make people upset, but I do think the conversations that are happening were going to have to happen at some point if sw is going to grow, move forward, and stay vital.‚Äù

In ‚ÄúStar Wars: The Last Jedi,‚Äù Kylo Ren reveals the truth about Rey‚Äôs parents. 
Apparently, he found out who her parents were when he was telepathically connected to Rey courtesy of the Force, and in an effort to persuade her to join him, he tells Rey what she knew all along: Her parents were just some junk-trading bums who sold her and are now dead in a ditch.
That‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no fancy history. No birthright. No need for in-depth analysis of fan theories. Rey is just plain old Rey.

Some fans are still questioning Rey‚Äôs parentage, especially since the news was delivered via Kylo Ren. Like Johnson said, it‚Äôs possible that Kylo is looking for any information, true or not, he can use as ‚Äúleverage‚Äù against Rey. 

 The truth might depend on how you look at things. ‚ÄúWith all of these movies, Obi-Wan‚Äôs whole speech about a certain point of view always applies, so I think that you have to always think about the context of how information is given. But for me, dramatically, that‚Äôs why that reveal at that moment made sense,‚Äù Johnson said.

‚ÄúAnything‚Äôs still open, and I‚Äôm not writing the next film. [J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio] are doing it,‚Äù he said.

Oprah Winfrey is so universally beloved that after her blockbuster acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in January 2018, there was speculation that she might actually run for President of the United States. That said, not everyone is a fan. Whether these hard feelings are behind them or not, at one point, the following celebs couldn't stand Winfrey...

Why did they have to give an origin to everything Han Solo has ever done? Step inside the pitch meeting that started it all. It‚Äôs super easy, barely an inconvenience.

After having Norwegian Olympic Skiers Andreas and Bastion on our show to try Korean drinks, we decide to take them out to a very traditional Korean food market near PyeongChang. Andreas especially survives off a diet of Fries and Salad at home, and so we were very curious to see what he thought about some of local market's specialties: from deep fried fish cakes and crispy Korean fried chicken to red bean filled fish pancakes and even silk worm larvae!? Watch to the end to see if we manage to persuade them of the value of being adventurous and trying new things! Enjoy!!

Rian Johnson and Mark Hamill Discuss Star Wars: The Last Jedi Backlash

Star Wars the Last Jedi is making a killing at the box office, but that doesn't mean everyone's happy with it. A vocal contingent of fans and journalists have been expressing their displeasure with storyline choices online, and the audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes is a lot lower than the critics rating.

So what gives?

Well, Disney and people involved with the film have responded to unhappiness in articles and videos. In this video, I highlight a few comments from writer-director Rian Johnson, Mr. Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, and a Disney executive.

This looks to be confirmation that Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man/Peter Parker will be appearing in ‚ÄòVenom‚Äô. How big might his role be in the film? Does this also mean that he will also be in the Sinister Six movie or the Silver and Black movie? Also, will we see any other MCU heroes/villains cross over into any of the Sony Spiderverse movies? And might there be a scene or two with Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider-man in ‚ÄòAvengers: Infinity War‚Äô that might lead us into ‚ÄòVenom‚Äô?

Jon Schnepp sits down with Mark Reilly to give you the answer to all these questions and offer some speculation on what Holland‚Äôs appearance might mean going forward.

It is basically just a few ingredients! We used the recipe over at https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2013/06/05/dole-whip-recipe-bring-disney-to-your-kitchen/ which turned out to be fairly spot on! For the churros we found an official Disney recipe on the Disney Parks Blog here: https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2017/12/disney-parks-churro-palooza/ This recipe sounds hard, but actually turned out to be fairly easy to do! We finished up the Disney day by watching the movie UP which Jenn had not seen yet. She cried the whole movie! Join us tomorrow for an all new video!

Before you eat another cookie or drink another glass of wine, think about how it will reflect on your looks.
""You are what you eat,"" - they say. You have probably heard this expression many times. But do you take it into consideration when you choose what to cook for lunch or what to drink with your dinner?

SUMMARY
- Apart from large amounts of sugar, wine sometimes contains pesticides and sulfides, causing alcohol to dehydrate you. Your body loses water, your liver is overloaded, and your digestion may fail the next day, so your skin will look wrinkly, red, and hanging. In the long run, alcohol abuse may disrupt the work of bowel bacteria and cause various diseases.
- This problem can appear even if you don't consume milk glass after glass every day. Milk added to your coffee or another bowl of ice cream may seriously affect your facial skin color, even if you aren't lactose intolerant. We lose a lot of lactose-metabolizing enzymes with age, and it provokes inflammations all over the body, including the face. The scheme is the following: cow milk contains a hormone with the name IGF-1. 
- Sugar affects not only your weight but your skin as well. It accelerates glycation, the process in which excess glucose molecules link with collagen, damaging it and making it rigid. This makes your skin age faster, causes wrinkles to appear, and disrupts pigmentation. 
- Gluten has the unfortunate ability to make your intestines so to say ""leaky"". It means that they start to let undigested particles of food enter your bloodstream. As soon as it happens, the body gets alarmed and an immune response is provoked into action. It causes an inflammation of such skin conditions as acne. Check if you have gluten intolerability by excluding the products containing it for 2-3 weeks and watching your skin.
- Cinnamon has similar qualities. Its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties help to reduce acne and the scars left after it. Apple cider vinegar unclogs skin pores. Also, it successfully dissolves the cells of the dead skin. It restores the normal pH of the skin and makes the appearance of pores minimal. 

How do you deal with the problems appearing on your face? Do you use any of the masks we have told you about?

(without your mom yelling at you)

Lots of research are arising from the fairly unexplored world of automative communications. Cars are no longer becoming computers, they are fully connected networks where every ECU exchanges and operates the vehicles at some point.
Here is an introduction of my immersion and discussions with my car, and how I finally managed to drift (a bit) with my mom's FWD Fiat 500c.

This talk is not only about security, but about hacking and video games. Many video games are about driving cars, whether it is for racing, or heisting and escaping the police. In this talk, we will explain how the user experience could actually be improved by connecting a car to a video game and turning it into a game controller.

We will discuss about these connected systems, how car components interact with one another, the different protocols, or anything that came to us during this journey.

However there was one important constraint during all that experience: no car could be dismantled nor modified. The main goal of this analysis was to try doing something out of the data which could be freely recovered while plugging itself to the OBD-II port of a car. As mentioned, this resulted in the possibility of controlling a video game car through the real car, like a simulator, without the need of modifying anything in the car itself.

Unfortunately, this requires a lot of gasoline to have the engine powered on and run. Moreover, gasoline is really expensive in France. So we looked for a way to reduce that cost. We actually found a nice device on the Internet to optimize the amount of gasoline used by the engine. Apparently, it works by connecting to the OBD-II port and reconfigures the engine‚Äôs ECU. We looked into that to understand what was actually going on‚Ä¶ and try to reduce the cost of the drifting.

The following points will be mentioned during the presentation:
ECUs
CAN bus
OBD-II (DTCs/PIDs)
On-top-of-CAN protocols
UDS (Diagnostic/Security session)
Reverse engineering: the meanings of CAN messages
Using a real car as a simulator, for poories
Minor details about how to create a custom game controller

The British national anthem.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle leave the chapel as husband and wife. 

Hundreds of guests watched the couple exchange vows in a #ceremony at St. George's chapel featuring a gospel choir and an American preacher.  And the #kiss the #RoyalWedding crowds had waited for.

American Bishop Michael Curry captured the world's attention with a long and powerful address.

'Stand by Me' was performed by Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been declared husband and wife, following a ceremony at Windsor Castle. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel.

Following their marriage, the couple will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

Those Game 2's raised some interesting questions: What does it mean that the Cavs eked out a three-point win at home despite LeBron going off for 46 points, 12 rebounds, 5 assists, and 2 steals? How many fire emojis should Russell Westbrook's tux look get in ""Fire Fit""? With Karl-Anthony Towns scoring a total of 13 points in two L's to start his playoff career, what the hell is going on with KAT? Looking forward to tonight's playoff Game 3's, OOB has some more questions: Will Kevin Hart's trash talk keep 36-year-old Dwyane Wade cooking in Miami? Is the All-Star Damian Lillard we know and love finally going to show up against New Orleans? After coach Gregg Popovich's wife, Erin, passed away yesterday, can the overmatched Spurs pull out a win for them against the Warriors? Only time will tell. The same can be said of whether Tom Brady will retire or play QB for the Patriots in 2018. In ""The Step-Back,"" OOB discusses whether an ESPN story about Brady having not committed to play yet is a legit story or just click-bait. Finally, following a report that ""handlers"" for standout Penn State running back Saquon Barkley don't want the Browns to draft him, in ""Fair or Foul?"" the guys weigh in on players forcing undesirable teams to not draft them.

I decided to use a few of them to make a new coffee table for my living room.  I was limited by the lengths of timber and came up with this design that gave me a really chunky looking table while minimizing the waste.  I wish the table could have been a little wider, but overall I am happy with the design and it looks great in place.  Estimated weight of the table is 175 pounds.

The wood is douglas fir and it was destined for the fire pit.  These are leftovers from a new building that was constructed at a nearby ski hill.

I cut the timbers to length using a beam saw from my friends at Windsor Plywood Sherwood Park.  If you're local, check them out!https://www.windsorplywood.com/location/sherwood-park/
Thanks Colin!

I got the sides of the pieces parallel to each other with some hand planing.  They're not perfectly square, but them butt up to each other quite nicely.  I then drilled some 3/8"" holes to accept some dowels for alignment while gluing.  There is so much surface area for the glue that the dowels aren't needed for strength.   I drilled all the way through one board into the board under it so the pins would be perfectly aligned and you can't see them from the outside edges.

Anywhere that there was a check (crack) I stabilized it with a Dutchman (bowtie).  I used my X-Carve to cut out a template and the Dutchmen.  I roughed out the holes with a flush trim bit in a router and squared the corners with some chisel work.  All checks, top and bottom, were stabilized so this thing is solid now!.  The Dutchmen are made out of cherry.

I smoothed the top and sides a little.  Not too much since I wanted a unique look.  Then I flipped the top over, marked out where the base would sit and routed a shallow socket so the top/ base can mate up and not slide around.

After a lot of sanding to get everything smooth and reduce the risk of splinters I applied 3 coats of General Finishes Arm-R-Seal.  It's an oil based finish that stinks to high heaven and looks amazing.  I will also apply a little Briwax in a month or so once the finish is completly cured.

I can barely lift the top by myself so I don't have any fears of it floating away.  It's just held in place by the pull of the earths gravity.

In this video we compare and contrast Andre the Giant with the World's Tallest Man, the Alton Giant Robert Wadlow.  Would you have liked to see Wadlow in the ring?  Leave a comment below! 

After graduating high school, Robert went on tour with the Ringling Brothers Circus, and later crisscrossed the country to promote the International Shoe Company, which graciously provided Robert‚Äôs size 37AA footwear.

Wadlow suffered from weakness and lack of sensation in his legs and feet, and as he grew he required leg braces and a cane to walk.

In 1940, a faulty brace rubbing against his ankle caused a blister, which became badly infected. On July 15, 1940, Robert passed away at the age of 22. Eighteen days earlier, doctors had measured his height at 8 feet, 11.1 inches.

Robert's body was returned to his hometown and buried in a 1,000-pound casket which was carried by a dozen pallbearers and eight assistants. A life-sized bronze statue honoring him still stands in Alton.

KZ-n4gE9GNA,ALXiloyym0M,DIY: Poor Man's Fiberglass - Step-by-Step!,RuggedHomestead,26.0,2018-01-28 12:00:01+00:00,"['diy', ""poor man's fiberglass"", 'how-to', 'homestead', 'tonneau']",294936.0,4087.0,367.0,459.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KZ-n4gE9GNA/default.jpg,"Fiberglass is a tough, durable, and weather-resistant product, but it can be expensive and messy to work with. A more affordable option is what's called ""poor man's fiberglass"" and in this video I take you step-by-step through the process of using it.

I'm making a tonneau cover for my pickup truck -- a hard cover that covers the bed. It protects what you store under it from the elements and from thieves. While there are commercial tonneau covers on the market, they can run from the hundreds of dollars to the thousands. I'm building one from some materials I have around the homestead and using the ""poor man's fiberglass"" to make it durable and waterproof.

To make poor man's fiberglass you'll need fabric, Titebond II glue, and exterior grade paint. That's it! 

Using a wood base (I'm using several folding tables I had laying around), you paint on a layer of glue and lay your fabric over the top, smoothing it out so it adheres to the glue and wood. You then coat the top of the fabric -- I'm using a canvas drop cloth from Harbor Freight Tools -- with another layer of glue. 

Once that coat dries, you sand it lightly and then apply a second coat of glue over the top. When it dries, sand it again. Now you're ready for the paint. Apply two coats of paint to the wood, sanding in between, and then finish with several coats of polyurethane.

You will have a waterproof surface that's tough and impervious to the elements. Poor man's fiberglass is as simple as that!

Mine is finished slightly differently because of the application I'm using it for. Instead of polyurethane I used truck bed liner ""paint"" to finish it off. But the concept is the same.

People use this technique for all types of projects, from building campers to boats. My tonneau cover ended up costing me about $75, but that's because the bed truck liner paint alone runs $40. That's a big savings to the $100s or $1000s of dollars a commercial grade one would cost. Maybe not as pretty as that, but it serves my needs perfectly!

Where can you use poor man's fiberglass around your homestead?

Last time, Stephen gave a room tour of his bedroom and inside Stephens bedroom he went into his brothers room. After exploring some secret rooms in Carter‚Äôs closet, they found one tiny trapped door that was super haunted and Stephen went into it. Steven was only in that haunted room a few moments before a scary animal or haunted creature flew behind his head!! So today Stephen went back into his brothers secret haunted room but this time it was a 3am challenge!! Everything was going smoothly until it started getting closer to 3am. Then Stephen left the room to go get scissors to open some of the suspicious box fort boxes and when he came back, the door to the secret room was closed and locked‚Ä¶.this 3am challenge was scary!

Today we take Sho and Andy for the second installment in our MUST TRY KOREA guide. And after trying all of that incredible Korean fried Chicken, the next stop had to be Korean BBQ. But as you'll find in Korea, there are so many different types that it's hard to know where to start.

So today we break it down to the basics, and go to an incredible Korean Pork specialist, followed by an amazing Korean Beef specialist. We try 3 types of pork BBQ and 2 types of beef BBQ, for as complete of an experience as is physically possible in one day!! What will they choose as their foreigners favourite Korean BBQ?!

Kbvj_EuiKQY,V4dqF7UOspg,Why Shaq Never Tried The Underhand Free Throw,Business Insider,17.0,2018-01-09 00:00:01+00:00,"['Business Insider', ""Shaquille O'Neal"", 'Shaq', 'NBA', 'Basketball', 'Free throws', 'Shots', 'Sports', 'Percentage', 'Success']",143073.0,1484.0,70.0,82.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kbvj_EuiKQY/default.jpg,"Shaquille O'Neal has a career 52.7% free throw percentage. Some say Shaq could have vastly improved his percentage by shooting underhand or ""granny style.""

Rick Barry did it, and he wound up the 4th best free throw shooter in NBA history. Even legend Wilt Chamberlain did it for the 1961-62 season, and his percentage improved by 10%.

We asked Shaq why he refused to shoot underhand, and it turns out he isn't sold on the technique. Following¬†is¬†a transcript¬†of the video.

Shaquille O'Neal: Because it‚Äôs boring.

Business Insider: But it‚Äôs been proven to be somewhat effective.

O'Neal: No, it‚Äôs not. It's not proven. Just 'cause a couple guys did it doesn't mean anybody can do it.

Rick Barry swore by it and is the fourth best free throw shooter in NBA history.

I told Rick Barry I‚Äôd rather shoot 0% than shoot underhand. I'm too cool for that.

The underhand free throw creates¬†a softer shot and is easy to repeat. Overhand free throws spin twice on the way to the basket. Underhand shots tend to spin 3 to 4 times. The extra spin helps shots that hit the rim. Even basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain shot ""granny style"" during the 1961-62 season. His free throw percentage rose by 10.9%

I think it was the man upstairs‚Äô way to just keep me humble. ‚ÄòCause imagine me with the game that I had, shooting like Steph Curry from the free throw line. I‚Äôd probably be a difficult man to deal with because in my mind I would know that I‚Äôm the best player ever created.

Better than Mike, better than Wilt ... so it was just a way to keep me humble. But when it came time to really buckle down and concentrate and you got a whole crowd doubting you and the whole crowd supporting, I always knock ‚Äòem down.

Shaq's low free throw percentage led to the ""Hack-a-Shaq"" strategy, intentionally fouling players with low free-throw percentages.

BI:¬†How‚Äôs your free throw these days?

O'Neal: I haven‚Äôt shot in about four years. I‚Äôm retired.

So like many others, I was very disappointed by The Last Jedi and was overwhelmed by the number of questions from friends and family so I film this video review of my view on it that way I could answer everyone's questions at once. This review does not cover everything in the movie and apologize for that but it does cover the main points that I was asked about the most.  Like I say in the video if there was something I did not talk about that you would like me to cover let me know and we can talk about it. I'd be more than happy to post another video or speak to you directly. 

On another note, I filmed this in my studio shortly after seeing the movie for the second time and am just posting this now because I loathe the video editing process so Arthur because of our shared love for music and your sincerest message reaching out to me about my review on the film I've pushed my procrastination aside so you can have the answers to your questions. 

Enjoy everyone

DW‚Äôs Alexandra von Nahmen spent a year covering the Trump administration to find out more.

""Fake news"" is the battle cry of US President Donald Trump when he confronts critical reporters. Trump supporters often claim that journalists, including DW‚Äôs correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen, are ""liars."" She has been covering the Trump administration for a year now. In this report, she offers an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at Washington politics and the media.  In his tweets and speeches, the president encourages his political base to call out reporters whose coverage of him and his policies is less than favorable. This conflict with the media continues to characterize the Trump administration -- and has sharpened the political divisions in the United States. Alexandra von Nahmen is a member of the White House press corps, and has covered the president for a year now. She's accompanied him on foreign visits, and has attended his political rallies in the American heartland. In this report, she talks to both Trump supporters and opponents, and to media experts and journalists - including the Washington bureau chief at the prestigious New York Times, a young reporter for the conservative website ""The Daily Caller,"" and the White House correspondent for Playboy Magazine. Von Nahmen explores a question that a lot of people in the US and around the world are asking right now: ""Does Donald Trump pose a threat to press freedom?"" -- and by extension, a threat to democracy?

To investigate how audiobooks are made, we sat down with a professional audiobook narrator, Suzy Jackson, to break down her work. And to make the audiobook recording process even more apparent, Vox's Phil Edwards wrote one for her. According to Suzy Jackson, the hardest part of recording an audiobook isn't acting as different characters, it's the long hours. And random esophageal noises.

We uncovered an extraordinary tale of one American family‚Äôs journey from a comfortable life in Indiana to Raqqa, the bombed-out capital of the Islamic State, and ultimately into Kurdish detention.
 
Sam El Hassani, an American, says that her husband took the family to Turkey in 2015. She says he then forced her and the children over the Syrian border to join ISIS.

Book Recommendation - Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins

Hey guys! I wanted to try out the new Benefit Badgal Bang Mascara and while I was in the middle of getting ready to film I saw the same claims on my Maybelline Total Temptation Mascara. I also let you know whether or not I feel that other influencers are being honest with you after their sponsored trips. 

I feel I didn't get my point across super well in this video because I wanted to let you guys know - they may be a bit swayed from their lavish vacations, but from all of the other influencers that I have met and spoken with, thats not the case. I know for myself, I am going on a brand trip soon and there is NO obligation to speak positively of the products, and no obligation to give positive reviews. I think the look of the product speaks for itself, and for myself - watch to see my results. Did it blow my mind? eh - its a mascara. But did it disapoint me? No. I think when it comes to trusting influencers, its all about your gut feeling - if you don't feel that their trip can make them unbiased, that is totally understandable BUT brands do not expect only positive reviews afterwards, and typically always respect our opinions on their products whether they were give to us free or not.

proposal, we think we're too young)! We've been dating for almost four years now and I've been bugging him for a new ring. I hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog, I'm super proud of it. If you're reading this comment, ""If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it."" Only we will know hehe.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KeJx_Thugos/sddefault.jpg,0.0213761261113818,0.00017769015886435414,120.3,0.0006134986537632437,0.021553816270246155,0.0221673149240094,2018-04-26,08:35:00,Thursday,3,7,37,7,32,40,329,0,76,0,1,7,16,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.516180209621174,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes 'cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

This is touted as the number one fresh pasta maker in Italy, although most people there, just like elsewhere, prefer to buy dried pasta.  You can buy a heck of a lot of bags of dried pasta for the price of this machine, so it‚Äôs definitely not a way to save money, it probably makes a better gift than it does an investment. 
Unlike most kitchen gadgets I‚Äôve tested, this is one I will be using again. It‚Äôs surprisingly fun, it works well, there's something special about eating pasta you've just made and the cost of using it is negligible. 

Unfortunately the place I bought mine from (Coolshop) no longer stock  them - but according to the Philips website it is now being sold officially in the U.K. for ¬£170

It's pretty simple to make flavoured pasta - e.g. To make carrot flavoured pasta you replace the water in the mixture with carrot juice...and the same goes for Tomato etc.



UPDATES
1 - According to the Philips Website the machine should also now be available in the U.K. (when I bought mine in November 2017 it wasn‚Äôt). Although I can‚Äôt find anywhere with any stock.
2) - The toy I mentioned was not from Playmobil - it was the Playdoh mop top hair shop
3) I pronounced penne incorrectly a couple of times in this video. That‚Äôs how my family always pronounced it - although to be honest I don't think it's a word we said very much. You'll also notice that I also pronounce it correctly once in the video. However this slight difference in pronunciation seems to have people rioting in the streets. I know it‚Äôs difficult, but please try to get past this horrendous and awfully upsetting event - I'm working on arranging counselling sessions for all the affected people. It is a deeply shocking and sobering event for us all, may god have mercy on my soul. 
4) Very few people read this box or the pinned comment, so expect lots of comments repeating the things above.

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Did Lorde SHADE Pink after her Grammy performance?! Find out why Lorde‚Äôs getting called OUT on social media.

This is why you ALWAYS gotta be reaction-ready for the camera at an awards show.

Pink gave a powerful and impassioned performance of her hit song, ‚ÄúWild Hearts Can‚Äôt Be Broken‚Äù at this year‚Äôs Grammy awards, and just in case you missed here, here‚Äôs a little taste:

Yeah, that‚Äôs what you call GIVING IT YOUR ALL, PEOPLE! While Pink was given a huge round of applause for her breathtaking rendition of the song, one member of the crowd who seemed to be less than impressed by Pink was Lorde. The ‚ÄúGreen Light‚Äù singer was caught giving barely a golf clap after Pink ended her performance, and that is NOT an exaggeration.

Lorde was immediately CALLED OUT by fans on Twitter, with one posting QUOTE, ‚Äú@lorde ‚Äòs expression after @Pink performance??? WTH?? Baby claps?? Is there some sort of beef here I don‚Äôt know about?? #grammys‚Äù and another writing QUOTE, ‚ÄúLorde has no time for Pink #GRAMMYs‚Äù. Many others took to the app to question what the deal with Lorde‚Äôs reaction to Pink was, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like anybody has a logical explanation. One fan called out the incident as QUOTE, ‚Äúwhite on white crime‚Äù and frankly I‚Äôm gonna have to agree with them. Lorde--what is your deal woman?!

Maybe Lorde wasn‚Äôt as enthusiastic about Pink killing it because she was still bummed about not getting a solo Grammy performance, herself. It was reported that Lorde refused to perform at the Grammys after she wasn't offered a solo performance, unlike her fellow male nominees. Of course, that‚Äôs still no excuse for that miniature golf clap so WHAT GIVES, LORDE?!

How about you guys--what do you make of Lorde shading Pink with that limp-as-all-hell clap? Let me hear your thoughts and theories in the comments below, and after that click right over here to see all the best moments from the awards show. Thanks so much for joining me on News Feed, and be sure to subscribe for more award season coverage! I‚Äôm your girl Drew Dorse and I‚Äôll see you next time!

Lyrics:
You don't love her but you say so
It's alright we all got things we don't know
I don't even mind
'Cuz I like being by your side

I'll be waiting I'll be patient
Till you find your favorite location
Perfectly designed
For a love to be oh so blind

We'll be falling hard in the black hole
Of our universe..
And the whole world is ours..
But we wont' know - cuz we're too busy loving love

Eyeyey we're too busy loving love uh
Eyeyey cuz we're too busy loving love
Eyeyey we're too busy loving love uh

Don't listen to what they say
There shouldn't be just one type of way
Traditional old rules
Only lock up the perfect jewels

Show your feelings say it loud:
I love someone so much damn I'm proud
We're anciently new school
Loving love like we're supposed to

Naaz is a 21-year-old singer-songwriter and producer from Holland, who immediately captures your attention with her distinctive voice. Having a Kurdish background, it took Naaz quite some time and effort to convince her family to allow her to follow her passion. During that time, Naaz taught herself to write, produce and record her own music in her bedroom, so she could still be able to make music regardless of any circumstances. Together with producers of Soulsearchin' she finishes her bedroom born music so that her quirky, playful yet subtle productions go hand in hand with her melodic songwriting.

And the most awkward moment of the night award goes to Hugh Jackman.

This episode is brought to you by Turbo Tax. Relax, there‚Äôs Turbo Tax.

you would think by now these actors would know that they‚Äôre constantly being recorded at theses awards shows‚Ä¶but nope.

Cameras or not sometimes you just can‚Äôt hold in your emotions and Hugh Jackman knows that all too well. Tonight at the 75th annual Golden Globes the greatest showman actor just could not hide the look on his face when James Franco won best actor in a motion picture over him.

James Franco took the stage to accept his award for his movie The Disaster Artist and brought his brother Dave and The Room director Tommy Wiseau onto stage. The speech started off pretty rocky when Tommy was elbowed away from the podium when he tried to grab the mic off his pal and make a speech himself.

Believe it or not that wasn‚Äôt the most awkward part of the night. The uncomfortable moment came shortly after Franco thanked his fellow nominees and the camera landed on Hugh‚Äôs face‚Ä¶.

Was he confused by the win or the dramatic speech, who knows lets check to see what twitter has to say about it.
https://twitter.com/KateBennett_DC/status/950189224250224643
one twitter users posted a clip saying ‚ÄúHugh Jackman‚Äôs face realizing he just lost to this guy

https://twitter.com/yeahvictoriaaa_/status/950188869932146689
while another wrote ‚ÄúHugh Jackman embodies everyone right now during James Franco‚Äôs acceptance speech.

Looks like twitter isn‚Äôt sure either. So I‚Äôm going to need your help. Let me know in the comments below do you think Hugh Jackman was shocked that James won the award over him or could he just not keep up with the thrilling speech? Either way you have to admit his face was definitely priceless and meme worthy. Thank you in advance for helping me out in the comments make sure you like this video and subscribe before you go. I‚Äôm your host Jackie Iadonisi thanks for tuning in.

If you tried to explain the logic behind driving four hours to ride a one-minute time trial up Monsal Head to an Italian they would surely think you a little special. I decided to throw myself into this years hill-climbing season - I wanted to immerse myself in this cycling sub culture and find out what the appeal is. For many people, the idea of turning yourself inside out with a lung busting effort, up a brutally steep climb in typical autumnal British weather at 9am on a Sunday is far removed from what constitutes 'fun.' I also wanted to explore it takes to succeed in these short but intense events. If I stopped eating cake, got a mega light bike and trained like a pro, could I go from zero to hero? Probably not, but I thought I would give it a go anyway!

The Death of Stalin could‚Äôve been a lot better.  It is a strange form of parody or dark comedy.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if it could be saved with a bit better historicism.  It did have me laughing at a few points.  Some of the license taken is necessary, but there are some dangerous misconceptions and falsehoods this movie proliferates.  They needed to take greater care with such a touchy subject.

edit: sorry about the intro saying Week 1 i can't believe i didnt catch that TT__TT

Hey U! Have you watched Vlogmas Week 1 yet? üéÖ http://youtu.be/u_c37Pjpu2s

Sorry I wasn't able to get this up yesterday! The file was quite large and I've been editing a few videos at the same time so my laptop ran out of storage ÔºàÔΩâ–îÔΩâÔºâI had to delete 27 GB of files last night 

Oh and about the FCC Net Neutrality thing, I didn't realize Youtube restricts what links you can put up as cards so I'll just leave some links here http://bit.ly/1nEO2Zq http://bit.ly/2l6zvwd

I know I don't really show you guys much in my vlogs lol but I really wanted to do vlogmas this year because it's nearing January 3rd (which is when I uploaded my first video) and I don't think you can really see who I am in my videos so I just wanted to do vlogmas as a fun way to show u a bit more of me behind the makeup!

+ a new makeup tutorial IS going up soon so please look forward to that!

Friday Morning is a love song, written and recorded at the remote farm in Burton, Texas where Khruangbin got its start. To commemorate the song, the band asked their closest friends and family to record messages of love to each band member. The music video is a portrait of the band hearing these audio recordings for the first time, capturing on film the emotions one feels when they hear just how loved they are; a poignant and heartfelt expression in a time where, as a collective whole, we need to hear and express love more than ever.

This video was initially around a minute longer, and most of what I talked about was:

1. How that comment about interviewing sidewalks weirdly made me see the world in a different way.

2. A little more about making things with the understanding that they are bigger than you and your life and that that is the most rewarding way I have found to experience creation.

3. A little about the history of Missoula, which tripled in population between 1900 and 1910, which is why a lot of sidewalks were laid down in the 1910s and 1920s.

4. A little about how Missoula treats these maker stamps. Everyone sorta unanimously tries to protect them, so you'll walk around and entire sidewalks will have been replaced, but the one square that has the makers stamp will have been left, even if it's a little cruddy and eroded and cracked. Sometimes, when they have to be replaced, people will even cut the stamp out and sink it in the ground next to the sidewalk.

What is ASMR? Here‚Äôs my definition: https://youtu.be/qAEM95ixp-s

Remember!
ASMR is not a medical treatment. ASMR is meant to induce tingles, relaxation, and sleep. Although it may make you feel better, it has not been proven to fix any mental health issues or conditions you may have. If you need help, PLEASE seek a professional. Here are a few links that can help you:

If you‚Äôve ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to be a rich kid in Singapore, we‚Äôre about to give you the lowdown. This city-state is home to 5.6 million people, so it‚Äôs no surprise that some of its citizens are a part of the millionaire and the billionaire clubs. They have shared their wealth with their families, including their kids and grandkids. We‚Äôre going to focus on the younger generation and show you how they spend thousands of dollars in Las Vegas and just how much they pay to fly in first-class on Singapore Airlines. This is: Inside The Lives Of The Rich Kids Of Singapore.

Some of the most prominent rich kids who love to show off their affluent lifestyles on social media are Kim Lim, Dhillon Lee, and Kane Lim. We‚Äôll show you photos of their luxury Cadillac Escalades and Lamborghinis, as well as photos from their travels across the globe.

We‚Äôll also be showing you the affluent communities these rich kids call home, including Sentosa Cove, and the super popular but pricey Good Class Bungalows. These rich kids aren‚Äôt spending all of their time at home, of course. When they feel like getting outside of the house, they usually head over to ION Orchard mall to shop at some of its luxury boutiques, including Louis Vuitton.

If you‚Äôd like to hear even more about how the rich kids of Singapore live, make sure to watch our video. Let us know in the comments section which aspect of the rich kids of Singapore‚Äôs lives shocked you the most, and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to TheTalko!

Lyrics:

pray

light the fire of our hope
we are the shelter
break the chains that hold
a deeper meaning
is what we long to find
join the alliance 
leave the slave behind

break the silence
'cause we are one
we are the alliance
'cause we are one

we carry on 
with the work of the henchmen
soulless dividing
the sheep from the wolves
protecting and serving
our own god
from the void into their eyes
he has arrived
unify and stand together
we won't be denied

break the silence
'cause we are one
we are the alliance
'cause we are one

upon the final day we have come together
a million souls stand as one
prepare to arise
arise

break the silence
'cause we are one
we are the alliance
'cause we are one",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kn07wMzOd5I/sddefault.jpg,0.01796006188207063,0.0003131307181234479,57.356435643564346,0.0012029180062564134,0.018273192600194086,0.019476110606450492,2018-01-11,06:18:59,Thursday,3,5,57,5,56,34,555,3,124,4,0,0,25,1,1,6.0,9.0,"['a a', '', 'i UA']","['a', 'a', 'i', 'UA']",True,"['a', 'a', 'i', 'UA']",4,3,5,0,1,0,3,4.8815422241115485,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Continue learning at this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos

Lots of people find mathematical equations intimidating because they don't make sense. But they are not hard to understand if you follow a few steps, anyone can learn to read them. And it is well worth it because they are so incredibly useful to describe everything in math and physics. If you already know I'm sure you know someone who might like this video, I'm going to send it to my family who are less mathematically inclined than me.

The steps you need to know are: 1. Find the variables, 2. Work out what all of the different mathematical symbols mean, 3. Wok out what order you would perform the mathematical operations if you were going to plug numbers in to the equations. These steps really help you get your head around what an equation is telling you. Also, don't be scared about the greek letters, they do just the same thing as normal letters, they either represent constants or variables.

This video contains a paid promotion for the game ""Vikings: War Of Clans"". 

We always wanted to learn more about sword fighting techniques. ""Vikings - War Of Clans"" was generous enough to finance our trip to the North, where we met two of the most dangerous blade experts in the whole of Germany... 

It is a very different episode here on The Slingshot Channel, but we extremely enjoyed this excursion. Plus we learned a lot!

Infinity War is the first part in a two-part culmination and ‚Äúfinale‚Äù to the MCU as we know it and will land in theatres on May 4th, 2018.

The National Board of Review has announced honorees for its 2017 awards.

After allegations of abuse by Johnny Depp against Amber Heard that led to a very famous and public divorce, many have been calling for the character he plays in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, that of the dark wizard Grindelwald, to be recast. Now, speaking with EW about the sequel Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Yates has come to Depp‚Äôs defense, explaining why the role won‚Äôt be recast.

20th Century Fox has released the first Love, Simon trailer. Based on Becky Albertalli‚Äôs novel, the film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier, played by Nick Robinson, who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that he‚Äôs gay. He‚Äôs also working to identify an anonymous classmate he‚Äôs fallen for online.

Variety reports that a new movie featuring Daphne and Velma, the teen-girl sleuths from ‚ÄúScooby-Doo,‚Äù are getting their own origin story in a live-action feature-length film from Jennifer and Ashley Tisdale‚Äôs production banner Blondie Girl Productions.

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.

‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J. Miller (‚ÄúDeadpool,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), with Simon Pegg (the ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù movies, the ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù ‚ÄúDunkirk‚Äù).

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù) reunited his creative team from ‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (‚ÄúThe Grand Budapest Hotel‚Äù), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan,‚Äù ‚ÄúRaiders of the Lost Ark‚Äù) and Sarah Broshar (‚ÄúThe Post‚Äù), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (‚ÄúMoonrise Kingdom‚Äù).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù films, ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù).

Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, ‚ÄúReady Player One.‚Äù

Slated for release in March 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros.

We have heard many theories such as Rey is a kenobi..Rey Kenobi or Supreme Leader Snoke is a whill, or perhaps even Kylo Ren is a double agent the theories of all been very interesting, but it seems the big stuff has not even been nailed yet!. I know snokes identity and Rey identity were big ones being discussed as well. Its going to be so great to see what the big shocks and twists will really be in this movie!.

Here are 10 extremely difficult choices you will ever have to make! Throughout our lives, we are constantly bombarded with major choices. Our decisions determine your future and define you and shape your personality. In this video, Bright Side offers you to make 10 extremely difficult choices. At the end of the video, we‚Äôll tell what kind of person you are! 

TEST RULES
There are only two possible answers to each question. You need to choose between option A and option B. As you‚Äôre taking the test, keep track of how many times you chose A or B because you‚Äôll need these totals at the end of the video to find out your results. You‚Äôll only have 5 seconds to think about each question before we give the explanation. Don‚Äôt think too long, and go with your gut; you‚Äôll get the most accurate results that way!

WOULD YOU RATHER...
...be the smartest person or the most charming? 1:17
...you rather always have to tell the truth or lie? 1:47
...never have Internet or never take an airplane? 2:21
...find true love or win a million dollars? 3:04
...never be able to speak or have to say everything on your mind? 3:28
...have a photographic memory or be able to forget anything you want? 4:09
...never have sex again or never eat your favorite food? 4:50
...be the only person to live a happy life or be the only person to live an unhappy life? 5:19
...be the first person to discover an inhabitable planet or inventor of a drug that cures a deadly disease? 5:58
...be poor but able to help people or get incredibly rich by hurting other people? 6:38

SUMMARY
If you chose A 1 to 3 times, you‚Äôre a pretty selfish person. Very few people would like to work with you on a team. It‚Äôs not that bad though; it just means that you prefer fighting for yourself to get exactly what you want. 

If you chose option A 4 to 6 times, it means that you‚Äôre moderately selfish. You‚Äôre like the Goldilocks of this list: not too much, not too little, just right. Pretty much most people would fall into this category. You can be selfish when you need to be.

If you chose option A 7 to 10 times, you‚Äôre the type of person who is always ready to sacrifice your own interests for someone else. 

What results did you get? Do you agree with them? Tell us in the comments section below!

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Jeremy Morris - I read that the video game Hitman is going to be a tv series on hulu. Is this true? If so, do you think the tv show can succeed where the movies didn‚Äôt? I thought the second one was ok but neither hit it out of the park. Your thoughts?

Abram Ren - hey John big fan i see all your videos everyday i wanted to ask since the dark universe seems about dead at this point do you think it would be a good idea if blumhouse took over and made low budget horror movies with the universal monsters?

Matthew Fraser -  On a previous show, you talked about Disney having to spend billions to buy Netflix. My question is, wouldn‚Äôt Disney removing their content from the service cause a large enough decline in subscription total to make a noticeable loss.

Simone Umba - With Avatar supposedly set to release in 2020, it adds to the list of upcoming releases. Fast 9, Indiana Jones 5, Godzilla vs. Kong. Would it be risky for a studio to set a release date for a movie in 2020 now since it's so tight pack now? Could Avatar push it's release up against an upcoming film?

Linda Marccini - With Ben Affleck sounding more and more like his days as Batman are numbered (Looks like you were right all along) my question isn‚Äôt who should replace him because I know you hate those questions, but rather who should they replace. Replace Affleck as Bruce Wayne, or replace Bruce Wayne as Batman. Nightwing? Joseph Gordon Levitt‚Äôs character? Thomas Wayne as Batman?

Roberto DeSalva - As anticipated the Wonder Woman sequel has moved to November. But with it being announced that both Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot are locked to return, does that mean WB reached an agreement with Brett Ratner to not produce Wonder Woman 2 since Gadot said she wouldn‚Äôt do the movie otherwise?

Walter Da Silva - I am a huge movie fan and love the superhero genre. I am starting to hear more chatter about the Infinity War trailer in my opinion if it drops this week that will be nothing more than a bully tactic. I love the MCU but I would disappointed in them and wait a few weeks after IW comes out before I go see and give the theaters a bigger piece of the pie as my protest.

Imaginar que entre t√∫ y yo no hay una pantalla (una pantalla, baby)
Que pida que erices mi piel con s√≥lo rozarla
Ay, me muero de ganas
Y aunque te encuentres lejos
No he renunciado a la esperanza de conocernos
Y de olvidarme del celular y estar cuerpo a cuerpo (cuerpo a cuerpo, baby)
Dar rienda suelta a la locura y el deseo
De comerte a besos

[Coro: Ana Mena, Becky G]
Y ya es hora
Que negociemos ponerle fin a tanta demora
Que necesito quemar el fuego que me acalora
Y saciarme de ti, y tocar el cielo, y vivir lo nuestro
Y ya es hora
Que terminemos con esta ansia que nos devora
Que necesito de tus caricias aqu√≠ y ahora (yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Y pong√°mosle fin a tanto anhelo, pa' vivir lo nuestro

[Post-Coro: Ana Mena]
Todos mis sentidos se alborotan
Quiero derretirme despacito en tu boca
Hoy me marcho para all√≠ que tengo ganas de ti
Dale, que te caigo en unas horas

[Verso 2: Ana Mena, De La Ghetto]
(Ana Mena)
Te mando un privado, chateas conmigo
Lo que dar√≠a por un vis a vis
Te huelo a distancia, no importa la hora
Yo sigo aqu√≠ esper√°ndote en Madrid, yeah
DeLa
Yo tambi√©n quiero verte
Muchas de ganas de tenerte
Hacerte muchas cosas en la cama diferente (t√∫ sabe')
S√© que lo mismo sientes (dale)
Hoy es tu d√≠a de suerte (geezy)
Por eso voy a hacer que s√≥lo en m√≠ t√∫ siempre pienses
Es hora, baby, que salgamos del deseo ya
Dejemo' el juego y lleguemos a la intimidad
Que [?] pa' acabar tu necesidad
Dime d√≥nde voy a llegar, baby

[Puente: Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Puede que sea una locura
Pero este amor va m√°s all√° de una simple aventura (aventura)
Y es que mi cuerpo pide m√°s que otra foto tuya (foto tuya, baby)
Quiero una noche de pasi√≥n que alivie esta tortura
Y acabe con mis dudas

[Coro: Ana Mena, Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Y ya es hora
Que negociemos ponerle fin a tanta demora
Que necesito quemar el fuego que me acalora
Y saciarme de ti, y tocar el cielo, y vivir lo nuestro
Y ya es hora
Que terminemos con esta ansia que nos devora
Que necesito de tus caricias aqu√≠ y ahora (oh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Y pong√°mosle fin a tanto anhelo, pa' vivir lo nuestro
De La Ghetto, De La Geezy

[Post-Coro: Ana Mena, & Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Todos mis sentidos se alborotan
Quiero derretirme despacito en tu boca
Hoy me marcho para all√≠
Que tengo ganas de t√≠
Dale que te caigo en unas horas (baby, ok)
Todos mis sentidos se alborotan (Becky G)
Quiero derretirme despacito en tu boca (De La Geezy baby)
Hoy me marcho para all√≠ (Dabruk)
Que tengo ganas de t√≠ (Ana Mena)
Dale que te caigo en unas horas (ya es hora)

On February 2, 2018, Donkey Kong Forum removed three of Mitchell's highest scores from its high-scores list following analysis by Jeremy Young who stated that the scores were set using the MAME arcade emulator instead of arcade hardware.[30] Mitchell stated on the East Side Dave Show, ""I‚Äôve never even played MAME. I don‚Äôt have MAME loaded in my home."" Mitchell continues by saying ""The film footage that he has, that Jeremy has, shows MAME play... I‚Äôm not disputing what he says. What I‚Äôm disputing is the fact that I want him to have the original tape.‚Äù Young's analysis has been criticized by Mitchell as being from an altered tape that otherwise matches Billy's gameplay pixel-for-pixel, to which Young responds that ""The amount of foresight, patience, and technical knowledge required would be staggering"" to make such tapes.

On April 12, 2018, Twin Galaxies announced that an investigation conducted into Mitchell's submitted scores found evidence that he did not use an unmodified version of the arcade game, and thus used either an emulator or some other disallowed means of achieving the scores. Twin Galaxies said that they had removed Mitchell's scores from their records and that he would be prohibited from submitting scores in the future.

To date, Mitchell has a single publicly witnessed high score of 933,900 from 2004.\",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kx69bGaOfe0/sddefault.jpg,0.009193001852932444,0.0018529324447447355,4.961325966850829,0.007145562687468648,0.01104593429767718,0.018191496985145827,2018-04-16,15:55:20,Monday,0,10,63,10,30,61,517,0,61,0,0,8,0,2,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.733231965328917,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

The only problem is... We don't know which face in the video belongs to HowToBasic. HowToBasic has created a small puzzle game as we see at the end of his video a code flashes up. When decoding this through Wingdings we get '/Watch?v' hinting that there's a HowToBasic unlisted video somewhere hidden on the internet revealing the true identity of HowToBasic.

So, today! I'm doing what I do best and will solve the mystery! It's taken some serious time into figuring out what it all means, but I think I've finally uncovered the real unlisted video HowToBasic is talking about. Be prepared my fellow friends. You may not like the truth... About How. To. Basic.

Los Sifones Restaurant is a neighborhood Mexican food restaurant in Mexico City that has a great family atmosphere. When I saw a few photos of the molcajete caliente, a flaming stone mortar of salsa and meat, I knew it was a place I need to eat.

We drove from central Mexico City, and arrived at the friendly family style restaurant. I ordered molcajete caliente de bistec and some carne asada tacos loaded with avocado. For the molcajete caliente, they put it on the hot plate, added the beef, onions, salsa until it boiled, cheese, avocado and cactus. They serve it to you flaming hot - literally lava salsa. It was every bit as good as it looked, and it remained hot for our entire meal.

This was one of the best sit down, family style restaurant meals I had in Mexico City. I loved it, especially their generous use of avocado.

Total price - 508 MXN ($27.23)

// What is Tesla Model 3? (src: wikipedia)
The Tesla Model 3 is a mid-size all-electric four-door sedan manufactured and sold by Tesla, Inc.[1] According to Tesla officials, the Model 3 standard model delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of 220 miles (354 km) and the long-range model delivers 310 miles (500 km).[7] The Model 3 has a minimalist dashboard with only a center-mounted LCD touchscreen.[11]

Within a week of unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car, more than triple the number of Model S sedans sold by the end of 2015. These reservations represent potential sales of over US$14 billion.[12][13] By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations, and an average of 1,800 reservations were being added per day.[14][15]

Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017,[16][17][18] and the official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars on July 28.[19] Customer deliveries totaled 1,764 units in 2017.[20][21] Tesla's target for making 5,000 vehicles per week is projected at the end of June 2018, after previously promising earlier dates.[22][23][24]

Tesla stated that the Model 3 carries full self-driving hardware to be optionally enabled at a future date.[25][26][27]

History

Original Tesla Model 3 logo
The Model 3 was codenamed Tesla BlueStar in the original business plan in 2007.[36][37] The name Model 3, originally stylized as ""Model ‚ò∞"", was announced on Musk's Twitter account on July 16, 2014,[38] however, the intended name was Model E that was abandoned due to Ford's trademark on the name; Musk wanted the three current models to spell SEX, but settled with ""S3X"".[39] In early 2017, after trademark opposition from Adidas,[40] the triplicate horizontal-bar stylization was abandoned and changed to a numeric ""3"".[41]

The company plans for the Model 3 are part of Tesla's three-step strategy to start with a high-price vehicle and move progressively towards lower-cost vehicles, while the battery and electric drivetrain were improved and paid for through the sales of the Roadster, Model S, and Model X vehicles.[42]

Design

In 2013, design chief Franz von Holzhausen said that the Model 3 will ""be an Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class type of vehicle that will offer everything: range, affordability, and performance"" that is targeted toward the mass market.[43] While technology from Tesla's Model S will be used in the Model 3,[44] it will be 20% smaller than the Model S[45] and have its own unique design.[46] According to Tesla's CTO, JB Straubel, in October 2015, most Tesla engineers were working on the 3 rather than S or X.[47][48] Since electric cars have lower cooling needs than combustion cars, the Model 3 does not have a front grille. Musk intended for the final design to be released on June 30, 2016[49] but when the design was finished on July 27, it was not publicly released.[50] After the final design of the first Model 3, any further changes would be included in future versions of the Model 3.[51] The optional glass roof developed by Tesla Glass will be made of the same glass used for Tesla's roof tiles;[52] a glass roof was introduced on the Model S in late 2016.[53]",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KyQOhjm5NyA/sddefault.jpg,0.010020980406108356,0.0010557509581564934,9.491803278688524,0.001998042341574857,0.011076731364264849,0.013074773705839707,2018-04-20,13:59:52,Friday,4,12,74,12,46,65,546,2,114,1,0,9,0,5,4,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.667400540327362,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'truck': 1, 'car': 2, 'person': 2}",5

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ANDR√â chronicles the life and career of Andr√© Leon Talley, former Vogue magazine editor-at-large and one of the fashion industry‚Äôs and New York culture's most influential icons. Beginning his career at Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory in the 1970s before climbing the ranks of the New York fashion editorial world, Talley made a lasting impact by pushing to include African-American models and designers in such major publications as Women‚Äôs Wear Daily, W, and Vogue magazine. Today, his judgment is sought by top designers, stylists, and celebrity clientele. Featuring fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour, Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Valentino, and Manolo Blahnik testifying to Andr√©‚Äôs gifts, the film traces his journey with rich archival footage that summons multiple eras of stylish and outlandish clothing.

In theaters May 25th.

Here is what you'll need!

MATERIALS
Aquarium sealant
Paper clip
Microfiber towel
Newspaper
Rubber bands
Hair dryer
Rice

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Apply aquarium sealant to the gaps in leaky rain boots to stop leaking. Let the sealant dry overnight before using the boots.
2. Fix a broken umbrella arm by straightening a paper clip and using pliers to tightly wrap it through the joint‚Äôs hole and around the metal.
3. Dry wet socks faster by rolling in a microfiber towel and squeezing for 30 seconds so that the majority of the moisture is soaked up.
4. Dry shoes faster by balling up newspaper inside them and wrapping the outside of the shoes with it, securing with rubber bands. Use a hair dryer on its lowest setting to help speed up drying. Unwrap shoes when newspaper is dry.
5. Put wet phone in a bag of rice and leave overnight to combat water damage.

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

MY VLOG SERIES - A SNEAK PEAK INTO HOLLYWOOD AND BEHIND THE SCENES:
I also have a VLOG series where I take you behind the scenes from when I meet with Hollywood stars at different interview locations and give you a little sneak peak of what it's like to interview some of Hollywoods biggest stars. In my VLOGS I also take you to premieres, Hollywood parties, premiere after-parties, red carpets, The Oscars, The Golden Globes - and travels to film festivals, like Toronto, Cannes and Venice, comic-con in San Diego, as well as the typical film junket. I share some of my favorite interview tricks, some amazing, funny moments, but also some of my bloopers and less proud or awkward moments. So please come along for the ride behind the scenes in Hollywood, and don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions or leave comments in the description section. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

That has Kylie super annoyed and hoping that Daniels will fade away so her daughter‚Äôs name won‚Äôt be associated with the adult actress. ‚ÄúThough the spelling is different and in no way was her daughter named after Stormy Daniels, Kylie is hoping that Stormy will be out of the news soon because she hates people tweeting and talking about her daughter having a porn star name. Its bothering Kylie that people would even dare connect the two,‚Äù a source close to the reality star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

About BEAUTIFUL -- THE CAROLE KING MUSICAL:
Long before she was Carole King, chart-topping music legend, she was Carol Klein, Brooklyn girl with passion and chutzpah. She fought her way into the record business as a teenager and, by the time she reached her twenties, had the husband of her dreams and a flourishing career writing hits for the biggest acts in rock 'n' roll. But it wasn't until her personal life began to crack that she finally managed to find her true voice.

BEAUTIFUL tells the inspiring true story of King's remarkable rise to stardom, from being part of a hit songwriting team with her husband Gerry Goffin, to her relationship with fellow writers and best friends Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, to becoming one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history. Along the way, she made more than BEAUTIFUL music, she wrote the soundtrack to a generation.

 About Rainbow Six Siege:
 Rainbow Six Siege is the upcoming installment of the acclaimed first-person shooter franchise developed by the renowned Ubisoft Montreal studio for the new generation of consoles and PC.

 Inspired by the reality of counter terrorist operatives across the world, Rainbow Six Siege invites players to master the art of destruction. Intense close quarters confrontations, high lethality, tactics, team play, and tension are at the center of the experience.

 The multiplayer gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege sets the new bar for intense firefights and expert strategy in the rich legacy of past Rainbow Six Games.

 THE SIEGE GAMEPLAY
 For the first time in Rainbow Six, players witl engage in sieges, a brand-new style of assault. Enemies now have the means to transform their environments into strongholds: they can trap, fortify, and create defensive systems to prevent breach by Rainbow teams.

 To face this challenge, players have a level of freedom unrivaled by any previous Rainbow Six game. Combining tactical maps, observation drones, and a new rappel system, Rainbow teams have more options than ever before to plan, attacks, and diffuse these situations.

 COUNTER TERRORIST UNITS
 Counter terrorist operatives are trained to handle extreme situations, such as hostage rescue, with surgical precision. As ‚Äúshort range‚Äù specialists, their training is concentrated on indoor environments. Operating in tight formations, they are experts of close quarter combat, demolitions, and coordinated assaults. Rainbow Six Siege will include operators coming from five of the most worldwide renowned CTU: the British SAS, the American SWAT, the French GIGN, the German GSG9 and Russian SPETSNAZ.

 These Operators are specialists with their own expertise within Siege operations. Each has their own unique personality & specialty. Some are focused on assault whereas others are defense-oriented. They can be combined within the same team to create new team strategies.

 PROCEDURAL DESTRUCTION
 Destruction is at the heart of the siege gameplay. Players now have the unprecedented ability to destroy environments. Walls can be shattered, opening new lines of fire, and ceiling and floors can be breached, creating new access points. Everything in the environment reacts realistically, dynamically, and uniquely based on the size and caliber of bullets you are using or the amount of explosives you have set. In Rainbow Six Siege, destruction is meaningful and mastering it is often the key to victory.

LETRA (VERS√ÉO CLIPE)

Haaan... Gloria Groove
Ai, me segura!

Quem √© esse cara?
Que quando ele chega meu cora√ß√£o dispara
Olhos nos meus olhos, despertou minha tara
Quase fico louca se ele n√£o me repara, menino, p√°ra!
Todo aventureiro
Muleke safado, s√≥ pode ser brasileiro
Swingando desse jeito, vai ser o primeiro
Sorrindo pra mim, instigando, todo faceiro
Bem ligeiro

E olha que eu prometi pra mim
Que n√£o ia me deixar levar assim
Cair nos encantos desse malandrin
Mas se ele chega junto eu vou at√© o fim
Eu t√¥ afim

Muleke Brasileiro
Vai ser o primeiro
Muleke Brasileiro
Pode chegar sem medo
Muleke Brasileiro
Vai ser o primeiro
Muleke Brasileiro
Beijar seu corpo inteiro

Muleke Brasileiro
Jeitinho trai√ßoeiro
Vou correndo atr√°s de tu no Rio de Janeiro
Menino sexy, voc√™ tem o que eu preciso
Dif√≠cil vai ser resistir a esse teu sorriso
Chega na maldade, v√™ se rola, rola
Se eu disser que sim, pode p√°, cola, cola
Fala no ouvido s√≥ pra causar um arrepio
Garoto assanhado, j√≥ia rara do Brasil
S√≥ de pensar em algum dia n√£o te ter aqui
J√° d√° vontade de pegar sua m√£o, correr, fugir
Meu cora√ß√£o n√£o diz que sim, tamb√©m n√£o diz que n√£o
Mas sei l√°, se quiser tentar
Garoto, te garanto que vai se apaixonar

Muleke Brasileiro
Vai ser o primeiro
Muleke Brasileiro
Pode chegar sem medo
Muleke Brasileiro
Vai ser o primeiro
Muleke Brasileiro
Beijar seu corpo inteiro

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Brasileiro

Check out the LG Gram: https://amzn.to/2IHiBeV

My take on a minimal laptop desk that keeps things streamlined and lets me use my laptop at my desk or on the go ‚Äì no muss, no fuss. It has just three main components: the laptop, the desk, and the monitor. The centerpiece is, of course, the LG gram 2018. It's portable, super light and incredibly powerful ‚Äì with a high-performance 8th Gen. Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD and up to 17 hours of battery life. It also has tons of ports, including a USB Type-C‚Ñ¢ port ‚Äì which is what makes it possible to connect the gram to a monitor for a minimal desk setup.

The non $369 Chair! https://amzn.to/2JyJpzr



Starting from the ground up, the desk is from IKEA, and has some seriously solid wood and contrasting legs. On top of the desk is the LG 27UK850-W ‚Äì a 4K UHD IPS display that can be used horizontally or vertically. It also has a USB Type-C‚Ñ¢ port that connects the monitor to the gram and makes all the magic happen. The mouse and keyboard are from Microsoft and connect to the back of the monitor, so you can leave them at the desk, where they'll be ready whenever you are.

As for the chair, it's from Amazon.com, and it's super affordable, insanely comfortable, and looks great with the desk. Last, but not least, are the speakers. They're actually the LG SJ7 sound bar ‚Äì and not only do they look and sound amazing, but they connect wirelessly to the gram, and makes the whole minimal desk setup really work.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L3mSlSYfSnU/sddefault.jpg,0.020943229862180585,0.0011034421596767784,18.97990726429676,0.0011392571293108006,0.022046672021857363,0.02318592915116817,2018-04-11,19:54:34,Wednesday,2,6,73,6,38,37,522,0,106,0,0,6,0,1,0,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.7819945225947045,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'keyboard': 1, 'mouse': 1, 'laptop': 1, 'tv': 1, 'potted plant': 1}",5

Lyrics
(Intro Hook)
I'm feeling so gone,
Don't try to find me,
Can't see what I'm on
Feel like I'm sinking x2

(Verse 1)
Falling out of my thoughts lately
My thoughts move out of my body
My head keeps pounding
My thoughts feel faded
Getting sick of the shit people playing
I'm faded I'm gone
I'm faded I'm gone
I'm feeling so gone
I'm feeling so gone

(Hook 2)
I'm feeling so gone,
Don't try to find me,
Can't see what I'm on
Feel like I'm sinking x2
(Verse 2) 
Feeling so gone lately
Vietcong in my brain, gone insane exploding,
Feeling so high lately,
My hearts gone to sleep for the morning,
Been mourning my death, 
Alive but asleep feeling dead,
Tell me what the fucks this shit,
Feel so out of it,
Feel so out of it,
(Final hook)
I'm feeling so gone,
Don't try to find me
Can't see what I'm on feel like I'm sinking x2",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L43U7nFpxo8/sddefault.jpg,0.02871800245786852,0.0004739494517428955,60.5929648241206,0.00785708161457192,0.029191951909611408,0.03704903352418333,2018-04-29,20:02:35,Sunday,6,8,18,8,18,47,164,5,44,4,3,3,12,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.785473056144031,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

What is Stop Motion?

Stop motion is a way of animation which makes it look like still objects are moving. Clay animation is a good example of how stop motion is used. Stop-motion requires any camera that can make single frames (or photos). It works by shooting a single frame, moving the object a little bit, and capturing a frame again. 

The Characters: 

Rey 

Rey was a scavenger and Force prodigy who discovered her latent Force-sensitivity while on a journey to find the legendary Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and bring a new hope to a galaxy on the brink of war. Rey grew up alone in the desert wastes of Jakku, longing for her family to return, until she met BB-8, who carried information about Skywalker's whereabouts.

Kylo Ren 

Kylo Ren, a human male, was a Force warrior and a former Jedi trainee under his uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, before Ren destroyed Skywalker's attempt to restore the Jedi Order and became an apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order. 

Finn 

Finn fought for the Resistance during their war against the First Order, which he previously served in as a stormtrooper prior to defecting. He was considered one of the best stormtroopers of the FN Corps, where he was designated FN-2187, prior to deserting with the help of Commander Poe Dameron of the Resistance. Finn reluctantly became involved with BB-8, Rey, Han Solo, and Chewbacca as they made their way to the Resistance base on D'Qar so BB-8 could provide General Leia Organa with a map to her brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.

BB-8

BB-8 was a BB-series astromech droid who operated approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. It had a dome head, similar to that of R2 series astromech droids, with the bulk of its body made up of a ball on which the droid's head rolled.

L6SBTb_zJyE,5n9xafjynJA,Tesla Semi (2020) Badass Performance Electric Truck,YOUCAR,2.0,2017-11-17 07:44:25+00:00,"['tesla truck', 'tesla semi', 'tesla semi-trailer', 'tesla semi performance', 'insane mode', 'tesla semi features', 'autonomous']",273005.0,1564.0,144.0,337.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L6SBTb_zJyE/default.jpg,"Without a¬†trailer, the 2020 Tesla Semi achieves 0-60 mph in 5 seconds, compared to¬†15¬†seconds in a comparable diesel¬†truck. It does 0-60 mph in 20 seconds with a full 80,000-pound load, a task¬†that takes a diesel¬†truck¬†about¬†a¬†minute. Most notably for truck drivers and other travelers on the¬†road, it climbs¬†5% grades at¬†a¬†steady 65 mph,¬†whereas a diesel truck maxes out at 45 mph on a¬†5% grade. The Tesla Semi requires no¬†shifting or clutching for smooth¬†acceleration and deceleration, and its¬†regenerative braking recovers 98% of kinetic energy to the battery, giving¬†it a basically¬†infinite¬†brake¬†life. Overall, the Semi is more responsive,¬†covers more miles than a diesel truck in the same amount of time,¬†and more¬†safely integrates with passenger car traffic.

The Tesla Semi‚Äôs all-electric architecture is designed to have a higher¬†safety standard than any other heavy-duty truck¬†on the market, with¬†a reinforced battery that shields the Semi from impact and gives it an¬†exceptionally low center of¬†gravity.¬†Its windshield is made of impact resistant glass.¬†Jackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard¬†sensors that detect¬†instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while¬†independently actuating all¬†brakes. The surround cameras aid object detection¬†and minimize blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety¬†hazards and obstacles. With Enhanced Autopilot, the Tesla Semi¬†features Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping, Lane Departure¬†Warning, and¬†event recording.

Tesla Semi¬†can also travel in a convoy, where one or several¬†Semi trucks will be able¬†to autonomously follow a lead Semi.

All-in, the Tesla Semi delivers massive savings in energy costs,¬†performance,¬†efficiency and reliability.
The biggest immediate cost-advantage comes from savings in energy costs: fully loaded,¬†the Tesla Semi consumes less than two¬†kilowatt-hours of energy per¬†mile and is capable of 500 miles of range at GVW and highway speed,¬†accommodating a wide range¬†of¬†shipping¬†applications given that nearly¬†80% of freight in the U.S. is¬†moved less than 250 miles.¬†Coupled with the low and stable nature of¬†electricity prices ‚Äì which average $0.12/kWh in the U.S. and can be¬†significantly¬†less for commercial and industrial users, falling to almost¬†nothing when combined with local solar generation and storage ‚Äì¬†owners can¬†expect to gain $200,000 or more in savings over a million miles based on fuel¬†costs alone.

Reservations for the Tesla Semi can be made for $5,000 USD per truck. Production in 2019.

Sometimes, a company in Japan decides they're gonna give it all they got, and the result is a wacky machine like this.  Pioneer, the company that brought you pretty much everything to do with Laserdisc, designed this wonderful series of machines which are both single side Laserdisc players and 5 disc CD changers.  Due to the limitations of the Laserdisc format, a rather robotic solution was needed to do the job.

Curious about New Game Plus and the removal of previous Completionist episodes? The answers are in my update video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onlCuZEn9e4

In my Shadow of the Colossus review, BluePoint has nailed it. The original game is an emotional journey and it has been remastered in this HD remake for PS4, with new sound effects, amazing visuals, and control revamps. The original game is considered by many as art, and it has a strong emotional impact as you slay these colossi to bring back the one you love. It's a tragic story and overall, Shadow of the Colossus is boss battles the game! Each colossi is so unique, I'm excited to complete this game as I haven't before.

Lyrics:
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see reindeer really know how to fly
So, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

2018 Kanye has been the strangest, cryptic Kanye to date, spouting political / cultural opinions that took a cut from his image & supporters. Now he has returned from Wyoming in full album mode, starting with a full reproduced Pusha T album, followed by this release he has dubbed ‚Äúye‚Äù and finally rounding off with a highly anticipated collab album with Kid Cudi.

This man had an album cover on the way to his release party, but the fact he actually said a release date of June 1st and stuck with it is new (I am still haunted by the TLOP drop)

Will this album scoop in the poop? Or, will it sadly oopsity woops?

We all know that celebrities are always buying themselves the best of everything, and who can blame them? But sometimes they pay it forward and give their adoring fans incredibly generous gifts. We will show you some of the most expensive gifts ever given to fans by the celebs that they adore. You might not think that Kim Kardashian would ever part with shoes, but she and Kanye West donated 1,000 pairs to an amazing cause. Her sister, Kylie Jenner bought her biggest fan a stunning Louis Vuitton bag worth over $2,000. Not only did Taylor Swift send some of her fans gifts from all over the world, but she even included heartfelt, handwritten notes. Do you think that these gifts were genuine acts of kindness, or calculated publicity stunts? Let us know what you think in the comment section, and make sure that you‚Äôre subscribed to TheTalko for more of our great videos.

Don't do these 5 things with your money: https://youtu.be/BkCmAfliYlM


Why Most Americans Are Broke
0:22 - The majority of people are broke
1:03 - Many people like to put their money on luck and gambling than on growth
2:11 - We are never taught about money
3:31 - People are not investing
5:08 - Most people don‚Äôt make a budget and stick to it
6:19 - Americans are spending too much to live the American dream they can‚Äôt afford


What Is The Minority Mindset?
The Minority Mindset has nothing to do with the way you look or what kind of family you're from. It's a mindset.

Give the majority $200 and they will come back with a pair of shoes. Give the minority $200 they will come back with $2,000.

Think from the mindset of a consumer and be the provider, that's the Minority Mindset. Don't be the majority. #MIH #ThinkMinority #FinancialLiteracy

First thing to know is that her name isn't ""Isshe."" That's just a catchy Instagram handle. We get in deep into the European drag, her fascination with insects, genealogy and cultural identity, and her fishy past.

Elon Musk shows off what SpaceX will use to build BFR spaceship
Elon Musk just unveiled a giant tool SpaceX will use to build the biggest and most powerful spaceship in history

Introductions
  
Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, just showed off a huge development in his quest to build the largest and most powerful spaceship in history.
  
SpaceX is designing the launch system with two fully-reusable parts: a 191-foot-tall rocket booster and a 157-foot-tall spaceship, which sits on top.
Once assembled, a BFR would stand about 15% taller than the Statue of Liberty and be able to launch 100 people and 150 tons of cargo into orbit around Earth. After a refueling in space, a ship could reach Mars in about 6 months.
 
According to Musk, most of SpaceX's engineering resources are now focused on BFR ‚Äî and the spaceship in particular.
Keeping that in mind in this video, Engineering Today will analyze Elon Musk posted photo of a giant cylinder to Instagram. What Musk's new photo reveals? Could SpaceX Mars‚Äôs mission happen sooner than we think?

So, Let‚Äôs start.

WHAT MUSK'S NEW PHOTO REVEALS
   
Musk's image is small and grainy, and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for more details; yet the image nonetheless reveals quite a bit.
A Tesla Model 3 is about 15.5 feet long, which means the tool next to it is about 30 feet in diameter and 40 feet long. The internal supports and central spindle also hint that the whole thing can rotate.
 
The dimensions match Musk's latest description of the BFR spaceship. Likewise, the spinning backs up SpaceX's plan to build the spaceship almost entirely out of carbon-fiber: a super-lightweight, ultra-strong material.

 
This is why many rocket manufacturers now weave carbon-fiber thread into fuel tanks and other parts. If a rocket's weight can be reduced, heavier payloads can reach space; for larger vessels, this can translate to thousands of pounds of cargo. Safety is also improved, since carbon-fiber holds up better against the punishing forces of launch.
 
The company uses some of the material in its Falcon Heavy rocket system, for example. And in October 2017, Musk revealed a nearly 40-foot-wide cryogenic fuel tank made out of the stuff.
Spacex developed a new carbon-fiber matrix that's much stronger and more capable than anything before, and it holds 1,200 tons of liquid oxygen.

HOW THE CARBON-FIBER SPACESHIP TOOL MIGHT WORK
Carbon-fiber thread on its own isn't of too much use to aerospace engineers. But when the material is woven, impregnated with glues, and cured with heat, it takes on otherworldly properties.
 
The most precise way to create it is with robots.
A robot weaves a carbon-fiber filament around a spinning tank in a diamond pattern. Afterward, it winds a coating of adhesives around the tank, and then workers cure the whole thing in an oven to create the final carbon-fiber composite material.
 
For now, as Musk's photo shows, the tool is being kept in a tent ‚Äî most likely the 20,000-square-foot tent that SpaceX recently put up at a nearby site at the port.
Eventually, SpaceX will need some very large robots decked out with weaving, adhesives, and heat-curing tools.
 
To get a sense of how SpaceX's super-size carbon-fiber molding operation might work, the picture shows, how a robot at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in 2014 worked on a fuel tank that stretched 18 feet in diameter:
SPACEX MARS MISSION COULD HAPPEN SOONER
 
Once a BFR spaceship body is formed into a leak-proof shell, it will likely be removed from its mold.
 
SpaceX engineers will then have to attach four room-size Raptor rocket engines and two other engines, plus all of the other internal propellant tanks, plumbing, and electronics that a rocket requires.
The first enormous BFR spaceship ‚Äî about 35 feet longer than NASA's space shuttle orbiters ‚Äî could be built, shipped to SpaceX's testing facility in McGregor, Texas, and start ""short hopper flights"" by early 2019.
Conclusions

 
Assuming the spaceship doesn't blow up during its testing, SpaceX will move on to the BFR booster.

Musk said late last year that his ""aspirational"" timeline for a first BFR launch to Mars will happen 2022, followed by the first crewed mission in 2024.
 
He hopes to eventually colonize Mars with BFR spaceships as a backup plan for humanity.
 
Musk said at the South by Southwest festival in March, that - ""It will start off building just the most elementary infrastructure, just a base to create some propellant, a power station, blast domes in which to grow crops ‚Äî all of the sort of fundamentals without which you cannot survive"". ""And then really there's gonna be an explosion of entrepreneurial opportunity, because Mars will need everything from iron foundries to pizza joints. I think Mars should really have great bars: the Mars Bar.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L9HvZ1BGPSs/sddefault.jpg,0.012653804268322416,0.004323586301058141,2.9266917293233083,0.001706678803049266,0.01697739056938056,0.018684069372429824,2018-04-10,07:20:43,Tuesday,1,18,62,18,46,99,531,1,94,0,1,1,4,8,0,5.0,8.0,"['WHAT ATC ri n 23k CH B.

Even though letting go feels right

You and I are bound together
Especially since cartoons live forever

The 38-year-old spoke honestly about his recent behavior and admitted ""a lot of what had happened was self-inflicted"" prior to taking his psych meds.

The Fast and Furious star began by shedding light on his custody battle with ex-wife Norma Mitchell over their 10-year-old daughter Shayla. Mitchell had accused him of abusing their daughter.

""My daughter got spanked two times in ten years. The first time I spanked my daughter was because her mama asked me to. The second time I spanked my daughter was because I told her to tell me the truth about something she had done and she didn't. So I spanked her with my right hand on her butt.""



He continued: ""So when her mom - who I gave her the heads up - she ended up going to court on September 11th and literally accused me of abusing my baby and literally traumatized me forever.""

In November, Child Services closed their investigation and said they would not be seeking any criminal charges against the actor.

Tyrese is now happily married to his current wife Samantha Lee and wishes his ex nothing but the best.

""I don't wish no harm on that woman. I look forward to her finding someone, getting in a relationship and moving on with her life, so she could be happy.""

The Transformers star also revealed he only married his ex so that she could get her green card.

""Norma, I love you. I appreciate you. We made an angel, but I married you to keep you in the country. I never married you because I was happily married. You're from London.""

Tyrese moved on to his online battle with his Fast & Furious co-star The Rock, which stems from the former WWE star going forward with a franchise spin-off that will delay the start of Fast 9 by one year.



Tyrese said he reached out to The Rock privately to try to convince him to not do the spin-off first, but says he never heard from him. Tyrese then disclosed how he had turned down his own spin-off so as to not hold up the production.

""Me and Ludacris got offered a spin-off first. I turned it down. Ludacris wanted to do it. I said, 'We cannot take 16 years of a multi-ethnic cast in a movie on a scale of the Fast & the Furious and decide to make a selfish move and the make the franchise about us.'""

He then spoke the truth on his claim that Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith offered to give him $5 million, which they later refuted.

""Did I have a conversation with Jada Pinkett Smith? Yes. Did I even have one conversation with Will Smith? I did not. But we all know that if you have a conversation with the wife you have a conversation with the husband.""

While Tyrese said the A-list couple had offered the money to help with his legal fees and to keep him off the internet, a source claimed the couple had not offered the cash and were ""extremely worried"" he'd have a mental breakdown.

A week later Tyrese tried to explain his outbursts by saying he had a bad reaction to the drug Rexulti, which is used to treat depression and schizophrenia.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LBO9We4wSrs/sddefault.jpg,0.004245995121843574,0.000536103939260592,7.920096852300242,0.0009982177464682694,0.004782099061104168,0.005780316807572436,2017-12-08,00:40:17,Friday,4,15,37,15,37,83,303,4,61,13,1,0,28,5,1,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.908929999467577,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tv': 1, 'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",3

[Lyrics]
(OPENING VERSE)
Perfect Scenerios don't exist,
Flip of a switch, love gone with the wind
One day you lose your mind, next day your crib
Snap back to real, and you can't feel a thing.
It's crazy really, these thots fake feelings, always spinning webs they weaving,
Clock keeps ticking but nothings changing,
They whisper insanity in and out my brain
Pleading for my life,
Begging for some kind of change,
Nothing feels different.
Harlots hold me hostage, just craving some love, but these snakes fucking robbed it.
(Prehook 1)
Lift me off my feet,
Catch me in your winds,
Breathless when you speak,
Couldn't say a thing, no.
(Hook 1)
Spin my brain, like a Hurricane
Destroying everything, in your way
Spin my brain, like a Hurricane
Destroying everything, in your way
 
(Verse 2)
It's a crazy feeling
When the love I'm giving, is always spinning
I miss when I could day dream love
Life keeps moving
But I'm not changing, fading insanity
I'm numb like Novocain 

(Prehook 2)
Lift me off my feet
Catch me in your winds
Breathless when you speak
Couldn't say a thing no.

(Hook 2)
Spin my brain, like a Hurricane
Destroying everything, in your way
Spin my brain, like a Hurricane
Destroying everything, in your way",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LBlSnslHTmM/sddefault.jpg,0.0319831390938556,0.0011930211709537276,26.808526011560694,0.00683745948555272,0.033176160264809317,0.04001361975036205,2018-02-25,21:39:14,Sunday,6,7,20,7,20,52,201,6,55,1,0,4,5,0,0,7.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.238823581346644,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'surfboard': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Cuco is a Chicano singer and multi-instrumentalist who obsesses over cheesy love songs from a generation long gone. He swirls together oldies and early 2000's Chicano Rap with modern trap and psych to create a sultry, smooth sound. Bolstered by walloping west coast rhythms and wavy keyboard lines, Cuco and his band craft romantic ballads that are familiar but fresh and elastic enough to fit almost any setting. Check out the performance by Cuco on Audiotree Live.

Recorded on January 17, 2018 in Chicago, IL.

Hace dieciocho a√±os cambi√≥ mi vida.
.... volver√≠a a vivir todo porque me ha tra√≠do hasta aqu√≠, hasta el estudio de Guy Chambers, en Londres (productor de Robbie Williams, Annie Lenox, INX‚Ä¶) a atreverme otra vez a hacer algo diferente fuera de mi lugar de confort, sin mi banda, sin mi productor de siempre, y me ha hecho mucho bien volver a darme ese permiso. Aqu√≠ est√° la canci√≥n que me sali√≥ de dentro, gracias a ese camino recorrido que resume toda esta etapa y que hemos producido con GUY, mezclado con Richard Flack (Robbie, Take That, Tina Turner..) y masterizado con Ted Jensen.

Letra de Dieciocho:
RECUERDOS
EL CANTO, SON SUE√ëOS, POR TI 
TOCAMOS EL CIELO EN MI ESTADIO 
LLOR√ì EL CALDER√ìN EN MADRID 

SILENCIOS,
KIL√ìMETROS PARA VIVIR 
LADRONES Y D√çAS DORADOS 
Y CARAS QUE AUN SIGUEN AQU√ç 

T√ö SABES CU√ÅNTO TIEMPO
HA PASADO YA 
SABES QUE ESE TIEMPO NO VA A VOLVER 
Y SABES QUE YA NADA VOLVER√Å
A SER COMO ANTES 

NOS QUEDA UNA CANCI√ìN 
NOS QUEDA LA EMOCI√ìN 
Y LA GENERACI√ìN 
DE AQUELLOS A√ëOS LOCOS
HOY NOS QUEDA OTRA CANCI√ìN 
Y QUE MUERAS DE AMOR 
COMO PASABA EN LA FOTO 

PEQUE√ëO 
MI HERMANA LO HIZO POR MI 
LLORAMOS QUITANDO LAS MANOS 
Y FUIMOS VALIENTES POR FIN 
DE CERO 
CAMINA, QUE HAY QUE SEGUIR 
VER√ÅS QUE BONITA LA VIDA 
MONTA√ëA QUE ES COMO UN RING 

T√ö SABES CU√ÅNTO TIEMPO
HA PASADO YA 
SABES QUE ESE TIEMPO
NO VA A VOLVER 
Y SABES QUE YA NADA VOLVER√Å
A SER COMO ANTES 

NOS QUEDA UNA CANCI√ìN 
NOS QUEDA LA EMOCI√ìN 
Y LA GENERACI√ìN 
DE AQUELLOS A√ëOS LOCOS
HOY NOS QUEDA OTRA CANCI√ìN 
Y QUE MUERAS DE AMOR 
COMO PASABA EN LA FOTO 

OOOHHH OHHHH

T√ö SABES CU√ÅNTO TIEMPO
HA PASADO YA 
SABES QUE ESE TIEMPO
NO VA A VOLVER 
Y SABES QUE YA NADA VOLVER√Å
A SER COMO ANTES 

NOS QUEDA UNA CANCI√ìN 
NOS QUEDA LA EMOCI√ìN 
Y LA GENERACI√ìN 
DE AQUELLOS A√ëOS LOCOS

Y QUE MUERAS DE AMOR

Initially we took the bark and soaked for 7 days. Then we boil them for 8 hours. we pounded to produce pulp. We add Ca (OH) 2 lime to make white substance. we dried paper on hot stone. With the primitive technology we have created ancient writing paper. In the meantime our ancient tiles are of the best quality we will be implementing other projects.
