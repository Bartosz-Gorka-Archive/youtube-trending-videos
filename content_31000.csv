Cutrone shows Bon Appétit how to tenderize octopus, how to cook octopus, and explains why his Spanish octopus is just as good as - if not better than - lobster.

Vito Randazzo, chef and owner of Graziella's, praises Octopus Garden for the tenderness of the octopus he buys from them. Randazzo walks BA through the preparation process for serving the octopus and notes how rare a place like Octopus Garden is in today's marketplace.

  Good afternoon, I'm Kim Mok-yeon from the news center with the latest on the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
Let me give you a brief rundown of the highlights so far and what to look out for.
It's been one of the biggest stories of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics,... but the dreams of the joint-Korean women's ice hockey team were extinguished on Monday night with another heavy loss... this time against fifth-ranked Sweden.
  The team went down (eight-zero) in front of a crowd of over four-thousand in Gangneung.
Having lost their first match against Switzerland by the same score,... Korea have no chance of making the next round.
They will play their final match against ninth-ranked Japan on Wednesday. 
Japan were also eliminated on Monday after losing 3-1 to Switzerland.

 In freestyle skiing,... 
South Korea's Choi Jae-woo came up short in the men's moguls event,... despite an incredible run in the qualification round.
  Choi,... who finished first in the qualification round,... with 81-point-two-three points,... would go on to finish tied for 10th,... in the first final round. 
However, after losing control and crashing before the second jump stand,... the 23-year-old could not complete his run in the second round,... and failed to qualify for the medal round. 
Canada's mogul legend Mikael  Kingsbury ended up taking the gold, Australia's Matt Graham the silver... and Daichi Hara of Japan snagged the bronze.

  Moving on to short track speed skating...
South Korean star Choi Min-jeong is vying for her first Olympic gold in the women's 500 meters event on Tuesday night.
Choi is competing in the event that's scheduled to start at the Gangneung Ice Arena  at around 7PM, Korea time. 
  During Saturday's preliminaries, Choi set a new Olympic record with a time of 42 point-eight-seven seconds.
Many are looking forward to her performance as Team Korea has never won gold in the distance since the event was added to the Winter Games in 1992. 

 Now, let's take a more detailed look at what's ahead of us on Day Four.
The Men's Alpine Combined Slalom  is set for around 3 p.m. Korea time. 
Keep an eye out for South Korea's rising star Kim Dong-woo.

2- We are also looking forward to the Men's one-thousand meter short track speed skating event at half past seven. 
Lim Hyo-jun , South Korea's first gold medalist of this winter games will be in the second heat,... followed by Seo Yi-ra  and Hwang Dae-heon  in Heats 6 and 7.

3- Another notable event to watch for speed skating fans... the men's 1,500 meter final in speed skating is set for 8 p.m. 

4- And as I mentioned... the women's short track speed skating finals is happening at 9 p.m. tonight. All eyes will be on Choi Min-jeong  there. 

Let's wrap up by taking a look at the current medal standings. 
We will have more updates for you throughout the day so stay tuned.
I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

But there are so many different ways to fast these days, is one method better than all the rest? Personal trainer and health coach, Max Lowery says, cutting your eating down to just 2 meals a day is the best way to tackle fasting head-on. He also believes that the popular 16:8 method isn't as perfect as it seems.

With just one slight adjustment, he says you can make it far more effective. You can learn more about his lifestyle on Instagram.

--------------------------------------------------

Following is the transcript of the video:

Max Lowery: So 16:8 is basically, you break your day up into a period of a 16-hour fast with an 8-hour eating window. And I think it's just, you know, for me, it's just the more natural way of eating. Obviously, most people that start doing the two meal day is because of weight loss, and yes, they are losing weight but actually, we're constantly hearing how people have so much more energy throughout the day. They are not having, you know, this energy crashes because they aren't so dependent on food for energy, they are using body fat. They realize that they don't have to constantly eat to get themselves through the day.

So the reason I started the two meal day — it's not the 16:8, is because one of the main issues that people come into with the 16:8 is that they get obsessed with the time periods. And they start counting down the hours until they can eat and they end up eating because the clock tells them to rather than their body tells them to. It's essentially the same thing, in terms of, what's going on, but just changing the focus to listening to your body is when it becomes a way of life because you're understanding yourself better. 

If someone says, ""Okay, how do I start tomorrow?"" First of all, choose whether you're going to find it easier to skip dinner or you're going to find it's easier to skip breakfast. So say you're skipping breakfast, I would say, ""Okay, what time do you normally have your breakfast?"" Average person says 8 a.m. I'll say, ""Okay, rather than 8 a.m., go in to work or whatever you are doing and wait until 10 a.m. and see how you feel."" And then basically, over the course of two weeks, push until it's a 16-hour gap. And the whole time you are listening to your body, you're kind of, hopefully learning to understand that just because your stomach is empty, does not mean that you are hungry. 

Then the main thing is that you fundamentally need to be eating whole foods cooked from scratch. A lot of other intermittent fasting methods have been like, ""Oh no, you can eat what you want but just in a small time period"" or ""Eat what you want for 5 days."" That doesn't encourage changes in behavior long-term, which is obviously, fundamentally what the issue is for some people.

Lyrics
(Intro Hook)
I got fake friends, 
I got snake friends, 
I got real deal homies whipping new benz, 
I can chill with these snakes on the weekends,
Keep my homies close we taking tokes and laughing,
At the fake shit
At the fake shit
My homies got the vision we on woke shit
Ain't no broke shit
Ain't no broke shit
You fucking with my clique dead man walking
No more talking, 
No more talking,
Nobodies on the rise now people acting,
Like they didn't pray for targets on my back head
Fork these fake friends..fork these fake friends.
(Verse 1)
People keep snaking their way in our vision
We watching these villians keep thinking they're slick and
My homies keep laughing
We passing round gas and
These fake friends come back to start kissing our asses
Pick out your casket,
Your vision is plastic
My eyes on the masses
Your eye going blind
You've got dark on your mask batch
Make a mistake I'm the first one to notice
You act like you knew me than act like you know this.
I don't got time for the bullshoot
I don't got time for the bullshart
(Hook 1)
I got fake friends, 
I got snake friends, 
I got real deal homies whipping new benz, 
I can chill with these snakes on the weekends,
Keep my homies close we taking tokes and laughing,
At the fake shit
At the fake shit
My homies got the vision we on woke shit
Ain't no broke shit
Ain't no broke shit
You fucking with my clique dead man walking
No more talking, 
No more talking,
Nobodies on the rise now people acting,
Like they didn't pray for targets on my back head
Fork these fake friends..fork these fake friends.
(Verse 2)
Over and over I felt the cold shoulder
heart was a smolder like Cal with no burner
Darkness my nest but I'll pass every test that the worlds gotta give when I give it my best
Unstoppable
Unfathomable 
Nobody coming at you like Cannibal 
Untamable
Unnamable 
Voice of the broken unchainable 
People acting like they know me
People acting like they own me 
No they don't
You can't control me
So quit the bullshit take a seat and watch me
(Final Hook) 
I got fake friends, 
I got snake friends, 
I got real deal homies whipping new benz, 
I can chill with these snakes on the weekends,
Keep my homies close we taking tokes and laughing,
At the fake shit
At the fake shit
My homies got the vision we on woke shit
Ain't no broke shit
Ain't no broke shit
You fucking with my clique dead man walking
No more talking, 
No more talking,
Nobodies on the rise now people acting,
Like they didn't pray for targets on my back head
Fork these fake friends..fork these fake friends.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/con9JUhk7s0/sddefault.jpg,0.02532217016340075,0.000586336208059425,43.18711656441718,0.00771949388034065,0.025908506371460176,0.03362800025180083,2018-03-31,20:00:02,Saturday,5,8,39,8,38,49,328,6,97,2,0,3,13,0,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.7231080068770375,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

The Canadian finished the Australian leg of his Boy Meets World tour Monday night with a sold out show at Rod Laver Arena in front of 15,000 fans.

And some of those fans went to water as Drake was escorted through the terminal surrounded by body guards and Qantas staff to his first class seat bound for Los Angeles.

His white bodyguard covered in ink took umbrage to our cameras but we explained our position which appeared fine.

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-squids-outsmart-their-predators-carly-anne-york

There are about 500 species of squid, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source for whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish - and even other squid. As a result, the squid's most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved to help them thwart these predators. Carly Anne York explains how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered deep sea survival.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

In 2015 the Court of Justice of the European  Union (CJEU) has overturned the EU-US data sharing system called „Safe Harbor“ over US mass surveillance, as disclosed by Edward Snowden. Only months later the European Commission agreed with the US government to replace it with the so-called “Privacy Shield”, despite the existence of PRISM and Upstream surveillance. Why the new deal is nothing but the old “Safe Harbor”, what we can learn for the documents exchanged between the EU and the US and why it will very likely be overturned as soon as it reached the CJEU again.

Born in Syracuse in 1995 but raised in Grapevine, TX, Austin Richard Post has grown up to become one of the most powerful creative forces in pop culture today—as well as the most misunderstood. Is the artist who came in the game as “White Iverson” a rapper? A rock star? A psycho? None of the above? With his ‘Beerbongs and Bentleys’ album dropping this Friday, what better time to dig deep into the artist’s soul? MASS APPEAL pulled up to the fast food restaurant where he used to work, spoke with teachers, classmates, family members, and Dre London, the manager who’s been rocking with him since his first SoundCloud upload. From Post’s friendship with the late Bankroll Fresh to how he deals with haters, this new doc offers a rare glimpse of a Rockstar on the rise.

EMPIRE returns at a new time on Wednesday, Sept. 27 (8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX. On the Season Four premiere, Lucious makes his first public appearance after the explosion in Las Vegas, while all members of the Lyon family have their own interests in Lucious regaining his physical and mental faculties. Academy Award- and Golden Globe-winning actor, director and producer Forest Whitaker (“The Last King of Scotland,” “Arrival,” “Lee Daniels’ The Butler”) will guest-star in a multi-episode arc on EMPIRE, beginning this fall on FOX. Whitaker will play “Uncle Eddie,” a charismatic music icon and bonafide hitmaker, who gave an unknown Lucious (Terrence Howard) his first radio airplay. Decades later, Eddie steps up for Lucious at a critical moment during his rehabilitation, and a grateful Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) invites him to produce a song in celebration of Empire Entertainment’s 20th anniversary.

EMPIRE is a powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world of hip-hop music. The show revolves around the Lyon family and their media company, Empire Entertainment. The founder, LUCIOUS LYON (Terrence Howard), is the king of hip-hop, but his company and reign are constantly threatened by his family, including his ex-wife, COOKIE LYON (Taraji P. Henson); his sons, JAMAL (Jussie Smollett), HAKEEM (Bryshere “Yazz” Gray) and ANDRE (Trai Byers); and a volatile and competitive music industry.

The Game Awards 2017 is happening very soon. Nominated for Game of the Year 2017 are PUBG, Super Mario Oddysey, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5 and Horizon Zero Dawn, but who will actually win GOTY? Hideo Kojima and others have been confirmed to make an appearance, so here are my final thoughts and predictions on all the nominees, winners, and new games and trailers!

I still can't believe that they thought a baby product like that would be popular, no wonder it was discontinued! Join me as I unbox and review some of the strangest products we could find from Shark Tank, a TV show where they review and rate products... pretty much like what I do, but fancier ;) Today I'll be looking at the products that THEY funded, from hilarious candles to a strange back pain relief tool, and I'll help you decide if they are actually worth buying! I hope you enjoy!

Mr. Rogers was a one of a kind man. For this list, we’ll be looking at all those heartwarming moments that made Fred Rogers such a huge influence in so many children’s’ lives. He introduced us to everything from astronauts to gorillas to crayons to puppets.!We’ve included the time when he showed us how to make crayons, when he said goodbye, when he talked about divorce, when he met Koko the gorilla, when he talked about violence and shootings, when he buried a pet fish, when he sang with Jeff Erlanger and when he defended PBS to the senate.

Soon after the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal (1970) qualifier was held, the first stage (the quarterfinals) of the Candidates matches was held in four cities in May 1971. In Vancouver, Canada there was a 10 game match between Mark Taimanov and Bobby Fischer, played May 16th - June 1st.
Fischer sensationally won the match with a perfect score of 6-0, thereby proceeding to the Fischer - Larsen Candidates Semifinal (1971).

After the event, Taimanov was famously reported to have said, ""At least I still have my music."" He wasn't being merely melodramatic: the consequences of this loss were to haunt him for years. Taimanov later recounted in an interview with Joel Lautier:

""Until the match with Fischer in 1971, everything went smoothly in my chess career. This dramatic match changed my life into hell.""

""As Fischer himself admitted at the time, the final score did not reflect the true balance of strength. The terrible feeling that I was playing against a machine which never made any mistake shattered my resistance. Fischer would never concede any weakening of his position, he was an incredibly tough defender. The third game proved to be the turning point of the match. After a pretty tactical sequence, I had managed to set my opponent serious problems. In a position that I considered to be winning, I could not find a way to break through his defenses. For every promising idea, I found an answer for Fischer, I engrossed myself in a very deep think which did not produce any positive result. Frustrated and exhausted, I avoided the critical line in the end and lost the thread of the game, which lead to my defeat eventually. Ten years later, I found at last how I should have won that fatal game, but unfortunately, it didn't matter anymore! I have written a book about this match, entitled How I Became Fischer's Victim, it represents an essay on the American player and describes how I perceived his style and personality, once the match was over.""

""The sanctions from the Soviet government were severe. I was deprived of my civil rights, my salary was taken away from me, I was prohibited from travelling abroad and censored in the press. It was unthinkable for the authorities that a Soviet grandmaster could lose in such a way to an American, without a political explanation. I therefore became the object of slander and was accused, among other things, of secretly reading books of Solzhenitsin. I was banned from society for two years, it was also the time when I separated from my first wife, Lyubov Bruk.""

Also there was a situation that took place that needed to be addressed towards the end of the video. The review last until 19:43 if you want to skip the convo.

Well, it had a good run.  Although Laserdisc could never really get off the ground, it had a reasonable showing in the high end video market.  Intended as a mass market product, Laserdisc would never get there.
But DVD... well that's a whole other story.  In 7 or 8 years, DVD went from being introduced to being everywhere, and it is still selling pretty well in the face of streaming services such as Netflix.  Just how long DVD can cling to life remains to be seen, but you can still stroll on into any big box store and pick up a DVD player and some movies to go with it.
This video tells how DVD got started, and why it was able to succeed where Laserdisc failed.

This is a comparison video to show the difference in edge and sharpness quality between hand sharpening whetstones vs electric sharpener. Japanese knife owners should learn to sharpen their knives on whetstones, and if you don't have time, or don't care about having the sharpest knife, then electric sharpeners will work just fine. I prefer to have the absolute sharpest edge possible for my knives, so whetstone hand sharpening is the only method I use.

LYRICS:

Verse 1 //
You’re my always You’re my forever You’re my reality
You’re my sunshine You’re my best times You’re my anomaly

Pre-Chorus //
And I’d choose you
In a hundred lifetimes I’d choose you
In a hundred worlds I’d find You...

Chorus //
And I’d say, “I do”
For the rest of my life, with all that I have, I do
And I will
When the sky is falling, I promise you I’m all in,
No turning back.
Every day, every moment, Every breath you take...I choose you.

Verse 2 //
This is more than just a wedding, This is etched into eternity.
With our union, We will move mountains, We will live on our knees

Pre-Chorus //
And He’d choose us
In a hundred lifetimes
He’d choose us
In a hundred worlds He’d find us...

Chorus //
And we’d say, “We do”
For the rest of our lives, with all that we have we do
And we will
Until the sun turns black Until He comes back
Riding on the clouds
Every day, every moment, Every breath we take, We’ll choose You.

Bridge //
Look into my eyes dear
This is where it starts
I'll give you my whole heart for my whole life.

Chorus //
And I say, “I do”
For the rest of my life With all that I have, I do And I will
When the sky is falling, I promise you I’m all in,
No turning back.
Every day, every moment, Every breath you take...
I choose you.

Why you tryna hold me back? (I ain't)
I’m just tryna move up front
Lil more of this, lil less of that (Can you feel me?)
Let me come through (Let me come through)

But I made a good good thing out of bad bad news

A music documentary on Ashanti was highly requested, so I had to do it. Ashanti is a multi-platinum selling R&B singer and songwriter who is most known for her top hits ""Foolish"", ""Always on Time"", and ""Rock Wit U."" Ashanti still holds the world record of having the fastest selling debut album by a female artist (her album ""Ashanti"" sold 503,000 in the first week). She is the first female artist to have all 3 of her debut songs peak to the top ten Billboard charts, simultaneously. Ashanti's rapid rise to success was followed by a huge obstacle. Her music label Murda Inc, faced several setbacks, including being investigated by the government and being ridiculed by 50 Cent and G-Unit. Ultimately the issues with her label contributed to Ashanti's fall from the top spot.

Beauty and the Beast is a 2017 American musical romantic fantasy film directed by Bill Condon from a screenplay written by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, and co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Mandeville Films. The film is based on Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name, itself an adaptation of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's eighteenth-century fairy tale.

Some of you may be concerned about the final step here where we said the circle approaches a line.  What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then ""add subtitles/cc"".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.

안녕하세요
오늘은 아주 진~한 초콜릿 케이크 레시피를 준비했어요
가나슈를 뿌려 더 진하고 달콤합니다 :-0
선물하기도 괜찮고 티 푸드로 딱이예요 (선물용으론 코코아가루 뿌리기 X)

▶재료 (26cm x 8cm 장 파운드 팬)

케이크 - 버터 120g, 설탕 100g, 계란 2개, 바닐라 익스트랙 4ml, 녹인 다크 초콜릿 100g,
박력분 120g, 코코아가루 15g, 베이킹파우더 2g, 우유 50ml
가나슈 - 다크 초콜릿 160g, 생크림 100ml
기타 - 코코아가루 15g

1) 오븐을 170도로 예열하고 초콜릿은 중탕이나 전자레인지로 녹여둡니다
2) 볼에 버터를 넣고 잘 풀어준 다음 설탕을 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다
3) 계란을 1개씩 넣어가며 섞어주고 바닐라도 넣어줍니다 (분리가 되어도 괜찮아요)
4) 녹인 다크 초콜릿을 넣고 섞어줍니다
5) 박력분, 코코아가루, 베이킹파우더를 체쳐 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다
6) 우유를 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다
7) 준비한 틀에 반죽을 채워 예열된 오븐에 구워줍니다 (170도 40~45분) 꼬치테스트
8) 케이크가 완전히 식으면 틀에서 분리합니다 (억지로 빼내면 갈라져요)
9) 가나슈 재료들을 데워 섞어줍니다
10) 케이크위에 부어줍니다
11) 가나슈가 굳도록 1시간 이상 그대로 둡니다
12) 코코아 가루를 뿌려 마무리 합니다

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다
시청해주셔서 감사합니다

Along the way, I got to meet up with my aunt that I haven’t seen for years. Got to visit her kitty, and it’s been 8 years since that… I could remember the first time I met kiki, she was very youthful and energetic. Seeing her gave me a stark reminder of how times flies, and how things change.

Tokyo was wonderful- you might see that Claire and I are kind of glossy (SWEATY) in the vlogs. It was mid august, so it was so SO hot everyday. I’m glad that didn’t get in the way of us having fun! Thank you to Claire for being an amazing, fun travel companion, and her dad for saving our asses when I totally forgot to book a bnb for one of the nights!

Thank you, too, for being here for me to share my stories with. For those in the midst of finals- wish you all the best of luck! Many of us are in the throws of stress right now, or always feeling intimidated. I hope you can find a way to see the big picture, to try to live so each day is the best it could have been, for your own happiness. Life isn’t worth struggling and suffering through your days- there are certainly things at the top of our to-do list, but your health and happiness comes first.


Sending you love and happiness, until next time,
Annabelle

Yo Herc! Old time fan here

Just wanted to point out to you the fact that you talk way too negatively about prison. Prison doesn't have to be necessarily a bad thing. I advise you to look at your stint in prison as a good experience, rather than as a bad experience, because, if you somehow had managed to rob that bank you attempted to, you would have probably continued wild, crime ridden lifestyle you once led. Maybe, if you didn't get busted in 1999, maybe you would have killed someone in the outside world in 2003, and caught a life sentence? Or maybe you yourself would have been killed? Also, without your prison time, today we wouldn't have Fresh Out. So, l would argue that the fact that you spent 8 years of your life in Feds actually helped you in staying alive and/or free today. Don't reminiscent about prison as a bad thing because that experience made you the person you are today. Maybe if you stop seeing prison as a bad experience, maybe your nightmares about it will cease. 
Anyways, excuse my long ass e-mail and my grammar, English isn't my mother language so l may have made a couple of grammatical errors in this letter to you.
Keep up the amazing work you're doing.

1) ‘Wonder Woman 2’: Patty Jenkins Teases A New Love Story and New Characters

2) Walt Disney Studios Crosses $5 Billion at Global Box Office Again; Infinity War Now Most Viewed Trailer of All Time

3) Aaron Sorkin reveals story structure for Lucille Ball biopic

4) ‘Hellboy’ Reboot to Arrive in Early 2019

5) ‘Logan’ Director James Mangold to Helm Giant Cat Story ‘Crenshaw’

6) New trailer released for Paddington 2

7) Mail Bag

While Wonder Woman 2’s November 1, 2019 release date is still two years away, production on the film is slowly taking shape and will begin at some point next year.  Director Patty Jenkins is currently in the midst of an awards push for Wonder Woman, and appearing on Variety’s Playback podcast, the filmmaker offered a small tease of what we can expect from the sequel.

BUY OR SELL

Walt Disney Studios announced yesterday that the company has officially passed the $5 billion mark at the annual global box office, marking the third year in a row to do so and the first and only time a studio has reached the threshold three times.

As part of an in-depth profile on screenwriter/director Aaron Sorkin, THR revealed that his Lucille Ball biopic, tentatively titled Lucy and Desi, will take place against the backdrop of a single production week on the television series I Love Lucy.

THR reports that Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment’s Hellboy reboot has officially been dated for January 11, 2019, missing the 25th anniversary of the Mike Mignola created comic book by about a year.

According to THR, Fox is developing an adaptation of the book Crenshaw, with Logan director James Mangold signing on to direct. The children's book by Newbery-winning author Katherine Applegate tells the story of Jackson, a young boy whose family has fallen on hard times, at which point his imaginary friend — a giant cat named Crenshaw — comes back in to Jackson's life to offer some help.

A new trailer has been released for Paddington 2. The sequel follows the adorable Paddington working odd jobs to make enough money to buy an antique pop-up book for his Aunt Lucy.

This bin collects garbage from the sea. Seabin has a pump that creates a flow of water.  The garbage is caught in a bag, allowing water to flow out back to sea.

2. This machine crushes beer bottles into usable sand. 200 grams of powder form each bottle is recycled to preserve beaches. 

3. SaltWater Brewery created edible packaging to save sea life. The six-pack rings are made of barley and wheat. Sea life can eat the rings safely. 

4. AIR-INK can turn air pollution into ink. it collects carbon soot from a car's exhaust. Then it is processed into a high-quality black ink.

5. These edible water blobs are biodegradable. The capsule is made from a seaweed extract. A greener solution to creating waste-free packaging.

6. This ""Ocean Cleanup"" machine has a giant floating pipe to capture plastic. The pipe moves with the waves and has floating anchors. The plastic is a; gathered in the center for a boat to remove.

7. Avani's biodegradable bags are saving sea life and reducing ocean pollution. They are made from cassava root and natural starches. Making them harmless for animal consumption. 

8. This machine recycles tires. They are turned into rubber crumb for artificial grass. 

9. Aquaponics combines fish farming and hydroponics. As the fish eat and grow they produce waste. The wastewater is given to plants as a fertilizer. The plants absorb the nutrients in the water and they are returned to the fish tanks. A natural process to growing food. 

10. HomeBiogas 2.0 turns food scraps into cooking gas. The gas flows from the system directly to the kitchen stove. 
It can be fed up to six liters of waste and digest almost anything. HomeBiogas can also create fertilizer that goes back into soil.

I get a little emotional on tips 3 and 4, just FYI! 1. Dealing with gas and bloating on a vegan diet. Tips from my own experience, as well as from Mic the Vegan and Dr. Gregor. 2. How easy it is to switch to a plant based diet! A whole foods plant based diet can be simple, even when traveling if you keep it simple and try to be prepared. 3. I never realized how much the animals would change my life! I went vegan for my health, I've stayed vegan for the animals. 4. If you're looking for a sense of purpose, need a confidence boost, new hobby or passion project, go vegan! I'm telling you, it's majorly increased my self esteem and my sense of purpose because I make informed choices every single day that I can feel good about it. Hope you enjoy this video and let me know if you've had similar experiences :)

On the other hand, the new BlackBerry Motion packs a huge battery, a larger screen and some of the best security in the Android world – on top of being the first water- and dust-resistant BlackBerry ever. How much does that matter in light of the loss of its halo feature? Depends on how badly you need a physical keyboard. Join MrMobile for a rare comparison video: BlackBerry Motion vs BlackBerry KEYone, aka ""A Tale Of Two BlackBerrys.""

Lyrics:

[Hard Feelings]

(Go back and tell it)

Please could you be tender
And I will sit close to you
Let’s give it a minute before we admit that we’re through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I’m at Jungle City, it’s late and this song is for you

Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go

Hard feelings—
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed ya when you told me this was my home

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you’ve outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It’s time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don’t need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we’d drift buying groceries, how you’d dance for me
I’ll start letting go of little things 'til I’m so far away from you, far away from you, yeah",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6nYF3juDQY/sddefault.jpg,0.013972153680183915,0.00015581253313938422,89.67284851010628,0.0001854230833004841,0.0141279662133233,0.014313389296623784,2018-01-19,05:38:16,Friday,4,4,1,4,1,21,2,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.3133624729300575,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,{'person': 2},2

After tranquilizing it with a powerful opioid, the team worked to trip the animal. Once on the ground, a veterinarian removed the wire and gave a few shots, including anti-parasitic medicine and a vitamin injection. Workers from the sanctuary report that the giraffe appears to be doing well and in good health.

About Video Game Sophistry:
Video Game Sophistry is an opportunity to celebrate the creators and the artistry found in Video Games. I believe that Games are the most effective medium from experiencing another world, and another way to live. Expect to see a series of videos showcasing the narratives hidden in every game, interviews with game developers, along with our bench mark weekly podcast, Dialogue Wheel. 

Andy Borkowski started this program nearly 10 years ago and, in that time, it has changed from a simple YouTube show, to a radio show, a tv show and now once again a YouTube destination. Welcome to VGS.

Prince Harry and his family are no strangers to the spotlight, and now he's given the world yet another fairy tale to follow in the news. In May 2018, the prince modernized the palace by marrying Meghan Markle, an American actress whose previous marriage and divorce challenged the cookie-cutter expectations of a royal wedding. Making matters even more headline-worthy, however, was the fact that some of Markle's family members came out of the woodwork to create their own media circus ahead of the couple's nuptial date. Buckingham Palace may be notoriously good about controlling the narrative surrounding the royal family, but Markle's relatives offered up some new challenges. Here are just some of the stories that the royals probably didn't want you to hear about Meghan Markle's family...

Where Joe is casual, Joan is elegant. Where Joe is vain, Joan is self-effacing. And where Joe enjoys his very public role as Great American Novelist, Joan pours her considerable intellect, grace, charm, and diplomacy into the private role of Great Man’s Wife.

Joe is about to be awarded the Nobel Prize for his acclaimed and prolific body of work. Joe’s literary star has blazed since he and Joan first met in the late 1950’s. THE WIFE interweaves the story of the couple’s youthful passion and ambition with a portrait of a marriage, thirty-plus years later—a lifetime’s shared compromises, secrets, betrayals, and mutual love.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

Tumbleweeds might be the iconic props of classic Westerns. But in real life, they’re not only a noxious weed, but one that moves around.  Pushed by gusts of wind, they can overwhelm entire neighborhoods, as happened recently in Victorville, California, or become a threat for drivers and an expensive nuisance for farmers. 

“They tumble across highways and can cause accidents,” said Mike Pitcairn, who tracks tumbleweeds at the California Department of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento. “They pile up against fences and homes.”

And tumbleweeds aren’t even originally from the West.

Genetic tests have shown that California’s most common tumbleweed, known as Russian thistle, likely came from Ukraine, said retired plant population biologist Debra Ayres, who studied tumbleweeds at the University of California, Davis.

A U.S. Department of Agriculture employee, L. H. Dewey, wrote in 1893 that Russian thistle had arrived in the U.S. through South Dakota in flaxseed imported from Europe in the 1870s.

“It has been known in Russia many years,” Dewey wrote, “and has quite as bad a reputation in the wheat regions there as it has in the Dakotas.” This is where the name Russian thistle originates, said Ayres, although tumbleweeds aren’t thistles.

The weed spread quickly through the United States — on rail cars, through contamination of agricultural seeds and by tumbling.
“They tumble to disperse the seeds,” said Ayres, “and thereby reduce competition.”
A rolling tumbleweed spreads out tens of thousands of seeds so that they all get plenty of sunlight and space. 

Tumbleweeds grow well in barren places like vacant lots or the side of the road, where they can tumble unobstructed and there’s no grass, which their seedlings can’t compete with.

--- Where does a tumbleweed come from?

Tumbleweeds start out attached to the soil. Seedlings, which look like blades of grass, sprout at the end of winter. By summer, Russian thistle plants take on their round shape and grow flowers. Inside each flower, a fruit with a seed develops.
Other plants attract animals with tasty fruits, and get them to carry away their seeds and disperse them when they poop.
Tumbleweeds developed a different evolutionary strategy. Starting in late fall, they dry out and die, their seeds nestled between prickly leaves. Gusts of wind easily break dead tumbleweeds from their roots and they roll away, spreading their seeds as they go.

--- How big do tumbleweeds grow?

Mike Pitcairn, of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said that in the state’s San Joaquin Valley they can grow to be more than 6 feet tall.

--- Are tumbleweeds dangerous?

Yes. They can cause traffic accidents or be a fire hazard if they pile up near buildings.

Following is a transcript of the video:

Did you know that cannibalism used to be a popular medical remedy?

That’s right! In the 17th century, well before Advil Europeans would ingest ground up mummies for headaches. And human fat, blood, and bone were used to treat everything from gout to nosebleeds. 

Yet cannibalism is largely absent and morally frowned upon in today. But let’s forget the social quagmire. There are plenty of reasons why you shouldn’t eat people these days.

For starters, we now know that human meat is a surprisingly low source of calories compared to other red meat. According to one study human muscle contains about 1,300 calories per kilogram. That’s less than beef and nothing compared to bear and boar meat.

Now, you might think this would actually make human burgers a great low-cal alternative until you remember you’re probably trying to eat humans because you’re starving to death. So, low-cal is the opposite of what you want.

Plus it’s not worth taking the risk — if you can help it. Turns out, we carry some pretty nasty diseases that make 24-hour food poisoning look like the sniffles. Eat someone raw, and you risk contracting any blood-borne diseases they carried.

But even if you cook the meat, it still won’t always go well for you. Case in point are the Fore people of Papua New Guinea. They would eat the body and brain of deceased family members out of cultural tradition. But that practice stopped after hundreds of people died in the 1950s and ‘60s from an otherwise rare neurological disorder which they contracted from eating infected human brains.

Turns out, the brain tissue contained prions — deadly misfolded proteins that form spongy holes in your brain. They survive the cooking process and, if eaten, are highly contagious.

On the legal side of things, cannibalism falls into a gray area. Oddly enough, cannibalism itself is not illegal in the US or UK, but you probably committed some crime along the way to get that slab of meat.

Grave robbing, desecration of a corpse, murder, or maybe all of the above?

One exception that won’t put you behind bars, is if you eat … yourself! Yup, that’s a thing. It’s called autocannibalism.

The most common example today, called placentophagy, is when a woman eats her placenta after giving birth. The idea is that it can raise energy levels and reduce the risk of postpartum depression by stabilizing hormones. But the science is still out on whether there’s any real benefit.

Regardless, this ancient practice has recently found new life in Western culture. Kim Kardashian and Alicia Silverstone have reportedly done it. And there are numerous US companies that will grind your placenta into a powder so you can take it like any other vitamin supplement. 

But the CDC warns that even this cutting-edge form of cannibalism is a bad idea. Because it can transfer harmful bacteria from mother to child. 

So, if you have a hankering for human, maybe try some pork instead. After all — that’s what we taste like. Wait … we obviously mean: ACCORDING TO CANNIBALS ANYWAYS!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAY7k0DPIuU/sddefault.jpg,0.014733220911260484,0.0011241420896728027,13.106190975865688,0.0030143050324762644,0.015857363000933284,0.01887166803340955,2018-06-03,21:00:04,Sunday,6,5,20,5,18,36,208,1,46,0,1,5,4,1,0,6.0,9.0,"['SCIENCE', 'INSIDER']","['SCIENCE', 'INSIDER']",True,"['scienc', 'insid']",2,2,11,0,0,0,0,6.244809505770588,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Let’s see how many you already use…

1. Pulse grenade to push you quickly towards the safe zone.
2. Parachute deploys at it’s lowest away from the island.
3. If you’re a covert player attempt to enter the safe zones from the smallest side.
4. Running towards gunfire in the distance...
5. Get used to the unique sounds of each weapon…
6. Throw a trap in the top of your base to warn off any would be base rushers.
7. Placing traps at the foot of the base to catch those snooping below
8. And one more way to use traps on your bases is by putting them inside.
9. Most people use metal and brick for final bases. This makes complete sense as they are the stronger materials but many people miss how weak they are during the first few seconds of the build. Wood on the other hand has immediate integrity and can take the brunt of a shotgun blast and still stay intact. Whereas metal is smashed to pieces immediately.
10. With bigger trees try to keep the last 50 health in tact and move to the next one.
11. Palettes, rock formations, huge pine trees… the beast trees at moisty are great too.
12. There’s a small glitch which can be used when gathering materials.
13. Building ramps above your head when climbing high can save your life.
14. you can peak through the slats in the structure and get the drop on the enemy.
15. edit your structures
16. sniper window
17. Hit a wall a few times to see through the top layer
18. Never stand still
19.  Stone covers.
20. Sky Bridge security
21.  fall damage
22.  spam the ramp in the hopes of negating any fall damage.
23.  If you’re trying to make an impossible jump use the roof tile to bridge the gap.
24. silenced weapons,  use them for checking bushes or knocking down trees and walls without giving away your position.
Don’t watch… Switch
25. immediately switching
26. Pop a ramp when fighting.
27. rifle can snipe through the cracks in some structures.
28. Switch to your axe while looting
29. Loot Trap
30. the effects of the campfires stack
31. Keep weapons in the same slots
32. check the patch notes!
33. By changing the pyramid structure to a ramp we are able to minimize the number of clicks needed to build.
34. Use console aim assist to check bushes for wookies.
35. Buttons can be reassigned on console",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAmKwRiyj9Y/sddefault.jpg,0.012976040590750231,0.0005805639330517391,22.350752177355503,0.0011248138908769641,0.013556604523801972,0.014681418414678937,2018-03-14,19:00:04,Wednesday,2,11,54,11,38,66,411,1,70,0,2,6,2,3,9,5.0,7.0,"['i', '', 'i s:', '', 'BATTLE ROYAL', ', av ea', 'ST) Py }', '', 'yy', '', 'es', 'o 4 .']","['i', 'i', 's:', 'BATTLE', 'ROYAL', ',', 'av', 'ea', 'ST)', 'Py', '}', 'yy', 'es', 'o', '4', '.']",True,"['i', 'i', 's', ':', 'battl', 'royal', ',', 'av', 'ea', 'ST', ')', 'Py', '}', 'yy', 'es', 'o', '4', '.']",18,17,32,5,1,1,4,5.565307866171267,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Entering its seventh season, hit culinary competition series MASTERCHEF JUNIOR gives talented kids between the ages of 8 and 13 the chance to showcase their culinary abilities and passion for food through a series of delicious challenges.

Award-winning chef Gordon Ramsay and renowned pastry chef Christina Tosi will be joined by celebrated chef and restaurateur Aarón Sánchez on the judges’ panel. Season Seven will showcase a mystery box challenge focusing on the most important meal of the day – breakfast. Additionally, the young chef-testants will attend and prepare a meal for 51 circus performers, create a restaurant-quality fish dish, compete to see which team can first roll out a perfect sheet of pasta to 24 feet and power through the fan-favorite pop-up restaurant challenge, until one talented kid is named America’s newest MASTERCHEF JUNIOR, taking home the MASTERCHEF JUNIOR trophy and $100,000 grand prize.

[Chorus]
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains it pours
I don't know how to wish anymore (keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (keep on wishin')
Or do I?
Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, R.I.P. Kurt Cobain
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face

[Verse]
I wish you would find your chill
'Cause Lord knows this *** gets real
And for this price, you know you'd kill
Man, this big brackin', know the deal
Man, this big slatt, you know the deal
Draco on big dragon fire hell
Can't save me, man, save yourself
'Cause I do not need no help

[Bridge]
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Ooh, ohh, ahh

[Chorus]
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains it pours
I don't know how to wish anymore (keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (keep on wishin')
Or do I?
Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, R.I.P Kurt Cobain
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
Baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains it pours
I don't know how to wish anymore
I don't know how to wish anymore
Or do I?

Now, although the sisters must face off against each other, nothing can shake their unbreakable bond.

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to the royal family, they follow a lot of traditional etiquette rules that may seem strange to us. This also extends to their beauty and fashion, and some of the regulations are surprisingly strict. We’ll let you know what article of clothing the Queen would never be spotted without, and why Meghan Markle wearing ripped jeans caused such a stir. There’s a reason that you won’t see Kate Middleton wearing bright nail polish, and we’ll tell you what she prefers to put on her nails instead. Although some of the rules may seem arbitrary, there are good reasons for lots of them. We’ll explain why royal women choose clutches over purses, lipstick over lip gloss, and what special addition they make to their hems. Do you think that these rules are a good idea, or are they extremely outdated? Let us know in the comment section and then click subscribe for more videos from TheTalko.

www.frozenthemusical.com

Frozen has joined Disney Theatrical hits Aladdin and The Lion King on Broadway, playing at the historic St. James Theatre. The new Broadway musical opened on Thursday, March 22, and has already set box office records, prompting Variety to declare, “Frozen sizzles!” 
 
“Disney’s struck gold! Sumptuous sets, gorgeous costumes and plenty of special effects to wow the audience!” raves the New York Post. The New Yorker calls Frozen “thrilling” and “genuinely moving” and applauds its “inspired stagecraft,” and The Telegraph declares, “Frozen will burn up Broadway for years to come!”
 
“Frozen's songs shine!” exclaims the Daily News. People writes that the dozen new songs by Oscar®-winning songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez “blend seamlessly with favorites like ‘Love Is an Open Door’ and ‘For the First Time in Forever,’” from “Elsa’s earth-shattering anthem ‘Monster’” to “Anna’s 11 o’clock heartbreaker ‘True Love’” that, as performed by the “bright and beautiful” Patti Murin, “will have you reaching for the tissues.” New York magazine describes Caissie Levy as Elsa “belting her heart out as if she’s Lady Gaga at Madison Square Garden – and the response in the audience is comparable. There are screams, cheers, tears – this is what we came for, and the effect is genuinely electric.” 

Frozen’s director is Michael Grandage, a Tony Award® winner (Red) and director of three Olivier Award-winning Outstanding Musicals (Merrily We Roll Along, Grand Hotel and Guys and Dolls), and Rob Ashford, Tony Award winner (Thoroughly Modern Millie) and multiple Tony and Olivier Award nominee, is choreographer.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dENk6wVYfT0/sddefault.jpg,0.009407202447357007,0.00022033634923543285,42.694736842105264,0.0006772443576499621,0.009627538796592441,0.010304783154242405,2018-05-16,14:07:58,Wednesday,2,7,5,7,5,41,55,4,16,4,0,2,5,1,0,5.0,10.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.348974647667763,4,"['happy', 'angry', 'happy', 'happy']",1,0,0,3,0,0,0,{'person': 16},16

Katharine Graham is the first female publisher of a major American newspaper -- The Washington Post. With help from editor Ben Bradlee, Graham races to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spans three decades and four U.S. presidents. Together, they must overcome their differences as they risk their careers -- and very freedom -- to help bring long-buried truths to light.

This video will explain why hunger won't get worse and worse while fasting and why keeping your blood glucose and insulin low & why trying a keto diet will help you adapt to fasting a lot easier. 

When I first started doing intermittent fasting, handling the hunger was quite difficult. I tried several things to try and make myself less hungry without breaking the fast, but what was most helpful was knowing that it would go away on its own, and why this was the case. So, I hope that this video helps those of you trying out prolonged or intermittent fasting - hunger is pretty much inescapable, there is going to be some level of discomfort when trying out fasting, but it's very encouraging to know that things will change and hunger will naturally go away. 

Sections:
0:59 - Why hunger is rhythmic & doesn't just get stronger over time
3:13 - Why low Salt may be cause of your hunger while fasting
5:00 - How Insulin works
5:36 - How Glucagon works
6:10 - Insulin Makes you Hungry, Glucagon doesn't
7:51 - Ketones/Ketosis & Hunger
9:27 - Why you shouldn't go overboard on protein
9:59 - Letpin, the satiety hormone

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dG5Z_RIvAr8/sddefault.jpg,0.015395864480445741,0.0002627931232622294,58.585492227979266,0.0006072835905438047,0.01565865760370797,0.016265941194251773,2017-12-14,06:14:56,Thursday,3,6,38,6,33,40,334,2,79,0,1,4,14,1,0,6.0,8.0,"['pa aad', 'eo i', '', 'ess', '', 'Parts']","['pa', 'aad', 'eo', 'i', 'ess', 'Parts']",True,"['pa', 'aad', 'eo', 'i', 'ess', 'part']",6,6,15,0,0,0,1,5.4504150796553015,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

A shuriken (""hidden hand blade"") is a Japanese concealed weapon that was used as a hidden dagger or metsubushi to distract or misdirect.

Shuriken came in a variety of forms; some were manufactured, while others were improvised from tools. The edges of shuriken were often sharpened, so they could be used to penetrate skin or open arteries.

Shuriken are commonly known in the West as throwing stars or ninja stars although they were originally designed in many different shapes. The major varieties of shuriken are the bō shuriken (stick shuriken) and the hira shuriken ( flat shuriken) or shaken.

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. 

While her song ""Devil Devil"" hit success, it wasn't until her anthem ""Quiet"" made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. 

With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dGIWAuVzOt4/sddefault.jpg,0.01770519701531614,0.00037635816206309724,47.04347826086956,0.0007036261290744862,0.01808155517737924,0.018785181306453725,2018-01-19,05:03:43,Friday,4,9,44,9,41,46,309,4,55,2,2,6,12,4,8,4.0,6.0,"['RIOT Ti', '', 'Ic', 'OAD INU', '', 'THIS,']","['RIOT', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'OAD', 'INU', 'THIS,']",True,"['riot', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'oad', 'inu', 'thi', ',']",7,7,18,1,0,2,0,6.2043957208298295,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

The all-new Silverado sets the course for the next century of Chevy Trucks with the most functional bed of any full-size truck, weighs up to 450 pounds less for increased performance and offers a broad range of trims and engine/transmission combinations to help each customer find their ideal truck.

The 2019 Silverado is larger than before, including a wheelbase that is up to 3.9 inches (100 mm) longer and an overall length that is 1.6 inches (41 mm) longer, enabling both more cargo volume and more interior room for all cab lengths. Remarkably, it’s also lighter, weighing 450 pounds (204 kg) less than today’s truck when comparing crew cab V-8 models.

The weight savings comes from extensive use of mixed materials and advanced manufacturing processes throughout the next-gen truck. This allowed Chevrolet to use the right material for the application and optimize every component for mass, durability, safety and functionality to meet our customers’ needs.

For example, the body is 88 pounds (40 kg) lighter than before due to mixed materials use. All exterior swing panels (doors, hood and tailgate) are made of aluminum while fixed panels (fenders, roof and bed) are made of steel. The underlying safety cage uses seven different grades of steel, each tailored for the specific application.

The fully boxed steel frame is also 88 pounds (40 kg) lighter than its predecessor, while offering 10 percent greater torsional rigidity. Eighty percent of the frame is made of high-strength steel varying from 2 to 5 millimeters in thickness, and every millimeter is optimized for performance using a variety of processes, including hydroforming, roll forming, conventional stamping and tailor-rolled blanking. As a result, frame sections, gauges, grades, processes and materials strategically vary to maximize strength, durability and stiffness without adding unnecessary mass.

Mixed materials also play a part in the all-new suspension. The front independent short/long arm suspension features new forged-aluminum upper control arms that are lighter and provide better wheel alignment than the stamped component they replace. The live-axle rear suspension is also redesigned, including new carbon-composite second-stage springs on LT models that save about 12 pounds (5 kg) per side over the steel springs they replace.

The 2019 Silverado will be available with six engine/transmission combinations, giving customers more combinations of performance, efficiency and value to best fit their priorities. This includes new 5.3L and 6.2L V-8s with industry-first Dynamic Fuel Management that actively shuts off any number of cylinders, in a variety of combinations, depending on immediate needs to optimize fuel economy. The result of this industry-first technology is instant power when called for, and impressive efficiency.

The Silverado will also be available with an all-new Duramax 3.0L inline-six turbo-diesel. Chevrolet offers diesel engines in more segments and models than any other brand, including Equinox, Cruze, Colorado, Express, Silverado 1500, Silverado HD and upcoming Silverado medium-duty models.  

Both the 3.0L diesel and 6.2L engines are paired with a new Hydra-Matic 10-speed automatic transmission as well as start/stop technology to improve fuel economy for optimum performance and efficiency.

MD knows what the audience wants and heMs appealing to it very well, the music video is already touching stupid numbers and getting plays on the airwaves so I think it’s safe to say he has ‘another one’ 

Simple but very catchy, definitely one for everyone to get gassed off whether it be in the clubs or live! 
Imagine seeing the whole crowd not dancing 😂
Have to respect the promo for this too as he was getting the help from the big stars across the world, it’s all mad.
The UK scene is the wave to be on now and we love how he has involved a lot of the biggest UK influencers within the video! From Yung Filly, KSI, to the director (Daps) Marvs Brown with the dope editing!

It’s mad to be witness the growth of the UK scene, big up you guys as always! We love ya’ll ❤️

Don't forget to drop us some questions for the Q&A!!

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

We also were able to get a fastpass for Flight of Passage as we were parking (which was awesome!!) so we head there first! We got a cool angle of the ride that was thought was pretty neat! Then we saw the young gorillas and the meerkats as we head to ride Dinosaur. We tried out the night vision Sony camera for the first time on the ride (full camera list is down below with links). It didn't turn out great but we'll definitely try it again! Then we head over and finally see the baby tigers and it was awesome! They were adorable! I could've watched them all day! Before we leave we head over to our Kilimanjaro Safari fastpass. We saw some giraffe, rhino, crocodiles and more. We were hoping to see the baby hippo but we didn't on this trip, maybe next time. We like the safari ride but we highly recommend checking out the Maharajah Jungle walking trial too! That's where you'll find the tigers. We hope you enjoyed all the cute baby animals in this vlog! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

This summer we want to do a 24 hour box fort challenge in the ocean so being able to make sure our box fort in the pool can work is important. this funny challenge was hard but luckily we used some fun toys and Papa Jake's box fort building skills to make it work.

Francis, during a papal visit to the St. Paul of the Cross parish outside Rome, referred to the child as Emanuele.

The boy approached the microphone during a question-and-answer session with children of the parish, according to Newsweek.

Emanuele can be seen smiling at the Pope in a video before freezing. “I can’t do it,"" he says.

The pope summoned the young boy to come to him. “Come, come to me, Emanuele,” Francis said. “Come and whisper it in my ear.”

A papal aide helped the boy up to the platform where the Holy Father sat.

Francis embraced him. Their heads touching, the pope and boy spoke privately before Emanuele returned to his seat.

After asking permission, the pope shared the boy's question with a small crowd.

“‘A little while ago my father passed away. He was a nonbeliever, but he had all four of his children baptized,"" the pope recalled the boy saying. ""He was a good man. Is dad in heaven?'”

“That man did not have the gift of faith, he wasn’t a believer, but he had his children baptized. He had a good heart.""

Francis asked the children in the crowd if they thought God would abandon a father like Emanuele’s, who was a good man.

The children shouted back: “No!""

“There, Emanuele: That is the answer,” the pope said, according to a translation provided by the Catholic News Service.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPgRi0XiXr4/sddefault.jpg,0.015517773312098191,0.0001667681172713401,93.05,0.0006003652221768242,0.015684541429369533,0.016284906651546357,2018-05-04,08:35:00,Friday,4,8,31,8,26,51,254,2,61,0,1,5,10,2,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.741721043255874,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 2, 'person': 3}",5

INGREDIENTS:
Bantha Milk / blue milkshake

250ml Skimmed Milk
2 tbsps fat free yoghurt
1 ripe banana, mashed
A few drops of natural blue food colouring (or blue algae?)
1 tsp of honey to sweeten
DIRECTIONS
Add the milk, banana, yoghurt and honey to your blender. Keep blending till combined.
Add a few drops of (natural blue food colouring) to get the correct colour. Stir well.

Old fashioned ice cream milk shake. Part drink, part dessert, they are thick and creamy and provide instant happiness. Blend up vanilla ice cream, blue milk, and a dash of vanilla to create the ultimate ice cream fountain treat.

NATURAL BLUE FOOD COLORING:
One head of red cabbage
Water
Baking Soda

Wash and cut your red cabbage up into small pieces, then add to a pot. Fill pot with water until cabbage is fully submerged, and place on medium high heat until boiling. Allow to boil for 20 minutes.

Remove from heat and strain into a bowl. Use leftover cabbage for whatever you want!

Pour purple liquid back into pot and continue to simmer until the liquid is vastly reduced, anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Be careful to watch the pot so you do not burn the liquid if it reduces too much.

Remove liquid and allow to cool. Add in a teaspoon of Baking Soda to the mixture and stir well. Keep adding small amounts of Baking Soda until the desired color is achieved. Don't add too much, as the food coloring will begin  to flavor the final product.

PORG COOKIES:
We borrowed this adorable recipe from StarWars.com and changed a couple of small things:
http://www.starwars.com/news/serve-porgin-pie-the-galaxys-cutest-thanksgiving-dessert

Before putting your porg cookies in the oven, brush them with a few drops of coconut flavoring in melted butter.

In order to make the best coloring dye, mix a few drops of vodka with brown gel food coloring. This will help the mixture dry faster and apply more evenly, and the vodka's alcoholic percentage will not be significant enough to make this alcoholic at all. You can of course use water!

The Model 3 will be the least expensive of the Tesla models, with the most basic version starting at $35,000. The one we drove had a few upgrades, like a glass dome roof and some wooden interior details. It goes for $57,500. Following is a transcript of the video.

So, here we are, Ben and Matt from Business Insider in the Tesla Model 3. This is the only Tesla we really haven't driven extensively at this point because it's so new. We picked it up in Manhattan. We've shot over to New Jersey so we can play around with things like autopilot, which is on now. This is the car driving itself. Very snappy acceleration, pretty good handling.

Just from an enthusiast point of view, it's not a boring four-door mass-market sedan. It's exciting. It's a good looking car. It is a Tesla so it has all that brand power, car of the future. Very minimalist interior, takes a little bit of getting used to. But it's striking. I think a lot of people are gonna like it. The central touch screen here controls almost all vehicle functions. So, you do need to get used to that. But, it's not gonna be unfamiliar to anyone who's been in a Tesla.

This particular vehicle is $57,500. It's not the $35,000 entry-level mass market Tesla that we've been talking about. We're sitting in the upscale version of the car. They're not even making the cheaper version of this vehicle yet. So, we're getting the best possible impression of the car we can get. We're getting nice seats. We're getting a nice leather-wrapped steering wheel. You have the nice open-grain wood here in the front. You have the beautiful, giant, panoramic roof, which doesn't open.

My immediate reaction is the complete package is very compelling. It's a heck of a lot cheaper than a Model S that might be $100,000 or a Model X SUV that could get up to around $150,000. If you want an electric car that has a lot of range, this car has about 300 miles of range on a charge. If you're just commuting, you'd be able to drive it around quite a bit during the week before you'd have to plug it in.

I think I kind of like the whole package. It has a trunk in the rear end of the car. Then, you've got a the or front trunk in the front. So, you actually get some SUV functionality. You can cram a lot of stuff into the car. So, you're not really giving up the extra cargo holding ability you would have with a SUV by buying a sedan. This is a lot of fun to drive.

I can't believe it's been seven years. I did not do this alone, there have been people helping me practice reckless optimism every step of the way. From Matt who gave me my first DSLR to Linnea, my manager and creative partner. There are too many to name, but you know who you are. With all my Harto, I thank you.

It has been a WHILE since I've seen a cover requested so much xD I'm grateful, though, because it pushed me over the edge to actually record this cover. And with my main squeeze, Jon :P 

It's crazy how similar all of our tastes our within this little community. I had that thought the other day heh. We definitely have differences, but when this song came out, it felt like all of you were like ""YOU MUST DO THIS SONG ASAP!!"" :D

It's exciting though! We love this cover, and we had a blast making it.

The 100 game was created by the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson -- who you may know for writing Alice In Wonderland under the pen name Lewis Carroll.

Carroll’s Oxford students were amazed. On February 5, 1856 he wrote in his diary: “... the trick of counting alternately up to 100, neither putting on more than 10 to the last number named, astonished them not a little.”

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The Last Jedi has stormed into theaters. The film is certainly one of the most complex films set in a galaxy far, far away so you’ll be forgiven if you didn’t catch everything on the first viewing. There’s a ton going on in the background that you may not have even noticed and we’re here to help you find them. For example, did you catch that Rey stole the Jedi books? Blink and you’ll miss it! Luke’s final reveal was actually telegraphed well in advanced in a masterful way. Supreme Leader Snoke actually has a piece of bling that harkens back to Rogue One! Speaking of bling, what were those dice that we saw a few times? Luke has a stash of trinkets at the tree on Ahch-To, one of them ties directly to Star Wars Battlefront 2 while another may be a reference to the beloved Knights of the Old Republic video games. We get our first look, sort of, at the first Jedi while at the temple with Luke and Rey. Did you think Rian Johnson forgot about the famous line “I have a bad feeling about this?” Think again! We got to see the old X Wing used in a very interesting way and get a call back to a character from Rogue One in the form of a ship. Of course, being Star Wars, there are a ton of cameos in the film that you likely didn’t catch either, some of them being quite obvious! So strap in for the video and enjoy the ride!

It has been reported that hundreds of people are being auctioned in modern day slave markets in Libya for as little as $400.

Libya is the main transit hub for refugees and migrants attempting to reach southern Europe by sea. They are coming from countries like Nigeria, Eritrea, Guinea, Ivory Coast,, Gambia, Senegal, Sudan and Somalia.

The power vacuum in Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi has made human trafficking and people smuggling a booming trade.

And the European Union's renewed strategy to stop migrants and refugees travelling across the Mediterranean has led to more people being stuck in the north African country without money or food.

It featured some engaging stories, introduced audiences to new planets with unbelievable visuals, and gave fans moments they have been waiting for for over forty years.

But there was also plenty of The Last Jedi that some fans weren't happy with. And while not all of those criticisms were valid, there were some issues with merit. 

And I believe there is one small change that can be made to Star Wars: The Last Jedi that addresses almost all of those issues and it centers around one character: Rose Tico.

Its popularity was first helped along by the (ultimately false) belief that he was dissing Texas rapper Tay-K. The song’s beat is handled by Izak, an up-and-coming producer who recently linked up with Genius to break down how the viral track came together.

The film with a two and half hour runtime is follows further the storylines of returning characters Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker, General Leia, Finn, Poe Dameron, Genera Hux and Supreme Leader Snoke. Rian Johnson and the production team made some bold decisions and unexpected changes to the mythology in ‘The Last Jedi’. Some fans have been voicing their displeasure loudly online and it may be the reason for the huge discrepancy between the Critics Score and the Audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Kristian Harloff, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff and John Rocha are here to discuss the issues behind the discrepancies and offer their opinions on some of the bold decisions Rian Johnson made with the film.

We were at a DVC event at Animal Kingdom until really late at night so we decided it was a good idea just to get a room for the night. We found a standard room at Disney's All Star Movies Resort for only $99 for the night! We used mobile check in so we didn't have to visit the front desk at all and just went right to our room when it was ready. This saved so much time and made the whole process so easy! Once we were in the room we noticed a few details about it that made sense as to why this was the cheapest Disney room available. Tim's biggest complaint was that there was no coffee maker in the room! The pillows were also very very thin and made sleeping very difficult. All in all this was the cheapest room we could get at Disney and you get what you pay for. Join us tomorrow for an all new video!

✍️ Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How long have you been smiling?
It seems like it's been too long
Some days I don't feel like trying
So what the fuck are you on?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling in love like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Verse 2]
But I can't really keep lying
'Cause I've been scared all along
Getting sick of sleeping in
While all my friends are popping pills
And I don't think that they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling apart like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Outro]
I won't deny it 'cause you dont' give me the words
I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck
So I'll start it out
You know I am so in love

They break down what worked in the film, what they felt might not have worked in the movie and if it was a great culmination of the ten years of MCU films. These are very knowledgeable comic book lovers so you know they are going to provide some unique insight into the movie.

Marvel’s ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ arrives in theaters this weekend. The film is directed by The Russo Brothers and stars Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Tom Holland and Josh Brolin. This has been the culmination of ten years of MCU films and world building from Marvel, Disney and Kevin Feige. In the film, the Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.

The architect of the opposition's upset win is the veteran politician who made the ruling alliance a formidable force during his 22 years as Prime Minister. 

Mahathir Mohamad returned to active politics two years ago in an unusual role for him.

As an opposition leader, he accused Prime Minister Najib Razak of stealing millions of dollars in government funds. 

And he's channeled the anger of millions of Malaysians about the rising cost of living and corruption into his latest electoral success - two months before his 93rd birthday.

Okay, okay, maybe we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves. But for those who are wishing for Dove will play the iconic teenage witch in CW’s “Riverdale” spinoff, maybe don’t get your hopes up too high because it doesn’t look like that’s happening any time soon. 
In an Instagram video, Dove teased her fans with information about an upcoming project and no, she made no mentions of Sabrina BUT a very familiar face popped up and whisked her away before she could give us any more details. 
UNFORTUNATELY we don’t know any more than what she told us. However, being the natural detectives that we are, we can only assume that by her Instagram caption – and all the Twitter love she’s been receiving from her new cast members -- Dove will be appearing in the upcoming season of ABC’s TV show “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”
Naturally, there were some VERY excited Dove fans who are totally here for her being in the Marvel Universe. One fan wrote QUOTE, “What other people wanted: Dove on Riverdale/Sabrina. What we got and deserved: Dove in the Marvel Universe.” Another fan ecstatically tweeted their disbelief, saying “I can’t believe Dove Cameron is joining the Marvel fandom. This is amazing news omg.” 
Meanwhile, others… like Selena’s stans were just glad Dove didn’t make an announcement about being Sabrina the Teenage Witch. One of Selena’s fans wrote in all caps “DOVE AS SABRINA IS CANCELLED SINCE SHE’S GOING TO STAR IN ANOTHER UPCOMING ABC FAMILY SERIES. THAT MEANS SELENA ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE NOW, YES.” 
Well, we don’t know if Dove is COMPLETELY out of the running as Sabrina the Teenage Witch since not much has been said about Dove’s involvement on Agent’s of SHIELD. So, let’s not take her out of the race completely. Who knows, maybe Dove can do both!
What are your thoughts on this? Are you upset that Dove is possibly out of the running as Sabrina? Let me know in the comment section below. When you’re done with that, click right over here to get all the deets on the rumors of Selena Gomez possibly returning to TV as Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

Description:
Being a sports announcer is one of the coolest jobs out there. You’re paid six to 7 figures to call the biggest sporting events on national television. And heck, you can make an epic sports moment even more great if you can call it properly.

Unfortunately, some of the best sports moments of all-time were ruined by terrible commentary. I’m DeQwan Young, and today we present 10 times where the announcer ruined a great game.

And a big shoutout to JasonPorchVideos for suggesting this idea to us!

In particular, I focus on the relationship between chaos and order-how Bruce Wayne needs to combat chaos to bring order into his life.

4 DIY HAND WARMERS

REUSABLE DISPOSABLE HANDWARMERS
SUPPLIES
Disposable hand warmers
Plastic bag

INSTRUCTIONS
Save those one time use hand warmers. Once it has lost its heat place it into a plastic bag.
Push out all the air and keep the bag closed for a few hours.
Open the bag and takeout the hand warmer. By shaking it it will reheat and get hot again. Throw out once it isn’t reheating.

RICE BAG WARMERS
SUPPLIES
Fabric
Adhesive fabric tape
Uncooked rice
Microwave
Scissors
Essential oil, optional

INSTRUCTIONS
Cut 2 pieces of fabric into desired size and shape.
Line the edges with fabric tape. Lay the other piece of fabric on top leaving one side still open.
Carefully pour in rice and 1-2 drops of essential oil (optional) into the pouch.
Carefully peel off the tape and stick the edge so rice does not still out.
Microwave the pouch for 30 second to a minute depending on the size of the heat pack.
Enjoy a nice scented heat pack to carry with you anywhere.

ICE MELT INSTANT PACKS
SUPPLIES
1/2 cup ice melts (calcium chloride)
1-2 tablespoons water
2 Medium size plastic bags
1 small bag

INSTRUCTIONS
In a medium bag pour ice melts. Set aside
In a small bag pour in water and close the bag.
Place the water bag into the bag filled with ice melts. And shut the bag so nothing spill out.
Take it with you wherever. When ready to use just pop the water bag within the other bag so the ice melt and water mix.
The reaction of calcium chloride and water will instantly give off heat for 30 minutes.

HOT ICE HEAT PACKS
SUPPLIES
100 grams sodium acetate trihydrate
25 milligrams water
pot
Vinyl bag for best use, but plastic bags will work.
Food coloring, optional
Flat iron
Slap bracelet (or measuring tape)
Scissors
Hole puncher

INSTRUCTIONS
In a medium pot mix sodium acetate and water.
Slowly heat up the mixture until the crystals dissolve.
Simmer for 2 minutes until you are left with 25% of the liquid from what you started. You should see a layer of crystals forming. If the crystals starts to harden then add a few drops of water. DO NOT let it crystallize into a solid block or start over. This did take me at least 4 times to get the right solution. Be patient, thank you.
Pour the clear concentrated solution into a container and let it cool overnight.
Remember those slap bracelets hiding in your closet, well strip the outer layer and take out the metal piece. My slap bracelet was a measuring tape!!! 
Cut the metal into a small circle. Using a hole puncher carefully punch a half circle. You don’t want to punch all the way through. You just want a slit so it creates a clicking sound. This will become your activator.
Place the activator into the pouch. Then carefully pour the solution ⅔ of the way into the bag.
Seal the edge with a flat iron, making sure there is no leaks.
Click the activator (you may have to click it a couple times) and watch the hot ice form.
This pouch will give off heat for 30 minutes, but is forever reusable! Just drop the pouch into a pot of hot water until there is no crystals left in the bag. Keep it a room temp until you need to reactivate the heat pack.

Lyrics
I can’t help it
The way I feel you in my bones
Don’t mind the judgement
You lock me up when we’re alone

They don’t really know our business
They don’t really need to know what we do
They don’t really need to know where we go
When it’s just me and you
Gotcha touchin on me all in secrete
Want you lovin on me all four seasons
Baby tell me who I think we’re pleasin’
I wanna be with you

Baby they don’t get us
Never had this love before
I wish they knew just how I felt
Bet they’d be ready to adore you
How could they call this bad love
When all I want is more
When all I want is more

It’s getting heavy
Oh I can see it on your face
Ohhh
If you let me
Then I will love you all over the place

They don’t really need know our business
They don’t really need to know what we do
They don’t really need to know where we go
When it’s just me and you
Gotcha touchin on me all in secrete
Want you lovin on me all four seasons
Baby tell me who I think we’re pleasin’
I wanna be with you

Baby they don’t get us
Never had this love before
I wish they knew just how I felt
Bet they’d be ready to adore you
How could they call this bad love
When all I want is more
When all I want is more

Baby it’s no secret
We can’t hide it anymore
I wish they knew just how I felt
Oh don’t they know I adore you
How could they call this bad love
When all I want is more
When all I want is more

Baby they don’t get us
Never had this love before
I wish they knew just how I felt
Oh I know that they’d adore you
How could they call this bad love

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Solution to the bonus riddle mentioned at the end: https://brilliant.org/TedEdTitanic/

Your interstellar police squad has tracked a group of criminals to a cluster of seven planets. Now you must apprehend them before their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the fugitives won’t just stay put – they’ll try to dodge you by moving from planet to planet. Can you devise a sequence for searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them in ten warps or less? Edwin F. Meyer shows how.

Lesson by Edwin F. Meyer, animation by TED-Ed.

It sometimes feels like musicians can get away with anything. For instance, Ozzy Osbourne can bite the head off a bat and still land a reality show. So what would a musician have to do to get in some real trouble?  Depending on the artist in question, maybe not so much. So if you happen to be struggling with a hyper-successful music career and don't feel like doing it anymore, take note. Any one of these moments could have you on food stamps faster than you can say ""goodbye, career…""

I’m breathing just to pass the time • I forgot to eat
tonight • just running down the clock today • with hope
the ache will go away

body starts to shake • head begins to spin
leaves me in its wake • i’m paralyzed with pain

we suffer in a heartmachine • unstable • feeling everything
pins and needles stitching up my skin • we suffer trapped in
a heartmachine

Hope is strange,  Sometimes it leads you on • there’s no exception
when you’re halfway gone • a second chance flash of light that
brought me to my knees • a burning vision etched in memories

body starts to shake • head begins to spin
leaves me in its wake • i’m paralyzed with pain

we suffer in a heartmachine • unstable • feeling everything
pins and needles stitching up my skin • we suffer trapped in
a heartmachine

time heals the wounds • it builds up strength inside
facing the truth, there’s nothing left to hide

we suffer • unstable • pins and needles
we suffer trapped in a heartmachine

The original idea for this Bob Marley Song Around The World was born back in 2013 when the PFC crew first visited the Congo.  Mark asked himself, “How can we live in a world that allows people to live like this, with virtually no food, no money, and no hope?” The lyric, “Things are not the way they used to be...one and all got to face reality” came to mind as he looked out into the river of garbage running through the city. “Natural Mystic always felt so deep in its groove and lyrics and it seemed as important and urgent as what I was seeing all around me,"" says Mark.

 We need to rise up and make the planet a better place right now for ourselves, our children, and all living things. “Just a Little Bit” written and performed by Paula Fuga was added as a medley to “Natural Mystic” to take the music from minor key to the major key—from the darkness to the light.

Alpha works out daily and says that working out is the most important thing about going to the gym. BUT you can look good while you're doing it. In this video men's style, grooming, fitness and lifestyle expert, Aaron Marino of IAmAlphaM, AaronMarino, and Pete & Pedro is presenting how to look good while hitting the gym.
Looking Good When Working Out

1 . Wear clothes that make you feel confident and sexy so you feel good about yourself
2. Don't worry about matching brands
3. Match in terms of color
4. Invest in higher quality athletic wear for durability and better fit
5. Not all workout clothing is created equal
6. Shoes should be stylish and clean as well as functional
7. Variety! Don't wear the same exact thing everyday like Alpha's 'red shirt guy'
8. Don't look like you're trying too hard, like the super coordinated guy at Alpha's gym. In other words, look good, but not too good.
9. Bring a towel!
10. Know when it's time to retire workout clothes (example: holes, stinky)

Alpha is so impressed with Public Rec! He even used his own discount link to get himself some more workout pants! Public Rec's All Day Every Day pant is tailored, making Alpha look taller (not dumpy). The pants are so cool because they come in waist size and inseam length.The pocket also feature zippers.  The pants are literally perfect - they look great in the gym and for running around.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/didnNmWFpvs/sddefault.jpg,0.021117127030372752,0.0019781676315756567,10.675094816687738,0.002145724181911395,0.023095294661948408,0.0252410188438598,2018-01-20,14:58:31,Saturday,5,13,29,12,20,63,183,3,31,3,0,9,0,4,5,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.436070479513779,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prince Harry has finally found his dream girl, American actress Meghan Markle, and he sealed that deal by proposing and announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017. As the world waits for the happy couple to walk down the aisle, we decided to take a look back at some of the girl’s Harry has dated. These women all grabbed his attention and wowed him at some point throughout the years, and you’ll be amazed to see how they’re all a lot different from Markle. From Natalie Pinkham to Chelsy Davy, Lauren Pope, and Natalie Imbruglia, here are 14 girls Prince Harry has dated.

Harry has dated a series of beautiful women, including Catherine Ommanney who he met in 2007. She was a lot older than him, but that didn’t stop him from planting a smooch right on her lips during a night out on the town. Two years later, he was linked to Caroline Flack and Astrid Harbord. These ladies turned out to be just flings, but Harry was inching closer to his happily ever after. 

In 2010, the Prince was spotted out with Camilla Romestrand before moving on to Florence Brudenell-Bruce, and Mollie King. But it wasn’t until 2012 when he met Cressida Bonas that people thought he was finally ready to settle down. You’ll have to watch our video to see what went wrong and why these two fizzled out.

If you’d like to hear more about the other women he has dated, including Camilla Thurlow and singer Ellie Goulding, make sure to watch our video. Let us know in the comments section which of these past relationships shocked you the most!

F. Gray Gray will be directing the film with ‘Iron Man’ writers Matt Holloway and Art Marcum hired to write the screenplay. Sources are saying that it will be more of an ensemble piece and less of the two-man job that the first Men in Black trilogy was with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. So, what can we expect from an MiB reboot that stars two actors closer in age than the original duo? Also, since the rumor is that the film will be more global in scope what countries or cities might we possibly see in the movie?

John Rocha and Dorian Parks sit down to answer these questions and give you their initial thoughts on this news. They explore what they’d like to see from this reboot and how much of the original vibe of the first trilogy will be the template for this film.

But at Eggslut, chef Alvin Cailan is turning the everyday breakfast sandwich into a work of art. A cult favorite in L.A., and now available at Chefs Club Counter in NYC, Eggslut’s secret is patience. Eggs and butter are added to a cold pan, and gently stirred on low heat. The result is something soft, smooth, and covered in melted cheese and sriracha mayo. Eggslut’s Fairfax is a must-try for any egg-sandwich enthusiast.

There are a total of six Palico Gadgets that you can get in the base game of Monster Hunter World. Each gadget allows your Palico to do different things in battle and some of them are extremely helpful. This gadget will show you where to find all palico gadgets.

[0:00] Vigorwasp Spray - This is the default gadget for your Palico and is obtained automatically.

[0:09] Flashfly Cage - This is obtained from the first zone, Ancient Forest. To obtain it you need to find the Bugtrappers. They get be found way up the top of the ancient forest, as shown in the video. Follow the one who runs away from you to receive the gadget.

[3:13] Shieldspire - This is obtained from the second zone, Wildspire Wastes. To get the gadget you need to find the Protectors, who are found in a small hole in the floor at the back of the map.Talk to them and then complete their quest to catch the other protectors who got  lost to get the Shieldspire gadget. The lost protectors are marked on the map.

[6:43] Coral Orchestra - This is obtained from the thurd zone, Coral Highlands. Find the Troupers in this zone and then defeat the Shamos they are riding on. You will now get an objective to follow the scoutflies to the home of the Troupers. Once you arrive, you'll get a quest to hunt two Tzitzi-Ya-Ku. Complete this quest and you'll receive the Coral Orchestra gadget after the rewards screen.

[10:01] Plunderblade - This one is the trickiest to get, as it requires you to do a few things and then wait an undetermined amount of time for the plunderers to spawn. First, look at zone 13 on your map and set a waypoint to the researcher. Talk to him and he'll mention the Ocodragon carrying prey back to the cave he is in. Now, you need to wait for an Ocodragon to bring a Legiana to this cave. Once that happens, a Plunderer will spawn by it. Follow the scoutflies and then when it runs up the wall, you need to place some raw meat on the floor to get it to come out. Once it comes down and brings it's friends, talk to them to receive the plunderblade.

[13:20] Meowlotov Cocktail - This is the final gadget and you can only get it after you have the other ones and you have unlocked the Elder's Recess zone. Talk to the Lyrian Researcher in Astera and he'll give you a critical bounty to find 10 Gajalaka tracks / doodles. You can only find the Gajalaka in the HIGH RANK zones, they will not spawn in the low rank ones. Open your map and switch it to small monsters so you can find them on the maps easier. Go to them and they'll usually be 1 or 2 tracks / doodles around them. Once you have 10, go back to  the researcher and talk to him. He'll give you a new bounty to go to the Elder's Recess at night. Go there and find the researcher on the map. You need to sneak past the Gajalaka in the camp reach the leader at the end to recieve the Meowlotov Cocktail gadget. Use the ghillie suit to make the sneaking very easy.

Major League Soccer is marking Earth Day 2018 with a variety of initiatives and celebrations, including MLS WORKS’ third annual Greener Goals Week of Service, but the most prominent one will be worn on the pitch this weekend.

MLS has collaborated with adidas and Parley to support Parley for the Oceans. During Week 8 matches, MLS players will wear special adidas kits, built of technical yarns made using Parley Ocean Plastic™. The gear will be supported by all 23 clubs and comes in two colorways, non-dye and carbon, differentiating the two teams in each game.

Selena made her big return to the American Music Awards last night after a tumultuous year where she  performed her latest hit, “Wolves.” The production was very impressive, there was a whole scene onstage that made it look like we were in the woods and Selena had just been hit by a car, there was blood on her face, and the dancers were legit wolves. It was great. But then following the performance, the camera zoomed in on Selena’s face and she didn’t exactly look happy. 
Fans have a few theories as to what could have happened to make Selena appear so sad. First of all, many people believe she was lip synching throughout the performance. 
So if she was, maybe she didn’t feel that she executed it well? Others think it was because Justin Bieber wasn’t in attendance or the fact that he liked and then unliked one of her instagram photos where she debuted her blonde hair. In response to the liking and unliking, one fan tweeted – “their whole relationship in a nutshell.” According to a source, Justin attended a concert with Jaden Smith last night instead of attending the AMAs, but before you pass judgments, take into account that Justin and Selena probably had a conversation about whether or not they should make their couple debut on the same night as her big performance and he probably didn’t want their relationship to overshadow how big of a night it was for Selena. Another theory about why Selena looked sad is the rumor going around that she had a panic atrack righ  before the show. A fan tweeted QUOTE – “There was a rumor that Selena had a panic attack during her performance, we don't know how true this is but could be why she looked sad throughout .but no matter what we are grateful for everything she has done and #WeAreProudOfSelena” Another said – “The fact that Selena had a panic attack before going on stage and then actually performing is both heartbreaking but shows just how strong she really is @selenagomez I love you so much baby.” 
However regardless of the face she made following her performance, Selena seemed in great spirits on Twitter writing QUOTE - ""Thank you guys! We did it! Thank you to my best friend Petra [Collins] for helping me bring it to life,"" she said. She added the caption, ""grateful grateful grateful.""
So who knows what caused the face. Maybe she was just emotional or still in character. Others are saying that it may have had something to do with her finally unfollowing The Weeknd which he followed suit with shortly after, but whatever happened, I just hope she’s ok. At the end of the day, it was great to see her return. 
What do YOU guys think caused Selena to make that face? Sound off in the comment section below and don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey and I’ll see you next time.

When you see the new movie musical The Greatest Showman in theaters over the holidays, you’ll probably be amazed by the singing voice coming out of Rebecca Ferguson‘s mouth.

Well, that’s not actually Rebecca singing. Her voice was dubbed with singer Loren Allred‘s for her role as Jenny Lind.

Loren is best known for making it to the Top 20 on season three of The Voice. She was on Adam Levine‘s team and went home way too early!

I recommend this for beginners to ITC: https://amzn.to/2sEhzuR

The Angry Grandpa of Youtube fame passed away. By request of his family (Michael Green), I attempted to reach him using my Wonder Box. Did I? 

Not sure, but only Michael Green can really answer that by listening to these messages. While only a few messages came in, to me, they were VERY interesting indeed. 

I have heard from over 100 fans of the Angry Grandpa asking me to do this and telling me Michael Green was trying to reach out to me to do a session for Charles. Well, here it is. I attempted and did my best.

Please know I do this work, and have for 7 1/2 years now, with full respect for those who have passed on. Our souls go on forever, and we never truly die.

Stand up to the cult’s leader, Joseph Seed and the Heralds, and spark the fires of resistance that will liberate the besieged community.

In this expansive world, your limits and creativity will be tested against the biggest and most ruthless baddest enemy Far Cry has ever seen. It’ll be wild and it’ll get weird, but as long as you keep your wits about you, the residents of Hope County can rest assured knowing you’re their beacon of hope.

She dispatches her case quickly and efficiently, crushing the girls and their small-town lawyer – her former high school classmate Billy Crawford (Peter Mooney, Rookie Blue, Camelot).

After winning her case, she discovers the girls are sicker than anyone thought. Otherwise healthy young women have been overcome with uncontrollable twitches and seizures, making life unlivable. They need help. Joanna also realizes she may have unresolved personal business in town. Even though she’s a successful partner in a big law firm, she can’t ignore the feeling that something in her life is not right. She becomes convinced all the answers she’s seeking about her broken life can be found in her old hometown. And if she’s going to fix herself, she has to start where it all began – with uncovering all of her family’s deepest secrets.

Here is my quick 7 minutes burrito recipe :

Ingredients :
Chicken (already cooked, it's quicker), mushrooms, red & green pepper, onion, garlic, brocoli, feta cheese, french gruyère cheese (or any grated cheese), sesame seeds and oil, cayenne pepper, mixed herbs, pine, taco boats or warp, or lettuce (if you want to have it like miss Janni).

Recipe :
In a hot pan (that already has a tiny bit of any oil), drop your chicken, onion, peppers mushroom, broccoli, garlic and condiments.
When you have the good color, add a bit of sesame oil and the pine nuts.
Crush the feta in the bottom of your taco boat or lettuce. Add the magic mix from the pan. Add some gruyère on top.
Well done, you just finished the fastest best meal ever !

1) ‘Black Panther’ on Track for a Possible $120 Million Debut

2) Charlie Kaufman to Write and Direct ‘I’m Thinking of Ending Things’ for Netflix

3) First look at Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel revealed

4) Casey Affleck Withdraws From Oscars: Won’t Present Best Actress Award

5) Hans Zimmer Returning to Superhero Movies to Score ‘X-Men: Dark Phoenix’

6) Jumanji 3 to Potentially Take on Star Wars: Episode IX in 2019

7) Live Twitter Questions

Early tracking numbers are in and they estimate that Ryan Coogler‘s Black Panther will enjoy a Presidents’ Day Weekend opening box office between $100 million and $120 million, placing the debut movie for Chadwick Boseman’s T'Challa between Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok’s opening weekend.  

Charlie Kaufman is making the jump to Netflix. The writer of films like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation., and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and director of Syncedoche, New York will write and direct a film adaptation of the Iain Reid novel I’m Thinking of Ending Things; this according to a report from Variety. 

AGREE/DISAGREE

An unofficial set photo (and first look) has landed online for Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel. The movie is directed by Half-Nelson directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, telling what will be the MCU’s first prequel story. The movie takes place in the 1990s and will reveal Larson character’s origins, with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as Nick Fury. 

Deadline reports that Casey Affleck has withdrawn from presenting the Best Actress Award at this year’s Academy Awards. According to the trade, Affleck notified the Academy of his decision, claiming he did not want to become a distraction from the focus that should be on the performances of the actresses.

Composer Hans Zimmer has been out of the superhero movie game for a few years now, but it appears he’s ready to come out of “retirement” by agreeing to score X-Men Dark Phoenix.  Collider had originally heard rumblings that Zimmer might be scoring the 20th Century Fox superhero film, with co-star Evan Peters recently confirming the news while appearing on Josh Horowitz’s podcast HappySadConfused.

In a new interview with The Wall Street Journal, Sony motion pictures chief Tom Rothman has confirmed talk of a third Jumanji movie, with the head of the studio hoping it will be ready for Christmas 2019. This would put the movie head to head again with a Star Wars movie, as JJ Abrams Episode 9 has already secured a December 20, 2019 release date.

About Alto's Odysse:
Just beyond the horizon sits a majestic desert, vast and unexplored. 

Join Alto and his friends and set off on an endless sandboarding journey to discover its secrets.

Soar above windswept dunes, traverse thrilling canyons, and explore long-hidden temples in a fantastical place far from home.

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

From AAA's Press Kit:
""According to new research from AAA, premium gasoline offers some benefit to select vehicles, but is becoming increasingly expensive for drivers. In recent years, the price gap between premium and regular-grade gasoline has risen from a historically steady 10 percent to 25 percent or more per gallon. While past AAA research has shown no benefit in using premium gasoline in a vehicle designed to operate on regular fuel, new testing indicates that some vehicles – those that recommend, but do not require premium gasoline – may see increased fuel economy and performance under certain driving conditions when using the higher-octane gasoline. Unfortunately, the high cost of premium gasoline may outweigh that advantage for many drivers. As a result, AAA recommends drivers weigh the potential benefits against the cost of using premium gasoline, if their vehicle does not require it.

“AAA’s testing reveals that drivers could see modest gains in fuel economy and performance when opting for premium gasoline in vehicles that recommend, but do not require, the higher-octane fuel,” said Megan McKernan, manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California’s Automotive Research Center. “Those seeking the maximum capabilities of their performance-focused or utility vehicle may see some benefit from using premium gasoline, particularly over the long haul.”

In partnership with the Automobile Club of Southern California’s Automotive Research Center, AAA tested a variety of vehicles that recommend, but do not require, the use of premium (91 octane or higher) gasoline. Although drivers of these vehicles are unlikely to see any benefit from using premium gasoline during typical city or highway driving, a combination of laboratory and on-road tests were performed to simulate extreme driving scenarios such as towing, hauling cargo and aggressive acceleration. When using premium fuel in these vehicles under these conditions, AAA tests found that:

- Fuel economy for test vehicles averaged a 2.7 percent improvement. Individual vehicle test result averages ranged from a decrease of 1 percent (2016 Audi A3) to an improvement of 7.1 percent (2016 Cadillac Escalade).

- Horsepower for test vehicles averaged an increase of 1.4 percent. Individual vehicle test result averages ranged from a decrease of 0.3 percent (2016 Jeep Renegade) to an improvement of 3.2 percent (2017 Ford Mustang).

- According to national averages, the price difference between regular and premium gasoline is approximately 20 to 25 percent, or 50 cents per gallon.

- The modest fuel economy improvements found in AAA tests do not offset the higher cost of premium gasoline.""

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s engagement is almost over: the couple is due to marry this month at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

There’s a tight guest list for the May 19 ceremony -- just 600 people were invited to the service, Kensington Palace announced in March.

Markle, however, won’t have a maid of honor.

“She has a very close-knit circle of friends and she didn’t want to choose one over another,” Kensington Palace told E!. “All have been actively involved in helping her prepare for the day and will be there in the days beforehand. She’s very happy to have their support.”

Kensington Palace revealed May 16 the bridesmaids will be Princess Charlotte, 3, the daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and Harry's godchildren, Florence van Cutsem, 3, and Zalie Warren, 2.

Meghan’s goddaughters Remi Litt, 6, and Rylan Litt, 7, will join her close friend's daughter, Ivy Mulroney, 4, as part of the bridal party.

The page boys will be William and Kate's son Prince George, 4, and the children of Meghan’s best friend and unofficial wedding planner Jessica Mulroney -- twins Brian and John Mulroney, who are 7.

Ammar has struggled with discipline and focus for his whole life, so a few months ago he decided to sign-up to a marathon to force himself to train and run everyday. But as the weeks went by, his mental health deteriorated and he failed to train. He almost gave up on the marathon but 3 days before it was happening... Something incredible happened, he changed his mind and decided to chase the impossible.. Run a marathon without having trained.

Better than Nike Kyrie 4 or Nike Lebron 15? Top 10 Under Armour Curry 5 is coming next year! The best shoes of the best NBA point guard?

Hello and welcome back to another one of my videos. Since Under Armour have released the Curry 5, I am not sure if they are making more of the Curry 4 so I have decided to make a top 10 list of the best colorways of the basketball shoe. This list will consist of custom basketball shoes as well as player exclusives. I have rated these shoes only on their appearance and not performance on court since they are all the same. There are shoes Stephen Curry wore in the 2017 NBA Finals, NBA All Star Game Of 2018, and 2017 NBA Championship Parade. There are even shoes that Microsoft Xbox X made as a collaboration with Under Armour and shoes that celebrate Steph's friendship with Barack Obama, the last president of America. Is this NBA Signature basketball shoe better than that of Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Kobe Bryant or Paul George? You tell me. I will be making a top 10 Under Armour curry 4 low Of 2018 soon so look forwards to that video too. If you have any request for a top 10 video, then please do feel free to put it in the comments below. But please make sure to put in the keywords, ""top 10"", in it. Now enjoy!

Species Profile : Dilophosaurus | Jurassic World Evolution

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

The conversation is moderated by Ronald Collins, a constitutional law and First Amendment expert and the Harold S. Shefelman Scholar at the University of Washington School of Law.

Rosenstein was sworn in as the 37th Deputy Attorney General of the United States on April 26, 2017, and has served in the Department of Justice for nearly three decades under several presidents and attorneys general.

Following is the text of the video.

First, get your supplies. Measure the paper to see how much you need. Pull the loose end over the top of the box until it covers the top and sides and touches the table. Leave a little extra slack and cut the paper off the roll.

Now for the sides. The paper should go a little over halfway up the side. Make it even on both sides. Cut off the excess paper. Pull the longer sides up over the box and tape them.

Push the paper from the top into the corner with your thumb. Crease the paper diagonally. Repeat on the other side.

Push the bottom of the newly formed triangle in close to the box. Crease the diagonal along the table. Repeat on the other side.

For a cleaner edge, make a small fold first. Then fold up that final flap and tape it. Once again, repeat on the other side.

Then, the fun part... unwrapping!

e1icO-oq-5A,8C8pRDetZr8,Report: Hawaii Wasn't Ready for Threat Alert,AP Archive,25.0,2018-02-26 02:38:26+00:00,"['AP Archive', '4140849', 'cad97b43432ac01a8cc7e37e4b3c7a94', 'US Missile Threat', 'David Ige', 'Honolulu', 'Hawaii', 'United States', 'Government and politics']",709.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1icO-oq-5A/default.jpg,"(21 Feb 2018) Hawaii's nuclear missile scare showed that the state began testing alerts before fully developing a plan to address the ballistic missile threat and that a public outreach campaign months earlier wasn't effective, said a report released Tuesday.
The state Department of Defense, the agency that oversees Hawaii's emergency management, released the internal review after an alert was sent to cellphones, televisions and radio stations across the state last month.
The notification, which read ""BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL,"" triggered widespread panic as more than a million residents and visitors feared they were about to face a ballistic missile strike.
Governor David Ige assigned Brig. Gen. Kenneth Hara, the second in command at the Department of Defence, to conduct a comprehensive review of the agency's operations.
The public didn't get adequate directions about what to do, the report said.
An agency employee mistakenly sent the alert to cellphones and broadcast stations across the state during a shift-change drill at the agency on January 13.
Officials later disclosed the employee didn't think he and his colleagues were participating in a drill and instead believed a real attack was imminent.
The state has since fired him.
State officials said the worker, who had been employed at the agency for 11 years, had mistakenly believed two prior drills — for tsunami and fire warnings — were actual events.
His supervisors counselled him but kept him for a decade in a position that had to be renewed each year.
The ex-worker disputed that, saying he wasn't aware of any performance problems.
The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety after receiving death threats, told reporters that he was devastated about causing panic but was ""100 percent sure"" at the time that the attack was real.
It took the agency 38 minutes to send a follow-up message cellphones notifying people the alert was a mistake, in part because the agency had no prepared message it could send out in the event of a false alarm.
Agency officials notified broadcast stations earlier.
Within hours of the alert, the agency changed protocols to start requiring that two people send an alert.
It also made it easier to cancel alerts by preparing a pre-programmed false alarm message.
The report's recommendations include suspending all activities related to the Ballistic Missile Preparedness Campaign, with the exception of the monthly ballistic missile alert tone siren testing, until a plan is published and the majority of Hawaii's public know ""what to do, where to go, and when to do it.""
