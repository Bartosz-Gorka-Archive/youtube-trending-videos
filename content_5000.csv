The Falklands, best known for a long history of land disputes, consist of more than 700 islands and islets. The archipelago wears the scars of war openly. The last conflict, when Argentina invaded the islands it claims as the Malvinas in 1982, ended after a brief but intense engagement with the United Kingdom. Roughly 20,000 land mines have not been accounted for, burned-out helicopters mar the landscape, and the Royal Air Force still has an active airfield on East Falkland.

Today the resiliency of nature is everywhere. The Falklands archipelago is a haven for more than a hundred bird species, many of them seabirds. Thirty-six percent of the global numbers of southern rockhopper penguins, for example, live here. But the extraordinary profusion of wildlife still faces man-made risks: pollution, degraded habitat, oil slicks, baited hooks dragged behind fishing vessels, and, notably, climate change.

SF9 4th Mini Album [MAMMA MIA!]
MAMMA MIA MUSIC VIDEO

MAMMA MIA! 진짜 사랑을 찾았다!
SF9 미니 4집 ‘MAMMA MIA!’ 2월 26일 발매

SF9이 네 번째 미니앨범 ‘MAMMA MIA!’를 통해 하이틴 뮤지컬 영화 속 주인공으로 돌아온다.

새 앨범의 타이틀곡은 신나는 레트로 댄스곡 ‘맘마미아(MAMMA MIA)’로, 밝고 사랑스러운 에너지로 무장한 SF9의 유쾌한 매력을 담았다. ‘맘마미아’를 비롯해 다채로운 장르의 여섯 곡이 수록된다.

SF9(영빈 인성 재윤 다원 로운 주호 태양 휘영 찬희)은 자동차를 형상화한 군무로 화제를 모은 ‘부르릉’, 미래소년 ‘쉽다’, 태양의 기사 ‘오솔레미오’ 등 매 활동마다 다채로운 콘셉트로 사랑 받고 있는 9인조 남성 댄스그룹이다. ‘맘마미아’는 섹시한 라틴팝에 도전했던 지난 ‘오솔레미오’에서 180도 변화될 예정이어서 팬들의 기대가 고조되고 있다.

MAMMA MIA! Finds True Love!
SF9 to Release their 4th Mini Album ‘MAMMA MIA!’ on February 26th 

SF9 come back as main characters of a teenage musical movie through their 4th mini album, ‘MAMMA MIA!’

The title track of the new album is a retro, upbeat dance song called ‘MAMMA MIA’ which shows the bright and cheerful energy of SF9. Along with ‘MAMMA MIA’, the album consists of six tracks of various genres.

SF9(Young Bin, In Seong, Jae Yoon, Da Won, Ro Woon, Zu Ho, Tae Yang, Hwi Young, Cha Ni) is a 9 member dance boy group who drew attention with their various concepts for each album such as the synchronized dance from ‘Roar’, futuristic boys from ‘Easy Love’, and knights of the sun from ‘O Sole Mio’. Fans are looking forward to the change that ‘MAMMA MIA’ will bring compared to the previous sexy Latin pop track, 'O Sole Mio’.

Welcome to our home Wakanda,
I am your king the black panther,
Do I ever freeze no never,
Could I ever leave no never,
Wakanda's my home and I love her,

Challenge for the throne I fight ya,
Might like to know I night ya,
But not like a king with a sword when they knight ya,
I'll send you to sleep in submission you beat, that's good night bruh,

You ain't taking my crown, this my throne,
This tradition, this family, this home,
These my people they loved now you know,
The love here is strong and it grows,

I fell in love with Nakia,
She makes me freeze when I see her,
This king has a weakness it's clear,
This king has a weakness it's clear,

Welcome to our home Wakanda,




Gone off the rails, found out father kills,
His own pure blood, now I gotta deal with his bills,
Kill monger, feels hunger, longs for revenge on,
His dead father, puts guilt on black panther, nah,

This isn't my burden to bear, but for Wakanda,
""Come take me on cus, ill school ya!""
""A fight to the death no mercy is left boo ya!""
Am I dead or in debt to man-ape,

Found in a watery grave I escape,
Give me the herb and I'll save,
Shuri you never cease to amaze,
Gimme my neckless it's time to play,

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.

Then, Camille Cosby penned a three page letter calling her husband's conviction ""mob justice"".

Plus, Miley Cyrus got slammed for posing naked in a sheet at 15 and had to apologize to the world. Ten years later she’s taking that apology back.

이번 OST 앨범에는 드라마의 주요 장면마다 삽입되며 시청자들의 관심을 불러모은 Sondia의 ‘어른’을 비롯, ‘착하다’를 돌려듣던 6회 지안의 계단 씬에 삽입되었던 ‘정승환’의 ‘보통의 하루’ 등 총 10곡의 가창곡 전곡을 포함, 드라마 구석구석을 가득 채우며 작품의 높은 완성도에 기여한 연주곡 23곡을 더해 총 33곡이 두 장의 CD에 삽입되며 풍성한 구성을 선보인다.

특히, 이번 OST 음반은 패키지가 ‘서류봉투’형태로 구성이 되며 내부에는 감성적인 포토북과 포스터로도 활용 가능한 가사지에 특전 싸인 폴라로이드(3매)까지 더한 알찬 구성으로, 종영의 여운이 깊이 남을 시청자들에게 큰 선물이 될 것으로 보인다.

Can I learn to Ollie, Kickflip, Drop-in & Grind in just 30 days! I'll be sharing my journey along the way.

I have had it edited for a really long time but just kept forgetting to upload (I know, I suck) so I've actually been living here now for almost 4 months. I am trying to be better about actually uploading (I have a ton of videos that I have filmed and some which are even edited but I just have not remembered to sit down and upload them). Hopefully, I can remember and be a little better.

Una BACHATA con su inconfundible sello. Ha sido compuesto en letra y música por María Artés & Maki y producida por J. Orleans.

QUISIERA PARAR EL TIEMPO es su noveno disco, la segunda parte de la trilogía INCONDICIONAL, que sigue la estela de los grandes éxitos logrados en la anterior entrega como fueron Cuéntame, Ay Mare o Loca entre otras.

Para este nuevo proyecto, Maki sigue produciendo junto a Gustavo Olmedo e incorpora nuevas voces como Pilar Bogado y Santi López, uniéndose a las ya conocidas Helena, Saray Jiménez y los grandes triunfadores en solitario María Artés y Demarco Flamenco.

Trece años después de su debut, Maki ha pasado de ser ese joven andaluz que revolucionó el Rap Flamenco Fusión a reconvertirse en un artista versátil, un productor artístico diferente y un descubridor de talentos de la talla de Demarco Flamenco o María Artés.

Más de 600 conciertos en directo en trece giras consecutivas, miles de discos vendidos, más de 200 millones de visitas en youtube y una legión de seguidores en redes sociales que generación tras generación han cantado sus hits y sus feats, hacen de Maki el prototipo de artista luchador e incansable que vuelve a la palestra con una gira 2018 que recorrerá los puntos más importantes del país con grandes sorpresas escénicas.

Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración 
Cuanto tu me miras se me sube el corazón 
(Me palpita lento el corazón) 
Y en silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras 
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol 

(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando) 
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío 
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando) 
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando) 
Ese fuego por dentro me está enloqueciendo 
Me va saturando 

Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía 
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía 
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) 
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) 
Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía 
Con tu filosofía mi cabeza está vacía 
Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) 
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) 


  

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo 
Bailar contigo, tener contigo 
Una noche loca (una noche loca) 
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca) 
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo 
Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca 
Con tremenda loca 
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh) 

Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión 
(Estoy en otra dimensión) 
Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón 
(Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón) 
Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte 
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor 

(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando) 
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío 
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando) 
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando) 
Ese fuego por dentro me está enloqueciendo 
Me va saturando

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”.

Ready Player One (RP1 Movie) SYNOPSIS┊
From filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon. The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse. But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world. When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger. Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline. The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. “Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” upcoming “Dunkirk”). Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”). The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”). Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, and Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.” Slated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5q_-C0dbZkY/sddefault.jpg,0.009013192451451322,0.00012179989799258545,74.0,0.0002283748087360977,0.009134992349443908,0.009363367158180005,2017-12-14,06:57:53,Thursday,3,10,66,10,34,68,535,1,73,0,0,9,0,0,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.541406433199141,18,"['happy', 'angry', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'neutral', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'neutral']",1,0,0,15,0,0,2,"{'book': 1, 'person': 15}",16

About Annihilation
A biologist's husband disappears. She puts her name forward for an expedition into an environmental disaster zone, but does not quite find what she's expecting. The expedition team is made up of the biologist, an anthropologist, a psychologist, and a surveyor.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The two epic franchises we just can’t get enough of are closer than we thought. Both “Star Wars” and the MCU have been using some of the same actors. Often looking so different, we don’t even realize they were in both sets of films! Marvel’s massive collection of films stars some of the greatest actors in the world. So who out of the iconic characters in “Thor,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Iron Man,” and “Guardians of the Galaxy” also appeared in “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” or “The Last Jedi” or even “The Phantom Menace”? 

“Black Panther” saw a lot of success this year, with Lupita Nyong’O, the Hollywood it girl starring alongside Chadwick Boseman. Of course Andy Serkis has had his motion capture hands all over both these franchises. Felicity Jones, Oscar Isaac, Benicio Del Toro, and Natalie Portman have all dabbled in both the franchises...do you know which roles they played? Can you pick them out even with the heavy makeup on or the beautiful costumes? As for Paul Bettany having the Mind Stone ripped from his skull by Thanos, will we still like him as the villain Dryden Vos? Ray Park brought Darth Maul to life...do you know the Marvel mutant he also portrayed? Rose Byrne and Donald Glover have some sneaky crossover roles as well, we’re almost certain you didn’t notice one of Byrne’s first American roles. As for Glover, AKA Childish Gambino, he’s taken off to a whole other level! 

Watch this video to see the actors you didn’t realize were in both “Star Wars” and Marvel movies! Bet you can’t guess every single one of them!

This led to more than one person speculating online that an Obi Wan Kenobi standalone movie might be in the works. McGregor helped fuel the speculation when he said that he’d “…be happy to play him again” according to LA Times reporter Yvonne Villareal.

Jedi Council’s Kristian Harloff and Ken Napzok are here to break down their thoughts on McGregor’s look last night and if there could be an Obi Wan standalone film on the horizon. They also explore what the plot might be and what beloved characters or locations we might see pop up in the movie. They also speculate on the image that was released on Twitter of McGregor in training for a film. Let us know what you think this all means and if you agree with Kristian or Ken.

Most people who I show this to are surprised to learn it isn't stone. I think there are a lot of possibilities left for this material. If you give it a shot, let me know. I've love to hear how it turns out for you!

I show you how to tell if a battery is charged or not just by how high it bounces! First, I weigh some batteries before and after discharging them in order to see if the weight changes. Then I talk about what changes inside of a battery and what makes it bounce like it does! I was careful to discharge them slowly so I didn't have a battery explosion like in a hydraulic press!

[verse 1: jeremy zucker]
we know that this won't last
not like it used to
and i'm okay with that
but not if i lose you

[pre-chorus 1: jeremy zucker]
i can feel it in my bones
sinking deeper in the overflow
can you feel it in your soul?

[chorus: jeremy zucker]
if i'm honest, maybe we're better off alone
(better off, better off alone)
maybe we're better off alone
(better off, better off alone)
maybe we're better off
maybe we're better off alone
maybe we're better off

[verse 2: chelsea cutler]
i won't turn my back
now that you want to
and if there's nothing left
why does it haunt you?

[pre-chorus 2: chelsea cutler]
i can feel it take control
falling further in the undertow
can you feel it in your soul?

[chorus: chelsea cutler & jeremy zucker]
if i'm honest, maybe we're better off alone
(better off, better off alone)
maybe we're better off alone
(better off, better off alone)
maybe we're better off
maybe we're better off alone
maybe we're better off

[outro: jeremy zucker & chelsea cutler]
i can feel it in my bones
running circles
'cause you're all i know
and i feel it in my soul
if i'm honest...

From Van Gaal, the coach for whom Iniesta made his debut in the first team, to the likes of Buffon, Henry and Lineker, everyone wants to wish Iniesta well as his time at FC Barcelona comes to an end.

To honour a unique player, the Club asked a multitude of personalities from the worlds of football and sport to define what the man from Fuentealbilla means to them. The #Infinit8Iniesta campaign and this video, issued during the institutional act of farewell to the player, is the result of the admiration towards Barça’s infinite No.8.

We put together a second list of 15 times when Gordon Ramsay actually liked the food Part 2! Like we’ve seen in our three previous videos, it does happen all the time. It’s just pretty rare. That's why we continued to search high and low so we could show more of those happier times in Gordon’s life.

Most chefs are incapable of satisfying Gordon Ramsay’s sophisticated needs, but every now and then a chef manages to blow Ramsay away. It doesn’t happen often, but we’ve found the rare instances where Gordon Ramsay actually enjoyed the food. Just like we’ve seen in our past videos, Gordon Ramsay has had a few moments where he actually liked the food that other people have prepared for him. We all know that Gordon Ramsay seems to have a soft spot for kids. We’ve done some additional research and found 15 more Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD from other people on the show MasterChef Junior.

As you have seen in our other videos. Gordon Ramsay liking food is not a hoax. This actually happened. So, hold onto your forks & knives, because you are about to be blown away for the 4th time!

Lyrics

I spoke a vow today and asked if god would come and play
I’ve dug a shallow hole for him to sleep
But I swear he just won’t answer me
I call on out is he afraid, I’ll bury him down with the ones he keeps
And if the devil’s listening, I’ll come for him as well
If I suspect he had a hand to play
And if I see his face in town, there’s room for two down underground
Nothing’s gonna stop me ‘til I’m done
Until I’m done
Because tonight I’m killing gods
It’s guilt and frustration, it’s everything between
The silence and the absence hitting home
Peripheral glances and the chasing of a sound
I never knew I’d miss until it’s gone
So ask me how I’m coping
And I’ll smile and tell you “I’m just fine”
While down inside I’m drowning in the fucking rain
Because when everything is empty
And your heart is set to cave
Sometimes all you wish for is a place
Is a place to place the blame
Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Damn you all
Because tonight I’m killing gods
The incendiary shock wave, scorched earth policy
The devastation that only loss will leave
The chants and incantations of daily rituals
A subtle lapse in brutal honesty
So ask me how I’m coping
And I’ll smile and tell you “I’m just fine”
While down inside I’m screaming ‘tiI I fucking bleed
Because when everyone’s expendable
And your heart can’t take the wait
The last thing that you wish for is the face
Is the face to face the pain
Burn your heaven
Flood your hell 
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Damn you all
Because tonight I’m killing gods
I spoke a vow today and asked if god would come and play
Because I just want to cut that fucker down
Face me 
None survive
The devil and god have died inside me

Description:
Looks can be deceiving, they say. Never judge a book by it’s cover, they also say.

Well, not with sports logos. If it looks awful, then it is awful. I’m not buying that jersey or hat if I have to look ridiculous.

The sad thing is, some sports teams used to have a great logo. Then they changed the logo. And their logo went from great to reaaaaal bad. I’m Justin Fraction, and today we present the 10 worst logo changes in sports.

And a big shoutout to DAHminator209 for suggesting this video!

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

""COUNCIL OF WOLVES AND SNAKES"" LYRICS:

Nomads plunging into the vast abyss
Unattached, fleeting through the chasm
Naked in pure darkness
Embracing the new dawn

We are gods here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are gods 
Yield to the dragon's embrace

As pawns in this secret game
No one knows nothing
Yet, in the realm of sacred play
Everyone knows everything

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee

We are gods in the making
We are here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are of transcendence
We are wolves and snakes

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee
The arrival is in the departure
We are sculpted into life
By the hands of death",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ws18_MZ-lw/sddefault.jpg,0.013111403124543728,0.0010772558037669734,12.171113934773402,0.0015800664330559205,0.014188658928310702,0.015768725361366618,2018-03-30,11:00:01,Friday,4,11,62,11,61,66,575,3,118,5,0,5,8,2,2,5.0,8.0,"['Ser eT ;', 'Vv tod ve']","['Ser', 'eT', ';', 'Vv', 'tod', 've']",True,"['ser', 'eT', ';', 'Vv', 'tod', 've']",6,6,13,1,0,1,1,5.077867141106925,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'dog': 1},1

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically, I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Bey-Hive I started with 4lbs of my Ultimate Vanilla cake dyed bee-right yellow, and 6lbs of Ultimate Chocolate Cake dyed black. All of these layers were showered with HONEY Simple Syrup before being covered in fondant, and adorable fondant bees adorn the outside- with the Queen on top of course!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

매운닭갈비 vs 매운짬뽕 vs 매운닭발... 보니까 한국에서는 외국인은 매운 음식을 잘 못 먹는다는 편견이 있는 것 같더라고요. 오늘은 매운 음식을 사랑하는 저희 친구들 두 명과 함께 (심지어 둘 중 한 명은 인도 혈통으로 타고났음!) 그 편견이 사실인지 시험해보려고 합니다!! ... 아 아니 이게 아니지... 한국에서 꼭 먹어봐야 할 매운 음식을 찾으러 나섭니다!^^ 재밌게 봐주셨음 좋겠네요!!

In Korea I've found that there is a stereotype that foreigners can't eat spicy food. Well today we have two of our friends who love spicy food (one of whom has it in his Indian blood!) so we set out to find out if that stereotype is true or not!! ... I mean... we set out to try and find the MUST TRY Korean SPICY FOOD dish^^ Enjoy!!

Lyrics:

Running from the morning
Think I hit a wall
Late night, not you
Running from the moment
So I don’t recall
Late nights, not you

Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I’d do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

I tried spending my nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

Drowning in my coffee
To wash the alcohol
Out my bloodstream
Sitting here I wonder
If we hadn’t been at all
Who would I be

Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-GFF1GMt1A/sddefault.jpg,0.02204019369882931,0.00017320075795194078,127.25229357798165,0.00043379639376953967,0.022213394456781246,0.022647190850550787,2018-03-02,05:00:03,Friday,4,9,21,9,20,54,127,5,28,1,0,7,0,2,6,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.502599638145988,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

In this episode of the strangely popular ‘This is Why’ series we look at the biggest VR game of the year, Fallout 4 VR. Honestly from release until now Fallout 4 VR has had so many problems it really has been an absolute nightmare.

This Fallout video only lists the bulk of the problems Bethesda let slide though the VR release, there are unfortunately a few more but these are the major ones. If you know of anymore bugs that you thought were an absolute nightmare let me know and I will try to put them into Fallout 4 VR Is An Absolute Nightmare – This Is Why – Part 2!

AND If you enjoy my ‘This Is Why’ series please do let me know what you like and what I should do more of, I will eventually move away from Fallout 4 and modding (but I will not stray too far!)
I have a feeling modding Fallout 4 VR will not fix a lot of the problems this time round, and although Fallout 4 VR is an absolute nightmare, beyond the problems listed here it is still a genuinely really fun game, Bethesda have achieved a lot bringing Fallout 4 to the VR world.  

I have now moved into camera work as well as commentary for this Fallout 4 themed video, I really hope you enjoyed the jump. Soon I will jump back into modding and machinima but I have a few more fun videos of this type to get though first.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-JD18kS0GQ/sddefault.jpg,0.0209925049087002,0.0008307496300835789,25.26935209900509,0.0010968475460530825,0.021823254538783768,0.022920102084836854,2018-01-11,21:57:11,Thursday,3,11,39,10,35,51,262,0,52,1,1,8,8,5,6,4.0,6.0,"['Te ie v7"")', '. a 7 a 4 ie', 'Penh:']","['Te', 'ie', 'v7"")', '.', 'a', '7', 'a', '4', 'ie', 'Penh:']",True,"['Te', 'ie', 'v7', ""''"", ')', '.', 'a', '7', 'a', '4', 'ie', 'penh', ':']",13,11,21,3,0,1,2,6.617581094685633,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'stop sign': 1},1

Sam Smith performing 'Too Good at Goodbyes' live on the BRITs 2018.

Lyrics:
You must think that I’m stupid
You must think that I’m a fool
You must think that I’m new to this
But I have seen this all before

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

I know you’re thinking I’m heartless
I know you’re thinking I’m cold
I’m just protecting my innocence
I’m just protecting my soul

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you
mean the most to me
‘Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

No...
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you’ll see me cry)
Oh...
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)

‘Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes

You know how all the popular eateries of today boast of fresh ingredients, unique toppings and clean places? That's exactly how White Castle became famous. Yes, that same place where Harold and Kumar went to chow down on a ton of sliders was at one time the pinnacle of innovation, and responsible for changing the entire way Americans eat. And they owe it all to a tiny hamburger. Here's what you don't know about White Castle's famous sliders…

On September 28, 2016, Walt Disney Pictures confirmed that Jon Favreau would be directing a fast-tracked remake of the 1994 animated film The Lion King, which would feature the songs from the 1994 film, following a string of recent box office successes on the other Disney remake films such as Maleficent, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast with the latter three also earning critical praise. Later on October 13, it was reported that Disney had hired Jeff Nathanson to write the screenplay for the remake. In November, talking with ComingSoon.net, Favreau said the virtual reality technology he used in The Jungle Book would be used to a greater degree in The Lion King.

In mid-February 2017, Donald Glover was cast as Simba, with James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa from the 1994 film.
In April, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were cast to play Timon and Pumbaa respectively. In July, John Oliver was cast as Zazu. In August, Alfre Woodard and John Kani were announced to play Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.

Earlier in March, it was announced that Beyoncé was Favreau's top choice for the role of Nala and that the director and studio would be willing to do whatever it took to accommodate her busy schedule. Later on November 1, her role was confirmed in an official announcement, which also confirmed that Chiwetel Ejiofor would play the role of Scar, with Eric Andre, Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, J.D. McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph joining the cast as Azizi, Shenzi and Kamari, young Simba and young Nala, respectively.

Performing as a band for over a decade, Double Faced Eels have made it their goal to expand beyond the limited music industry in their home of Latvia and make a name for themselves in the U.S. The fun-loving group always takes a positive spin and comically got their name when they accidentally aggravated a club owner who then called guitarist Martins “Mark” Gailitis a “two-faced eel.” The band also consists of Reinis Straume, Ronalds Briezkalns and Victors Maslovs.

The members of Two Less Lonely, Nikki Rechtszaid and Jimmy Levy, are both from Florida and met at a social media influencer event where they realized their music, already popular on social media, was brought to another level when they collaborated. Their first YouTube cover has received over a million views. Diagnosed with juvenile arthritis herself, Nikki has also leveraged their following to raise awareness and support for the Arthritis National Research Foundation.

Wondering what to do with that roll of cookie dough in the back of your freezer but you're ALSO craving a cupcake? I gotchu!

**PS This is another video that I filmed and edited myself. I'm trying to do that more as it's fun and I get to do it whenever I like/can and Sam is incredibly busy so it works around that. A few of you last week mistook this different format for me being sad/tired/on drugs (!) which I found a little bit ridiculous. I love that you guys care about me enough to be concerned, and watch my videos enough that you can tell there is a difference in the style of my DIY videos but that's all it is. Hopefully I'll get better at it and you can all just enjoy the recipes, which is my primary purpose for everything :)
**

Recipe -
For the cookies ...

350g plain flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 large free range egg
2 tsp vanilla extract
230g unsalted butter
100g caster sugar
220g light soft brown sugar
150g chocolate chips

For the Cupcakes...
100g burnt butter (start off with 125g, then measure again, as you'll lose some as the water evaporates)
30g soft butter
125g self raising flour
65g caster sugar
60g soft brown sugar
1/4 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)
50g finely chopped choc chips
2 large eggs
1.5 tbsp milk

To decorate use vanilla buttercream, or even swiss meringue buttercream!

Star Wars: The Last Jedi somehow managed to keep pre-release details shrouded in secrecy - and that caused fans to dream up their own unusual theories and speculations before even buying a ticket. Considering that at two and a half hours, The Last Jedi is the longest franchise entry to-date, there's a lot to look forward to that no amount of teasers could possibly spoil. But some of the behind-the-scenes details surrounding the movie were guarded a little less under carefully. From Easter egg reveals to production conflicts as well as even one or two plot-related scoops that came through a little earlier than expected, here's what you might not know about Episode 8…

About Mayim Bialik:
You ​might know me as Amy Farrah Fowler from The Big Bang Theory or from Blossom​ but there are so many other parts of me that you might not be aware of​!​​ I’m trained ​as a​ neuroscientist, ​I'm ​a passionate activist, an observant Jew, a​ perfectly imperfect​ mother, and ​I'm a complicated human being​ like many of you​. This is the place where I wear ​all of those hats - and none of them have a flower on them! ;)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62VnAuhqtUQ/sddefault.jpg,0.026738388284969904,0.0007636330967568054,35.01470588235294,0.003189291168807834,0.02750202138172671,0.030691312550534543,2018-05-03,14:18:04,Thursday,3,8,40,8,26,39,285,4,55,0,0,7,0,1,2,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.796524052991197,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

FULL LYRICS: 

Tell Me I Can’t
 

[VERSE 1]

Lacing up my gloves

Cause I ain’t afraid to fight

Stepping in the ring

It’s going down tonight

 

They’re calling out your name

Wanna see me bleed

Firing words like weapons

But they won’t hit me

 

[PRE-CHORUS]

You’ve got nerve to be the judge of me

But I don’t buy your fake reality

 

[CHORUS]

Tell me I can’t

I’ve heard it all before

Tell me I can’t

Nothing motivates me more

Tell me I can’t

And you’re gonna see me win

You’re gonna see me win

 

[VERSE 2]

Think I’m just a girl

Who doesn’t know my place

But you don’t see the sweat runnin’ down my face

 

Hearin' what you say but I don't take it in

You know the greatest battle

is the one within

 

[PRE-CHORUS]

You’ve got nerve to be the judge of me

But I don’t buy your fake reality

 

[CHORUS]

Tell me I can’t

‘Cause I’ve heard it all before

Tell me I can’t

Nothing motivates me more

Tell me I can’t

And you’re gonna see me win

 

[BRIDGE]

I’ve got faith

I’ve got love

I’ve got dreams I’m never givin’ up

 

Won’t turn back

Won’t go home

Won't ever listen when they told me no…   
 

[CHORUS]

Tell me I can’t

I’ve heard it all before

Tell me I can’t

Nothing motivates me more

Tell me I can’t

If you come to Chengdu, make sure to visit this Chinese street food market, found here:

Farmers Market Name: Supo Farmers Market, 苏坡农贸市场

I first found deep fried duck, cooked in a pressure deep frier! Then, right beside that street stall, there was Chinese fried intestines with tons of Sichuan chilies! We also ate some amazing and spicy Sichuan style wraps,  some Sichuan spiced soybean starch jelly, and walked through the vegetable and meats area, perfect for picking up the ingredients needed to cook a ton of different Chinese recipes.

After visiting the market, we went to a famous Dan Dan noodle joint in a little alleyway of Chengdu, and tasted a bowl of Sichuan Dan Dan noodles and of course some spicy chili oil wontons! They were so amazingly delicious and fragrant! 

Address: 郭家桥西街5号

Why are most planes painted white?

When a brand-new plane rolls out of the factory, they are very often painted in a greenish anti-corrosive paint, so that the plane can fly or be moved to the final assembly line and paint shop. Therefore they are nicknamed the ""green jets"" and are a rare sight for plane spotters.
But once the plane arrives at the paint shop, let´s take an Airbus A380 as an example, it takes approximately 34 painters, working in three shifts each day for fifteen days to wash, prepare and paint the plane. After 6000 working hours, they´ve roughly applied 1100 kilograms (2425 lbs) of paint onto the plane. And that procedure needs to be repeated every seven to eight years, depending on the use of the plane and cleaning schedule.

After applying a minimum of two layers, the plane gains a few more pounds to its dry operating weight, and even more, if a third more colourful layer is sprayed onto it such as the company logo etc.
Therefore putting fancy detailed liveries onto planes is not only costly at first, but also increases it´s operating cost.
For example, a Boeing 737 paint job can be as heavy as 500 kilograms which equals 6 passengers who aren´t paying for their flight and increasing the fuel consumption.

See more about it in the video :)

I love my fire ants, black crazy ants, and Polyrhachis ants, but none of these ant colonies have ever had an ant farm setup quite as epic as that of our yellow crazy ants, we call the Golden Empire. In this episode we completely renovate and upgrade our Golden Empire' overrun terrarium and transform it into a mind-blowing, open concept paludarium (half terrarium-half aquarium) which functionally offers a more suitable habitat for our Golden Empire yellow crazy ant colony.

Hey guys, I got a lot of valuable feedback from you guys for my recent video on face massage and many of you asked me which oils should we use while doing the face massages. So today I am here to share with you some oils that you can find in your kitchen cabinet and can be easily used for face massage. Like I told you in my last video, all you need is 2 to 3 minutes for this daily routine and you will see some miraculous results. So try these oils that I am telling you and feel smoother, younger and prettier!

Castor Oil
I have been using castor oil since I was pretty young and it has been a home remedy for me for a host of problems. Castor oil happens to be one of the most widely used oils, owing to the fact that it has plenty of benefits for your skin. I often use it to cleanse my skin and moisturise it. But there are multiple benefits of castor oil. It
is great for blemishes, pigmentation, sunburns, redness, under eye puffiness, inflamed skin, acne etc.
Well, the best think I like about this oil is that it has anti ageing properties. So an anti ageing massage along with this anti ageing oil is your perfect beauty hack before a good night’s sleep.

Almond Oil
Sagging skin. Baggy eyes. Dullness. These words are an absolute turn off for us girls. And then why be sulky over all this, especially when you have the elixir of youth handy- almond oil. Trust me, massaging your under eyes with this oil just before you hit the sack is a sure shot remedy for getting rid of dark circles. Also regular application of almond oil on your skin will make you feel younger and fresher within no time. The vitamin E and fatty acids present in this oil reverse and prevent signs of aging. It not only helps in skin renewal but also fights wrinkles. It also removes impurities and dead skin cells, reduces tan and promotes those flirty eyelashes
that you sooo love! So don’t take refuge in concealers and rather find this oil in your kitchen to work on those dark circles and skin problems!

Coconut Oil
It’s no surprise that I’m a huge coconut oil fan, because its got multiple benefits for skin and no side effects. You will be surprised to learn just how great coconut oil is for the skin. In fact, you can ditch those extra expensive skin products and go natural with coconut oil. All you have to do is dab it a bit on your lips see how it gets you those soft pink lips. When you use it to massage on your skin, it will not only soften your skin, but also act as an anti ageing cream and moisturiser. Let me share a personal tip with you. Coconut oil is a great make up remover too. So without worrying about any harsh chemicals just use this oil to remove that heavy makeup you have been wearing all day and let your skin breathe!

Olive Oil.
Probably, olive oil is a staple in your kitchen whether you use it for cooking or whipping up easy salad dressings! But it has some great skin benefits. So if you have extra olive oil on your hands from cooking, don’t be so quick to rinse it off. Olive oil has amazing moisture-holding properties, and it can hold water against the skin to keep it smooth and hydrated. So you can use it for a hydration boost. If you have a dry, itchy or inflamed skin, use olive oil as a cream to relieve the discomfort. It really works wonders for those who have a dry skin. Olive oil is also rich in vitamin E and so it is a great oil that helps with anti ageing. It also helps in gathering and neutralising free radicals that can otherwise damage the skin and fasten skin ageing. So use it like a mask and see how it works its magic in just a few days!

Hope this video was helpful and you guys had a great time! Do use these oils for at least a month consistently to see the results. Club it with the face massage and let me know your feedback! I love to get your feedback as it helps me get more videos that are helpful. So keep sending me feedback and connect with me on facebook, insta and my blog.

Catch you up soon with my next video! Have a great time!

Love and health
Uma

Here's the lyrics -


+WOO OH I CAN SEE YOU IN MY MIND
I’LL FIND YOU WITH MY INNER EYE
BLIND-FOLD ON YOU CANNOT HIDE
WOO OH HAVE I CURSED THIS LITTLE TOWN
SENT INSIDE THE UPSIDE DOWN
BUT ALL I WANT IS TO BE FOUND

FOR ME IT’S SO HARD TO BE, NORMAL MY HOMES A LABORATORY 
MUMA’S ELECTRICAL LOBOTOMY LEFT ME
HOPELESSLY LONELY SO PAPA LOOKS AFTER ME
FAMILY TREE TORN INTO PIECES
SO PAPA CAN HARNESS THE FORCE OF MY TELEKINESIS 
TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF INTER-DIMENSIONAL TRAVEL
THAT INCREASE MY NOSE BLEEDS AND FORCE ME TO SEE THINGS
THAT CAUSE ME TO SCREAM WHEN I’M LUCIDLY DREAMING
I CAN’T SEEM TO SHAKE THIS UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING
THAT WITH ME INSIDE IS A DEMON THAT’S BREATHING
WHO OPENS A PORTAL TO TRAVEL BETWEEN
TO CONSUME ALL THE SOULS TILL IT’S FINISHED IT’S FEEDING
I KNOW IF I STAY I’LL BE NEXT SO I’M LEAVING
I SMASH THROUGH THESE DOORS TILL I’M OUT IN THE FREEZING
SOME FOOD AND SOME SHELTER IS ALL THAT I’M NEEDING

WOO OH I CAN SEE YOU IN MY MIND
I’LL FIND YOU WITH MY INNER EYE
BLIND-FOLD ON YOU CANNOT HIDE
WOO OH HAVE I CURSED THIS LITTLE TOWN
SENT INSIDE THE UPSIDE DOWN
BUT ALL I WANT IS TO BE FOUND



NOW I’VE GOT A GROUP OF FRIENDS
WHO TREAT ME HOW I LIKE
GIVE ME SHELTER IN THE NIGHT
I THINK I’VE GOT A CRUSH ON MIKE..
I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WILL ON THE OTHER SIDE
I’LL HELP YOU FIND HIM IF YOU’D LIKE
JUST FEED ME EGOS AND I’M FINE

AND NOW I GOT STRENGTH IN ME,
LONELY BEFORE BUT THIS FRIENDSHIP IS EVERYTHING
BONDED WITH CHEMISTRY SEPARATELY WEAK
BUT TOGETHER WE FIGHT AND DEFEAT ALL OUR ENEMIES
GUYS FIGHT WITH STRATEGY MENTALLY
I USE THE GIFT OF TELEPATHY USE IT AS WEAPONRY
THREATEN THE GROUP AND I’LL THROW YOU AROUND WITH MY MIND
TILL YOU RUN AWAY BULLIES ARE EASY PREY
THO-EVEN WITH POWERS MY WEAKNESS IS EVIDENT
KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN THE LAB SO I’M DELICATE
PETULANT TURN ON MY FRIENDS ANGER EVIDENT
NEVER GO BACK TO RESUME THE EXPERIMENT 
WITHOUT ME I KNOW THEY CAN NEVER SUCCEED,
BUT WITH COURAGE I CARRY THE WILL TO PROCEED
SUBMERGED IN A TANK I CAN SAVE WILL BELIEVE ME
ILL MUSTER MY STRENGTH AND RELEASE HIM TO FREEDOM


WOO OH I CAN SEE YOU IN MY MIND
I’LL FIND YOU WITH MY INNER EYE
BLIND-FOLD ON YOU CANNOT HIDE
WOO OH HAVE I CURSED THIS LITTLE TOWN
SENT INSIDE THE UPSIDE DOWN
BUT ALL I WANT IS TO BE FOUND




NOW I’M STANDING FACE TO FACE 
WITH A BEAST FROM THE OTHER SIDE
EVEN THOUGH I’M TERRIFIED I PUT MY HAND INTO THE SKY
BLOOD STREAMING DOWN MY FACE I KNOW THIS COULD END MY LIFE,
BUT FOR FRIENDSHIP AND FOR LOVE I WILL GLADLY SACRIFICE

NOW BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE STILL ALIVE
LONELY AND PETRIFIED FIND AN ESCAPE BUT I’M TERRIFIED
IF I GET CAUGHT I’LL BE BACK INSIDE HAVE TO ADAPT
OR I WON’T SURVIVE SQUIRREL FOR DINNER TONIGHT
THAT I ROAST ON AN OPEN FIRE EGOS IN TUBS SO THAT I CAN FIND,
HOPPER MY SHINING KNIGHT GIVES ME A HOME IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
CARES FOR ME DAY AND NIGHT I SHOULD BE SATISFIED
BUT I FEE JEOPARDISED MENTALLY PARALYSED
NEVER A VISITOR, CANNOT STEP ONE FOOT OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER
INSULAR PUNISHMENT HE WILL ADMINISTER 
FINDING THE BOXES THAT LEAD ME TO MAMA
I RUN FAR AWAY BUT SHE’S LOCKED IN A COMA
SO NEXT I GO VISIT MY SISTER BUT RUN COS SHE’S SINISTER
KILLING ALL THOSE WHO WOULD DARE TO IMPRISONED HER

WOO OH BACK TO HAWKINS IT IS TIME
TO USE THE POWERS IN MY MIND
TO KILL THE VINES THAT INTERTWINE 
WOO OH CLOSE THE PORTAL SAVE THE TOWN
NO MORE THREAT FROM UPSIDE DOWN
NOW I CAN FINALLY SETTLE DOWN…

DA DA DA DA DA DA DA ADA A DADADDADADA
NO MORE THREAT FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN, I CAN FINALLY SETTLE DOWN…
NO MORE THREAT FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN, I CAN FINALLY SETTLE DOWN…

This was a fairly novel material to the arms industry, and they were able to exploit it fantastically in the AR-10 and AR-15 rifles. The AR15 rights were sold to Colt in 1959, though, and Armalite went in search of other guns to market.
 
One of these was the AR-17, introduced in 1964 to the commercial market, aimed at hunters and sport shooters. It was a short recoil action with a 10(!) lug coating bolt similar to the earlier Armalite rifles and a 2-round capacity, chambered for 2.75” 12 gauge shells. It didn’t have a magazine so much as a single round lifter/elevator in addition to the chambered round. Most importantly, it was a nearly all-aluminum gun, weighing just 5.5 pounds (2.5kg). Only the barrel extension and bolt were steel, plus a few small parts. The receiver and barrel were hardened aluminum, and the furniture was foam-filled Nylon. The was truly the shotgun from The World of Tomorrow!
 
Unfortunately for Armalite, being extremely lightweight was not necessarily a good thing in a shotgun. It was certainly nice to carry for long periods while hunting, but short shooters found its heavy recoil to be punishing. The light weight also brought complaints that it did not swing well. And finally the limited 2-round capacity, while not logically a problem for the intended uses, was a turn-off to many potential buyers. Parts for 2000 of the guns were manufactured in 1964 and 1965, but only about 1200 were actually assembled and sold. The gun was a commercial failure by all measures.

Tyga‘s not giving up on his hopes that he’s really the daddy of ex Kylie Jenner‘s newborn daughter. Even though she’s already given her baby Stormi Webster the actual last name of BF Travis Scott, 25, that’s still not enough proof for him. Now Tyga wants to see a picture of Stormi’s face to check out if she resembles him. “Tyga has heard through the grapevine that Stormi looks a lot like his little son King when he was a newborn. Tyga wants to see for himself. He’s trying to get a picture so he can get eyes on Kylie’s little girl and be the judge,” a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

Kanye West + Kid Cudi: Pioneering Modern Music

Throughout music history, iconic songwriting duos have produced some of the greatest albums of all time. Among some of the best in music, the collaboration between Kid Cudi and Kanye West is considered the most influential of the last decade.

Kanye and Cudi first crossed paths at a record store in New York City. Cudi had just moved to New York in 2004 in order to pursue his ambitions to become a musician. With nothing more than a demo and $500 to his name, he was determined to make it in the music industry. 

The Day n Night demo eventually caught Kanye’s attention, and in 2008 he signed Cudi to his label, GOOD Music, giving him the tools he needed to release his debut mixtape, A Kid Named Cudi.

When Kanye West began work on his 4th studio album, he felt that rapping alone didn’t fully express the emotions he was feeling. In order to convey the melodies in his head, he heavily autotuned his voice, produced instrumentals inspired by 1980’s synthpop, and prominently featured the Roland TR-808 drum machine. 

Kanye knew the direction he wanted to go with the album, but he couldn’t fully create the atmosphere he desired without the help of Kid Cudi. Cudi heavily contributed to the sound of 808’s & Heartbreak. He helped write and produce numerous tracks and was even featured on Welcome to Heartbreak, and Paranoid. 

Upon its release, 808’s received mixed reviews from critics. A review from SPIN stated, “808’s leaves us with unresolved melodies, self-pity, and the nagging realization that there really is no escape from T-Pain.”

This was harsh criticism, but the impact that 808’s and Heartbreak had on the music world wasn’t fully realized until years later. Without the influence of 808’s, we wouldn’t have artists of today such as Drake, Post Malone, and Lil Uzi Vert.

A year after the release of 808’s, Kid Cudi released his debut album, Man On The Moon: The End Of Day, which featured an atmospheric, and psychedelic sound. It was one of the most unique hip-hop albums to come out of that time period. Kanye West was the executive producer on the album and co-wrote the tracks: Sky Might Fall, and Make Her Say.

Since those early projects, Kanye and Cudi have continued to work together on numerous tracks, and the tracks that they’ve collaborated on have been some of the biggest hits to come from either artist. 

The two artists have decided to officially release a full-length album under the name, Kids See Ghost, which is expected to be released on June 8th, 2018. With the kind of music the two have produced together in the past, this is something to get excited about. Projects like 808’s and Heartbreak, and Man On The Moon, pioneered new sounds and inspired a whole new generation of hip-hop. Will Kids See Ghost do the same?

The first happened on Monday, sending lava as high as 700 meters and ash 3 kilometers up in the air. The second eruption happened on Tuesday, producing an ash column at least 5 kilometers high. Mount Mayon, located about 330km southeast of the capital Manila, is considered to be the most volatile of the Philippines' 22 active volcanoes.

The Philippines is part of the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" islands that were formed by volcanic activity. Mount Mayon has erupted over 50 times in the past 500 years and the most deadly eruption was in 1814, when the ashes buried a small town, killing more than 1,000 people.

The story of Axel Johansson started when he shared his instrumental track 'River' as a tryout on YouTube. The instrumental electro track started unexpectedly to gain attention from YouTubes big gaming community, firstly with features at small music channels which evolved to features in gaming videos. One of those tapping into the song was the gaming channel RedMogly, who has used the track for two of his videos which totally has been seen more than 1 million times. This resulted in great interest from the viewers asking about the track and more music. Axel then got together with a vocalist with whom he made a topline for the track, which was officially released through disco:wax Nov 17th.

LYRICS
You can kill the lights
you can draw the blinds
my heart’s shackled down
bound to your bed
Can you stay a while?
keep me by your side
feel my scattered heart
fix me I said
 
We could lay here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
 
We could sleep here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
we could go home
 
We could go home
down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
down below, low, low
 
Can we stay inside?
lay here by the fire
please dont let me go
say it ain’t so
Leave me in the night
with no warning sign
are we burning out?
mirrors and smoke?
 
We could lay here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
 
We could sleep here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
we could go home
 
We could go home
down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
down below, low, low
 
We could lay here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
 
We could sleep here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
we could go home
 
We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low
 
We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low

At the height of their power, infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard and Henry Morgan commanded as many as ten ships and several hundred men. But their stories pale next to the most successful pirate of all time, who commanded 1,800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Dian Murray details the life of the fearsome Madame Zheng.

But while Deadpool's antics on the big screen have been hilarious, not everything in the comics has been quite so funny. Here's a look at some things Marvel wants you to forget about Deadpool...

He's a murderous psychopath | 0:19
He's in love with death | 0:56
He's served himself as a cannibalistic snack | 1:32
He's basically a complete ripoff | 2:04
His mental health issues are played for laughs | 2:45

I'm PSYCHED for MONHUN! I threw this together real quick in celebration of the 3rd beta and full release later this month! This short focuses on just the Ancient Forest, but maybe after release I'll do more! 

And if you like this, maybe I could do more for other games, or anything! It's animated very simply so it can be done quick (since typically I go months without updating..) I had fun making it, so I hope you enjoy! Lemme know what you think, and what other games, or movies or whatever you'd like me to make Something About!

Subscribe for more! And if you like it, please consider sharing and supporting my Patreon! If just 1% of my subscribers gave me $1 a month I'd be able to do this for a living and focus on Youtube full time! https://www.patreon.com/sidequests

“‘Jackie Chan’ came together pretty spontaneously. Dzeko and I have been friends with Post for some time. When we met Preme in Las Vegas, he showed us the vocal he and Post had been working on and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to collaborate. I’m really excited to put this out for you all to hear. We’ve definitely created a summer anthem with this one.”

LYRICS:
She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

Drop top how we rollin’ down on Collins South Beach
Look like Kelly Rowland, this might be my destiny.
She want me to eat it, I guess dinner’s on me.
Know I got the sauce, like a fucking recipe.

She just wanna do it for the ‘gram
She just want this money in my hand.
Ima give it to her when she dance dance dance.
She gon’ catch an Uber out to Calabasas.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan

I think you got the wrong impression bout me baby, (bout me baby)
Just cause they heard what hood I’m from, they think I’m crazy (they think I’m crazy)
OK, well maybe just a little crazy (just a little)
Cause I admit I’m crazy bout that lady, yea, yea

Finger to the world, it’s fuck you pay me. (I been slavin’)
Run the pussy, cause I’m running out of patience. (no more waitin’)
No, no, bouncing like a yo-yo, 

Livin’ life on fast-forward, but we fuck in slo-mo. (yea)
She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

I can’t wait for the show, oh, oh.
Got that good yea, I know, oh, oh.
You should not be alone, oh, oh
All this drink got me throwed, oh, oh, oh.

Club got me right, and I feel so alive
She don’t want a thing, she don’t wanna be no wife.
She just wanna stay all night, she just wanna sniff the white.
Can’t tell her nothing, no can’t tell her nothing, no.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DaL-Z4dwzI/sddefault.jpg,0.007727225851529955,0.0002624119469919917,29.44692854157961,0.0001341667434787722,0.007989637798521947,0.008123804542000719,2018-05-18,13:00:03,Friday,4,14,66,13,41,75,468,6,69,0,2,10,49,0,2,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.177580169714887,2,"['angry', 'neutral']",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,{},0

The Last Jedi featured even more Taoist & Zen teachings than even The Empire Strikes Back, which I found completely amazing. I have seen the movie three times, and I plan to see it in IMAX 3D next weekend at least once. 

In this video, I share my thoughts on Finn's storyline, Poe's arc, and I spend the remainder of the video talking about Rey, Kylo Ren, and Luke Skywalker's arc in the movie. 

If you are a fan of my Star Wars chats and bringing out the theology present in Star Wars, you will enjoy this Star Wars inspired ""dharma talk"" as I discuss all of the parts of this film that make it my favorite Star Wars film in the entire saga.

MARAUDER ANTS vs. BLACK CRAZY ANTS vs. PHARAOH ANTS: 3 different ant colonies meet in a single place and go to war in such a fascinating way! In this video we explore what happens when three species of ants meet and compete within a large terrarium called the Garden of Eden. Going into an epic battle over food are our Marauder Ants (The Titans) battling off savage Black Crazy ants and Pharaoh Ants who have infiltrated the terrarium!

You will be surprised at how the ants interact and seem to establish an hierarchy within the ant terrarium. I also need your opinions and help with some key questions in the end of the video. Hope you enjoy another epic episode of incredible ant discovery!

As quickly as the Cam'ron and Ma$e beef started, it might be over. The two former Children of the Corn members seemed to be engaged in all out war after Murda dropped the diss song ""The Oracle"" and Cam'ron returned fire last night (Nov. 25), with the track, ""Dinner Time."" But according to a Twitter exchange between the two rappers, all might be well in Harlem World.
Early this morning (Nov. 26), Cam shared a screenshot of a short Twitter conversation he had with Ma$e, on Instagram. ""You still my brother if you would like to be...This was just for bragging rights.

Cam replied, ""Yeah, this was fun.. u still my bro too. Glad I get to brag? ‍♂️ lol. So when you leaving Harlem again? 2mr?"" The Purple Haze rapper captioned the photo, ""Y'all see this it's right ‍♂️ ya man I hope he wit the shits tho.""
So, we guess it's all over. This is definitely not the outcome we were expecting after Ma$e went off on Cam on his new song, ""The Oracle,"" his latest release in what seems like years, offering up visceral lines like, ""Tax know you as the n*ggas that snitch on the Roc/D.C. n*ggas know you as just a n*gga they shot/OG n*ggas don’t have no history with you on the block/And everybody seen the footage I got."" All because he felt some type of way about a line Cam spit on ""It's Killa"" off his new mixtape, The Program.

Cam returned the ether calling Ma$e a fraud and the neighborhood punching bag. ""I'll take it to the beginning/When Corey Wright japped you, Baby Maine yapped you/Roc over here slapped you, you still gave him dap too,"" Killa spit on ""Dinner Time.""

""When I came back with 'Welcome Back' [in 2004], Dame ran up to me like, why don't you and Cam just beef,"" Mase said in the official ""Oracle"" annotations. ""I was like, 'Beef? Why would we beef?' It was the weirdest thing I ever heard. He was like, 'Why don't you and Cam just beef? It'll stay on record, it'll stay on wax.'""

From that moment forward, Mase added, he refrained from responses because he knew the feud wasn't real. The aforementioned line in ""It's Killa,"" however, changed his mind.

The Harlem MC and Diplomats representative teased the The Heatmakerz-produced record on Instagram following the release of ""The Oracle"" and also made the claim that Mase was running a ponzi scheme when he transitioned out of rap to work as a pastor. Cam touches on that in ""Dinner Time,"" as well as calls into question Mase's true roots to Harlem.

But now it appears that will be all we will get. It was fun while it lasted, we guess. #hiphopuniverse #hiphopbeefanalysis

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

Even though they broke up in 2014, John Mayer and Katy Perry STILL get asked about each other during interviews. And that’s no exception for John when he was on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.

It all started when Andy asked John if he had tuned in for Katy Perry’s 4 day YouTube live-stream. .and he replied.. “[...] Yeah I checked in with it. It’s definitely odd to watch your ex girlfriend asleep.” But John had no problems with opening up about how he checks in with people in his life, regardless if they are your ex. He said “It’s like, if you want to text someone… I texted Katy happy birthday. It was 4 in the morning. It was like a post-midnight, haven’t gone to sleep yet, it’s technically your birthday -- send!” He went on to say how you should just reach out to people whenever you want, and to just QUOTE “be a person man”.

Well john is quite a confident person and seems to be pretty candid about just reaching out to people when you want to reach out. Which brings us to twitter, a platform where you can literally reach out to anyone at any time. And some of our most memorable celebrity moments happen on twitter. A fan called into Andy Cohens show to ask John about a flirtatious tweet he sent to nicki minaj. For context the tweet was about how john wonders if Nicki minaj is a fan of him.  QUOTE “I spend an inordinate amount of time per day wondering if Nicki Minaj would like me or not.” which then almost immediately started a twitter conversation between the two when nicki replied with QUOTE “would my body be your wonderland?” with the follow up “...asking for a friend”, and people went nuts. Here’s what john had to say about it.

So now it’s your turn, what do you guys think of John Mayer's approach to stalking your ex and flirting with rappers? Do these tactics work for everyone? Or do you have to be a supertalented superstar to pull it off? Let me know in the comment section down below, I’m Tom Plumley, thanks for watching Newsfeed.

ReBoot:  The Guardian Code recently released on Netflix, yet the series looks and feels nothing like the original classic ReBoot show.  Well, I want to talk about that, and bring up some possibilities to reconcile some of the differences between the two series - for example, where are Ray Tracer, Mouse, Enzo Matrix, and AndrAIa in the new Mainframe?

""From where I’m sitting, this is the last time the company can hike its prices without a significant upgrade in design or camera performance."" That’s how I closed out my review of the last OnePlus smartphone, the OnePlus 5T released in November 2017. Well, wouldn’t ya know it: the OnePlus 6 (announced just moments ago) features an upgraded design, better camera specs, and –yes– a little price hike to go with ‘em. Does the OnePlus 6 bring enough of a boost in quality to justify a price point nearly double the OnePlus One's of 2014? The full conclusion will have to wait for the OnePlus 6 review coming soon; for now, check out my early impressions of the device in the MrMobile OnePlus 6 hands-on!

[ABOUT MRMOBILE'S ONEPLUS 6 HANDS-ON]

MrMobile's OnePlus 6 Hands-On was produced following one day with a OnePlus 6 review device in Mirror Black (6GB/128GB) and a OnePlus 6 review device in Midnight Black (6GB/128GB) at the MrMobile studio in Boston, MA. The devices received one software update each during the hands-on process. All conclusions are preliminary in advance of the full OnePlus 6 review landing later in May 2018.

Not wingsuits were involved in the filming of this video! Josh is only using a two piece tracking suit!

""/ All flights with Phoenix Fly 2 piece tracking suit //

I have wanted to return to Norway since I last visited 6 years ago. It was a beautiful as I remembered. This is a video of adventures there and some flights in Italy. 

Although I feel a strong sense of control, if I am honest with myself I know that this style of flying is finite... and now I am ready for new learning and new adventures with another 'craft'. So much more to learn and explore.

Many thanks to Shane Dunn for the hospitality and sharing knowledge. Also to the VKB for being so welcoming...and for all the Karsk!""

Each year, it drifts an estimated 1.5 inches further away from Earth. And in the process, Earth's rotation is actually slowing down. What if one night, the moon simply disappeared? Would we miss it?

A full moon is on average 14,000 times brighter than the next brightest night-sky object, Venus. So without it, every night would be as dark as a new moon. And star gazing would be spectacular.

But by the next morning, you'd begin to realize just how important the moon is for life on Earth. To start, between the sun, Earth's rotation, and the moon, the moon has the largest influence on Earth's tides.

Without it, high and low tides would shrink by an estimated 75%. This would jeopardize the lives of many types of crabs, mussels, and sea snails that live in tidal zones and disrupt the diets of larger animals who rely on them for food, threatening entire coastal ecosystems in the process. Within a few decades, we would start to see mass population declines in the sea and on land.

One of the largest spawning events in the world occurs in the Great Barrier Reef. Each November in the days following the light of a full moon, coral colonies across the reef — spanning an area larger than the state of New Mexico — release millions of egg and sperm sacs within nearly minutes of one another. Scientists are certain that the full moon plays a role in the timing, but exactly how remains a mystery.

On land, animals like these Red Crabs also use lunar cues to reproduce. After living most of their lives in the mountains, millions of adult crabs migrate down to shore. And then, only during the last quarter of the moon, females release their eggs into the sea.

Now, the moon may not hold as much sway over human reproduction. But without it, something else we care equally about would change — the weather. Tides and tidal currents help mix cold arctic waters with warmer waters in the tropics. This balances temperatures and stabilizes the climate worldwide. Without the moon, weather forecasts would be practically impossible. The average difference between the hottest and coldest places on Earth could grow to life-threatening extremes.

But none of this compares to the biggest change that we would have coming over the next millennia. Right now, Earth tilts on its axis at 23.5º mostly due to the moon's gravity. If the moon disappeared, Earth's axis would wobble between anywhere from 10 to 45º.

Some experts estimate that Jupiter could help keep Earth's tilt from reeling completely out of control. But even just an extra 10º tilt could wreak havoc on the climate and seasons.
In the past, Earth's tilt has changed by about 1-2º, which scientists think could have caused Ice Ages in the past. It's hard to know what a 10º or 45º tilt would do but probably nothing good for most life on Earth.

The moon isn't just imperative for life on Earth today. Experts believe that it may also have played a key role in the formation of life more than 3.5 billion years ago. Turns out, the moon isn't just a beacon of light in the night sky. Its existence is crucial to the delicate balancing act that makes life here possible.

When actors reach a certain level of fame, they gain the ability to shape a movie to their own whims, either as a result of their experience or simply their sheer star power. Sometimes these changes barely affect the movie, but other times they completely change the final product—for better or worse. Here are some of the most ridiculous examples of movies that were significantly altered by actors' demands...

It is much faster and more energy efficient. And we will compare it to LoRa (RFM95 and Arduino Pro Mini.

Espressif gave us this possibility and, because it is so fast, they called it ESPnow. And it also works in the Arduino IDE.
In this video, we will
- Try to understand the difference between the standard ESP mode and ESPnow
- Build a working ESPnow connection for two ESP8266
- Check-out the transmission speed and
- Compare this speed with the speed if we connect the ESP to the internet
- Compare the Energy hunger of both modes
- And finally, compare the ESPs with another technology: LoRa

Thousands of black laborers across the South were forced to work against their will as late as the 1960s—a new form of enslavement that went on in the shadows of rural America.

VICE's Akil Gibbons traveled to Louisiana to meet genealogist Antoinette Harrell, the “slavery detective of the South,"" who tracks down cases of modern-day slavery and abusive labor practices. They talk to a man whose family was held on a plantation against their will into the 1950s, and Antoinette explains how she uses decades-old records to uncover how slavery was perpetuated long after the Civil War ended.

North Korea is famous for being a hermit kingdom. Under the strict control of the Communist Party and dictator Kim Jong-un, the military shows unwavering dedication to the government. However, many soldiers try to defect across the Demilitarized Zone or the country’s northern border with China. The successful defectors often share horrific tales of life in North Korea. Military service is mandatory, even for women. And in this country, women’s rights are virtually non-existent. They have to deal with that grim reality on top of the malnutrition and poor sanitation that they face. Many South Koreans were enamored by the North’s Army of Beauties, who acted as cheerleaders during the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. In this video, you'll hear about the strange practices of North Korea’s military. You'll also uncover The Horrible Things North Korean FEMALE Soldiers Have To Endure. Despite Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in’s historic peace talks, women in North Korea still endure terrible conditions.

Let's Answer the very Simple Question Of the Day, #How #to #Make A Perfect #steak #sandwich?
Answered By #Gordon #Ramsay :
These are effectively very posh burgers. You take a rare beef fillet, add homemade
relish and mustard mayonnaise, and sandwich it between two pieces of
toasted ciabatta. Heaven! It’s very important to start the beef on the hob because
meat that goes straight in the oven looks boiled rather than beautifully
caramelised.
Olive oil, for frying
700g fillet of beef
1 whole head of garlic, cut in half horizontally
3–4 thyme sprigs
Butter
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 baby gem lettuce, to serve
FOR THE SPICY TOMATO RELISH
Olive oil, for frying
½ red onion, peeled and finely chopped
2 red chillies, deseeded and chopped
250g mixed red and yellow cherry tomatoes, halved
1–2 tsp sherry vinegar, to taste
Small handful of shredded basil leaves
FOR THE MUSTARD MAYONNAISE
3 tbsp good-quality mayonnaise
3 tsp wholegrain mustard
FOR THE TOASTED CIABATTA
12 slices of ciabatta, about 1.5cm thick
2–3 tbsp olive oil
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6.
2. Heat a large ovenproof frying pan until hot and add a glug of oil. Grind a generous
amount of salt and pepper onto a board and roll the fillet in the seasoning. Fry over a high
heat for 1–2 minutes on each side until gently coloured all over, including the ends. Add
the garlic and thyme sprigs, heat for a minute, then sit the beef on top of them. Add a
couple of knobs of butter, spooning it over the steak to baste.
3. Place the beef in the preheated oven and roast for 15–17 minutes until rare or medium
rare. It should feel springy when pressed. Remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil
and leave to rest for 15 minutes, basting now and again with the juices from the pan.
4. Meanwhile, make the relish. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and
chillies and fry over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until softened. Stir in the tomatoes,
then season and cook for 6–8 minutes until the tomatoes are beginning to collapse. Add
the vinegar and stew down over a medium heat for about 6 minutes until reduced to a
rough relish consistency. Remove from the heat, stir in the basil and season well. Tip into a
serving bowl and set aside.
5. Combine the ingredients for the mustard mayonnaise. Season, then spoon into a serving
bowl and set aside.
6. To make the toast, heat a griddle pan until smoking hot. Drizzle the sliced ciabatta with
the olive oil, season and then griddle for 1–2 minutes until golden on both sides. Repeat
until all the bread is toasted and then place on a serving platter.
7. To serve, thickly slice the rested fillet of beef, place on a platter and put on the table
with the toast, mayonnaise, relish and lettuce leaves to be assembled by your guests.

Please Note: This Video Contains Spoilers For The Last Jedi.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a certified hit. The film secured the second biggest domestic opening weekend of all time, after only The Force Awakens, and it earned a stellar 93% rating on RottenTomatoes. From critics, that is. Audiences only gave it a 55%, with Star Wars fans quickly taking sides. Sure, there are some things almost everyone can agree on: the movie was beautiful to look at, Adam Driver gave his best performance yet as Kylo Ren, and the porgs weren't nearly as annoying as some people feared. But there are still plenty of other things to argue about. Here's a spoiler filled look at why audiences are split on The Last Jedi...

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Jermaine Sneed - Can you settle a debate for me? Is saying a movie has a twist a spoiler? I mean if I tell you (Spoiler alert here..maybe?) The 6th sense has a twist. But not the actual twist, is that spoilery? Are does it alter the viewing experience because now the person is looking out for it and that’s bad enough?

Stephen - Did you hear that Uwe Boll went off on the new Rampage movie saying, and I quote ""You Uwe Boll off, then you get the tribunals."" and is threatening to sue Warner bros.? This guy is a class A asswhole. Thanks, and bring on the filthy!

Dan Sokolov - Do you think franchises kill actor’s career after they end? No one is talking about Christian Bale after the Dark Knight; Toby McGuire disappeared after Spider-Man; Pretty much everyone has disappeared after the LOTR movies. Do you think the same fate awaits RDJ?

The World Of 5 - Early box office projections (thanks to Box Office Pro) has Solo opening with a $150 million debut and finished around $390 million domestically. I know these are early projections and don't really mean anything right now, but what do you think Solo will opened up to?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6VpBhHrAgnE/hqdefault.jpg,0.03118365642292834,0.0030278773535655865,10.298850574712645,0.011206626526989873,0.034211533776493934,0.0454181603034838,2018-03-31,18:25:53,Saturday,5,13,15,13,15,71,112,2,25,1,1,11,15,3,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.598020657456236,3,"['scared', 'neutral', 'happy']",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

lyrics:

(verse 1)
i need emotion novocaine
i need a numbing of my brain
i need something
to take away
the remains of ur name

i need amnesia for a day
& an umbrella for the rain
that hasn't gone away
since u said u didn't need me

lately,
been thinking maybe
there's a place we
won't feel so crazy

then in a hazy
mid-morning daydream
i found a shady
spot that they saved me

they said

(hook)
come be the newest member of
the broken hearts club
we hate every little thing
about the people that we loved
we’re the let down, we’re the lied to
where the lost go
when it finds u
where the lonely,
make the lonely,
feel less lonely
& we’re dying to
invite u to stay
& take away the pain
cuz misery loves company
so hey, what do u say?

(verse 2)
& at first i wasn't sure
if there's even a cure
for what i'm feeling cuz what i'm feeling’s
been feeling more & more absurd
the repeating in my head
of every last word that u said
feels like ever since u left
u still won't leave me

& lately,
been thinkin maybe
there might be a place we
won't feel so crazy

for changing
the way u made me
& in a daydream,
i let them save me

(hook)
i'm the newest member of
the broken hearts club
we hate every little thing
about the people that we loved
we're the let down, we're the lied to
where the lost go
when it finds u
where the lonely,
make the lonely,
feel less lonely
& we’re dying to
invite u to stay
& take away the pain
cuz misery loves company
so hey, what do u say?

(bridge)
i guess
if u can't beat 'em join 'em
that's what they always say
let's go inside, let's coincide,
& all commiserate

singing

(hook)
we're the newest members
of the broken hearts club
we still feel pretty lonely
& we wish we didn't but
we're the newest of
the broken hearts club
& we all kinda hate it
but it's easier than love
singing
we're the newest members
of the broken hearts club
& we still feel pretty lonely
& we wish we didn't but
we're the newest of
the broken hearts club
& we all kinda hate it
but it's easier than love

The first method is an easy one to start using early in the game since it's in the Cap Kingdom! All you need to do is find the cap door, capture a frog, and then jump a bunch of times. This is the 2nd best method I know of and will allow you to collect 9999 coins in about an hour and 15 minutes!

The second method is super simple and takes place in the Wooded Kingdom. Even though this method is slower than the first, it's super simple to pull off. Just teleport to the flower field entrance, capture the coin frog thing, and repeat!

The third and final method is extremely fast and takes place in Bowser's Kingdom. This is only available after beating the main game. Find the acorn (seed), throw it in the plant pot, and proceed to speed through the flower obstacle course while collecting tons of coins! If you do it flawlessly, you'll get 180 coins in just under a minute. Doing this consistently will get you 9999 coins in under an hour (~55 minutes).

There are plenty of ways to collect coins quickly in Super Mario Odyssey, but these are 3 of the quickest ways I have heard of. Once you get all of that sweet gold, you can head to the nearest Crazy Cap shop and buy that awesome skeleton costume you've been saving for. If you already have the costume, feel free to buy the other costumes, stickers, props, and power moons!

Have any methods of your own or other ideas for Super Mario Odyssey (SMO) videos and tutorials? Let me know down below in the comments!

When Ernest Cline's novel Ready Player One came out in 2011, it was quickly dubbed the ""holy grail of pop culture"" thanks to the truck loads of pop culture references and Easter eggs stuffed inside its pages. The entire story is one big search for a literal egg, so that should tell you something. True to its roots, Steven Spielberg's film is also a basketful. Ready Player One is so full of pop culture references that you'd be hard pressed to spot them all with ten viewings, let alone just one. Here are all the Easter eggs we found in Ready Player One. Spoilers ahead, even if you've read the book…

6XhfWyEXqqU,lE0eWRdSrY4,Why North Korea Agreed To Meet With Trump,Business Insider,25.0,2018-03-29 15:00:00+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'north korea', 'trump', 'international politics', 'kim jong un', 'sanctions', 'nuclear weapons', 'negotiations']",790984.0,6469.0,713.0,1600.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6XhfWyEXqqU/default.jpg,"Ji Seong-ho is a North Korean defector currently residing in South Korea. He now runs an organization 'NAUH' helping other North Koreans escape. Here's why he thinks North Korea suddenly agreed to a meeting with Trump.

Below is the following transcript:

Ji Seong-ho: North Korea is simply trying to buy more time. They aren't willing to give up their nuclear program but are growing weary of the joint military exercises and the anger of the American public and its government. The same goes for Trump's government. To ensure the security of the nation, negotiating with North Korea concerning their nuclear program and disarming this threat is their highest priority. And it's come to ap oint where they feel the need to take real action against North Korea.

And this is troubling new for North Korea and they are quite scared as well. In reality, if you take a look at North Korea, it's the government that's afraid of staring a war, not the people. The people can survive through wars but the North Korean government survives by exploiting its people and bullying other countries. It's a good life for them but starting a war would endanger all of that, not to mention their lives. Although North Korea likes to brag about their successful missile launches and nuclear tests, they still need more time to complete their program. I think this meeting is to buy that very time.

Also Kim Jong-Un is being pressured to make a move as the public sentiment towards him is very bad. Kim Jong-Un promised his people a paradise to live in in just five years. His father said the same thing and so did his father before him. The people were unsure whether he could be trusted but gave him a chance nonetheless. In the end, Kim Jong-Un couldn't keep his promise. On top of that, the trade sanctions have increased the living costs and made the lives harder for the people. To these people who are used to surviving without aid from their government, they can't understand its obsession with the nuclear program.

And Kim Jong-Un has to resolve this by making a cooperative gesture towards the world. Last year, after their sixth successful test, they declared themselves a nuclear power and promised the end of famine for all its people. Less than a week later, they contradicted themselves by warning people of another possible famine in the near-future. People are growing upset over the incompetence of their government. People are pressuring the government to take real actions and Kim Jong-Un tried to ease this tension at home during the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, gesturing for harmony with South Korea and giving people hopes for more foreign aids and increase in their quality of lives.

With everyone having different agendas for this meeting, everything depends on North Korea's attitude. I think for a change to come out of this meeting, North Korea must accept its own mistakes and be open to ending their nuclear program.

Selgoddess has spoken! And she even revealed why she’s still friends with The Weeknd.   
Selena Gomez is gracing the new cover of Billboard because she was just named Women of The Year and you guys look at this Cover. Can Selgo be any more perfect?  
The answer is yes because she’s finally giving us answers to questions we’ve had ever since her split with The Weeknd and rekindling with the Biebs. 
She first opened up about Justin coming back into her life by saying ""I'm 25. I'm not 18, or 19, or 20. I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn't right. But that doesn't mean caring for someone ever goes away. And [that goes for] people in general,"" The former Wizards of Waverly Place then goes on to cite Disney Channel alums like Miley Cyrus, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato and says ""We've gone through seasons in our lives. I don't think it's as serious as people make things out to be half the time. It's just my life. I grew up with all of these people, and it's so cool to see where everybody is."" 
Not only did she finally reveal how she feels about reuniting with the Biebs, but the interview gets even more interesting when she mentions her ex-boyfriend of 10 months, The Weeknd.  The Wolves singer reveals she’s really proud of herself for still being able to keep a true friendship with The Weeknd even after they called it quits. 
""I truly have never experienced anything like that in my life. We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other] ""And that was pretty remarkable for me.""
Which sounds really nice, but I also gotta let you guys know this interview was conducted before Selena and The Weeknd both unfollowed each other on social media. So not so sure how much that statement holds up but all we can do is wish for the best for those two. 
Selena’s definitely gone through a lot of changes this year with her kidney transplant and battling Lupus and has decided to make more control of her career. I want to leave you guys with one last quote from her interview. She says:
I handle things in a healthy way. I can enjoy where I'm at. I love being able to say 'no.' I like being a part of the world,"" she said. ""People are so terrified of other people. I see it in my generation a lot. There's so much anxiety and angst, and the pressure just keeps getting worse. [But] I'm proudest of not becoming jaded. I have every reason to be like, 'F--k all of you.' And I don't. I'm going to have the bad days where I don't want to leave my bedroom—but I'm ready for them."" 

Selena continues to remain an inspiration and role model to us all. 
But now it’s time to kick it over to you guys.  What did you think of what Selena said about Justin coming back into her life AND what are your thoughts on the current state of her relationship with her ex, The Weeknd? Let us know in the comment section below and please hit me up on Instagram @nazperez and let a girl know if you’re pro or against Jelena. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Naz Perez and I’ll see you next time.

On Friday, Azealia slammed Cardi in an interview, calling her an “illiterate rat” and a “caricature of a black woman.” Cardi shot back on Instagram saying, “This is coming from a woman that bleached her skin… I’m not apologizing or killing myself because of who I am.”

Then, Meghan Markle's father was caught allegedly staging paparazzi photos just days before the royal wedding.

Plus, Tina Knowles spoke to Maria Shriver about sending her daughters to counseling at a young age and making sure Solange didn’t get lost in Beyoncé’s shadow.

And, the campaign to “Mute R. Kelly” is working. Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music have decided to “bury” R. Kelly’s music on their sites.

‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ directed by Rian Johnson and starring Daisy Ridley, Andy Serkis, Gwendoline Christie, Domhnall Gleeson, Mark Hamill, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran comes out on December 15th. So much happened in ‘The Last Jedi’ that challenged, changed and altered the course of the franchise that you may have been asking a lot of questions afterwards. Don’t worry, you were not alone. Jedi Council’s Kristian Harloff and Ken Napzok have seen the movie more than once and are here to ask 7 Questions about the movies and give you their answers to them. They expound on what these answers might mean for what we might see in the next film and in the franchise going forward.

See if Kristian and Ken ask and answer any of the questions you had after watching ‘The Last Jedi’. Also, if any of your questions weren’t addressed in this video, drop them in the Comments section below and have a discussion with fellow Star Wars and Collider fans.

This was one of our favorite episodes of World Record Wednesday. Even though we hate it when a record takes a long time...we love to the process, the hustle, and the struggle. It makes achieving it feel so much better. Which was your favorite record? Donuts? Flip Flops? Or Foot race?

Please sign up for our SkillShare! Doing so could potentially help get World Record Wednesdays an on-going sponsor which would mean more cooler and crazier videos for YOU!

Juju Smith Schuster is a truly modern phenomenon, part NFL rookie, and part social media star. While smashing records on the football field, he's also managed to break records online. Like, when he nearly doubled the previous record for most concurrent viewers on Twitch, playing Fortnite with Travis Scott, Drake and Ninja. The stream peaked at 628 thousand.

I’ve recently started playing Warframe a game which I have put off for over 3 years due to my fear of pay to win mechaincs blocking my progression. Well, I finally gave Warframe the time it deserves and oh my gosh… it is brilliant. 

Sadly the user interface and the way things are explained are crippling the experience for new players so I thought I’d produce a 2018 beginners guide as I progress through the game and hopefully convince you to add this to your library or give it a little more time if you gave up years ago.

Check out our ""7 Celebrities Who Gave Their Kids Up For Adoption"" video at: https://youtu.be/vVrlJFZ8sME

14. Serval
Let's start off with easily one of the most exotic cats out there, the Serval. You'd be forgiven for not knowing about this special cat, as it's from Africa. But what I told you that the Serval is actually pretty popular in the US as a pet? It's true.

13. Peterbald
Here's a unique cat that will make you do a double take. the Peterbald are a species of cat that are found mostly in Russia, and have a trait of not having hair. So they're quite literally bald cats. Though, to be fair, not all of them are bald, some do get hair, but they do often lose it.

12. Korat
Though cats are accepted in most cultures in the world, that doesn't mean they don't get their fair share of superstitions attached to them. A black cat for example can be viewed as bad luck, but also, there are good luck cats. One of which is the Korat.

11. Caracals
Heading back to the exotic kinds of cats, the Caracals is one that is both stunning to look at, and is very interesting in terms of how it acts. You see, Caracals are a type of Lynx, another exotic cat that has been known to have some aggressive tendencies at times. Because of this, you might think that the Caracals are the same , but you would be wrong.

10. The Norwegian Forest Cat
Here's a cat story you might like. The Norwegian Forest Cat is a breed of cat that is very popular in Europe. However, during World War II, this particular cat was almost made extinct. It survived however due to the efforts of the Norwegian Forest Cat Club.

9. Serengeti
Sometimes, you're not born into the world an original, you're created, and cats have been breed that way for a long time believe it or not. A great example of this is the Serengeti. This species is a recent addition to the cat world, as they were ""developed"" in the 1990's by crossing the Bengal and Oriental Shorthair species.

8. Ocelot
Ocelot's are one of the more known exotic species of cats in the world. Mainly because they're gorgeous, and people have tried to make them pets for quite some time...with mixed results. Have you ever seen Archer? Yeah, that's a good example of how not to raise an Ocelot.

7.  Ragamuffin
While this may have an odd name, the Ragamuffin is surprising unique in terms of other cats. This particular breed was only recognized in 2003, but has taken the cat world by storm since then. It's a mix of specials including the Ragdoll and certain breeds of street cat, but when you look and touch its fur and see its eyes, it's clear how special it is.

6. Geoffroy's Cat
From a rather big domestic cat to a very small exotic one, let's talk about Geoffroy's Cat. No, this isn't a cat owned by a specific person, but a whole species, and one that measure in as one of the smallest cats on Earth, to the extent that when they're fully grown they only weight at max eight pounds.

5. California Spangled
Developed in the US at the ""urging"" of anthropologist Louis Leaky, the California Spangled is now one of the rarest cats in the world today. Proving that even cat breeds can go out of style.
As you can see, the California Spangled was made to resemble the cats of Africa.

4. British Shorthair
It's well known that cats live long lives, and have been around for a VERY long time. But this species is one of the oldest known cat breeds ever, the British Shorthair. This cat is so revered in the UK that it's inspired many things, not the least of which was the look of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland. Plus, it's the most pedigreed breed in the country.

3. Turkish Van
This one deserves a special spot on my list because of its unique fur and personality. Anyone who's raised a cat knows that though they drink water, they don't bathe in it, right? And only jungle cats will swim in water, right? Wrong! Meet, the Turkish.

2. Egyptian Mau
Another cat that looks like a jungle cat, the Egyptian Mau is unique because its spots are actually natural to it. No breeding or development required. But that's only the start of what makes this cat so special.

1. Bombay
If you have been paying attention, you'll have noticed that people really want miniaturized versions of wild big cats like Lynxs, bobcats, jaguars, lions, etc. Another cat that people have apparently wanted to ""miniaturize"" is the panther. And because of that, the Bombay was breed.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6btQUn_NAcI/sddefault.jpg,0.011523635515893456,0.0009132403587179213,12.618403693931398,0.001692747630605118,0.012436875874611376,0.014129623505216496,2018-04-26,13:00:00,Thursday,3,7,51,7,51,34,515,1,154,1,0,5,0,2,0,4.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.8708956946835285,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'cat': 1},1

Since filming this video, I have been playing around with this foundation a little more. I personally love using it to blend out stick foundations? I find it works really nicely!

Lyrics 

Tripping on the sidewalk
Living like a cyclone
Was I in your heart guess I never know where you go
Harsh words in the headlamps time to leave
Dressing like a psycho
Walking on the tightrope
Funky like a monkey with my makeup running
Too proud to find no time to breath

My baby’s always threating to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I’ve never been clear
Honey you better believe now that there’s nothing to fear
You can just leave

Talking like I’m tanked up 
Reading from the black book
Everyone you know is a holy ghost sinner
You look away as they crucify me
Sleeping in the wreckage
Loaded like a weapon
Bombing down Dracena like the end is coming 
I prophesied that you’ll miss the highs with me


My baby’s always threating to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I’ve never been clear
Honey you better believe now that there’s nothing to fear
You can just leave

Would you say my prayers, If I came here ill prepared?
You can paint it all black cause you’re never gonna get it clean
When it’s easier to leave
When it’s easier to leave
Too tired to try to let it go

My baby’s always threating to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
Too tired to try to let it go
You said I’ve never been clear
Honey you better believe now that there’s nothing to fear
You can just leave
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6e53GyXCgys/sddefault.jpg,0.01912274087759238,0.0003228433543216228,59.23225806451613,0.0011164131478476763,0.019445584231914004,0.020561997379761682,2018-05-08,13:00:00,Tuesday,1,4,6,4,6,19,52,1,19,0,1,3,5,0,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.5207311157555985,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'traffic light': 4, 'car': 2, 'person': 1}",7

Showcasing a stunning score from Academy & Tony Award-winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land, Dear Evan Hansen), THE GREATEST SHOWMAN stars Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya, and arrives in UK cinemas BOXING DAY.

I have said that I am going to review the new Shape Tape Foundation, but Tarte has made this a complicated decision...

*Update*
It looks like the Shape Tape Hydrating Foundation has the exact same ingredients as their Hydra Gel Foundation. Per a tweet from Tarte, they are the same formula, but the way they mixed, packaged, and cured the product changes the texture, application, and finish. 

I absolutely, 100% do NOT think that Tarte has ANY excuse for not creating a broad shade range at launch. They have had this formula for a year and a half.

Also, based on trusted sources, I no longer believe the brands that told me that deeper shades are harder to formulate. I now believe that is just an excuse to not formulate deeper shades and I'm REALLY upset that I not only believed them, but also put that info into a video.

Thanks for subscribing to my channel (https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=jenluvsreviews) ! I specialize in thorough makeup reviews (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) that give you WAY more than the typical YouTube review including ingredient analysis, close up finger/brush swatches, and MORE!

FTC: This is not a sponsored video...obviously.

A note about the sponsored video - If they had accepted me, I would have been under contract by the time I saw Alissa's video, so the video would have been produced. Seeing in ""real life"" how bad the swatches were and hearing Alissa's thoughts in combination with Tarte's words to PopSugar are what turned me against a full review on the channel.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ezzBv15ko4/sddefault.jpg,0.0787087724100178,0.007338853154509373,10.724941724941727,0.02521554673600657,0.08604762556452716,0.11126317230053373,2018-01-17,19:20:48,Wednesday,2,10,3,10,3,48,38,2,10,2,0,8,0,3,0,4.0,12.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.665048757832768,15,"['happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'neutral', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,14,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

News of this “smallfoot” brings him fame and a chance with the girl of his dreams.  It also throws the simple Yeti community into an uproar over what else might be out there in the big world beyond their snowy village, in a rollicking story about friendship, courage and the joy of discovery. 
 
“Smallfoot” stars Channing Tatum (“The LEGO® Batman Movie,” the “Jump Street” films) as the Yeti, Migo, and James Corden (“Trolls,” “The Emoji Movie”) as the Smallfoot, Percy.  Also starring are Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming”), Common (“Selma”), LeBron James (upcoming “Space Jam 2”), Gina Rodriguez (“Jane the Virgin”), Danny DeVito (“The Lorax,” Oscar nominee for “Erin Brockovich”), Yara Shahidi (TV’s “Black-ish”), Ely Henry (TV’s “Justice League Action”), and Jimmy Tatro (“22 Jump Street”).

“Smallfoot” is directed by Karey Kirkpatrick, Annie Award-winning director of “Over the Hedge” and Annie nominee for the screenplays for “Chicken Run” and “James and the Giant Peach.”  The film is produced by Bonne Radford (“Curious George”), Glenn Ficarra (“Storks,” “The is Us,”) and John Requa (“Storks,” “This is Us”).  Serving as executive producers are Nicholas Stoller, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Jared Stern, Sergio Pablos, and Kirkpatrick. The creative team includes editor Peter Ettinger, and composer Heitor Pereira. 

The film is set to debut in cinemas October 5, 2018.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Animation Group, “Smallfoot” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

INGREDIENTS:
1 lb of ground beef 
1 egg 
¼ cup of finely crushed potato chips 
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce 
⅛ tsp cayenne pepper 
White pearl onions  
Hamburger buns with sesame seeds 
1 olive 
American cheese 
Ketchup 
1 slice of Bologna

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6fw5XnJpOXQ/sddefault.jpg,0.006888051366708642,0.00021358298811499662,32.25,0.00037377022920124413,0.007101634354823637,0.007475404584024881,2018-04-20,08:45:02,Friday,4,9,37,9,32,58,330,3,76,0,1,7,16,3,0,6.0,8.0,"['ie', '| BROADWAY']","['ie', '|', 'BROADWAY']",True,"['ie', '|', 'broadway']",3,3,11,1,0,0,0,6.414664770189546,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Makes 12 Lemons / Make 3 days ahead.
This dessert is first glazed with a thin cocoa butter-white chocolate coating, then air sprayed with the same coating to create a velvet effect and sprayed again with hot neutral or apricot glaze to resemble citrus fruit skin, then it is lightly pigmented with a Kirsch and gold powder solution.

Poached Meyer Lemon (semi-confit lemon)
1 lb. (450g) Meyer lemon (weigh lemon once prepared)
2 lb. (900g) sugar
2 lb. (900g) water.

Method
Remove stems and cut each lemon into 8 wedges. Trim wedges and remove and discard any excess membranes and seeds as well.
In order to remove its bitterness, lemons need to be blanched; place lemon wedges in a saucepan and cover with cold water, bring to boil and drain. Repeat this step twice. Cover the blanched lemon wedges with the sugar and water. Bring to boil and cook very slowly for 4 to 5 hours at 195ºF (85/90ºC). Once poached through, drain the lemons. Lemon wedges can also be poached using the sous-vide method at 160ºF (70ºC).
Save up syrup and cook it to 218ºF (103ºC) – Let cool and pour over the poached lemons to cover. Wrap up and store in the refrigerator for months.

Lemon Marmalade Inserts
*Lemon Jelly
0.7 cup (180g) lemon juice
1/3 cup (80g) water
1/4 cup (50g) sugar
10 grams agar-agar.
Inserts
7 ounces (220g) poached Meyer lemons, cut into cubes
2 ounces (60g) finger lime (lemon caviar), seeds removed
1.5 ounces (45g) lemon supremes ≈ 2 or 3 lemons
6 grams fresh mint, minced.

Method
For the lemon jelly, heat up lemon juice and water. Mix together the sugar and agar-agar and sprinkle over the hot liquid whisking swiftly, bring to boil and cook 2 min. Remove from the heat; chill completely. Meanwhile, cut out finger limes crosswise in order to squeeze out its caviar, remove some of the larger seeds and set aside. Cube the poached lemon wedges, remove supreme (flesh only) from 2 or 3 lemons, chopped roughly and set aside.
For the marmalade, smooth out the chilled lemon jelly using an immersion blender giving just a couple of pulses. Fold in the cubed poached lemons, lemon supreme, finger lime, and mint. Scoop out and fill the mini demi-sphere silicone mold (1Tbsp/15g) and freeze completely. Unmold and seal them by two forming one ounce (30g) inserts; keep frozen.

Yuzu Mousse / Ganache Montée
1 pint (480g) heavy cream /divide in two equal portions
3 grams gelatin sheet
4.7 ounces (140g) white chocolat
1/2 cup (120g) yuzu*

*About the size of a tangerine, yuzu is mainly cultivated in Japan, Korea, and China. It's incredibly fragrant just like lemon or lime juice. It adds acidity and freshness to mousse, dressing and so on.

Method
Soak gelatin sheet in cold water for about 5 minutes or until softened; drain and set aside. Meanwhile, boil half of the heavy cream, add white chocolate and the soften gelatin and blend. Add the remaining and chilled heavy cream; blend. Add yuzu juice and give a good emulsion and refrigerate for 12 hours. With the whisk attachment, beat chilled yuzu ganache until soft peaks and pipe out.

6gmDysmpLFE,5AGyFelwyk4,Steve Kerr: LaVar Ball is a 'Kardashian of the NBA' and 'laughing at all of us' in Lithuania,KNBR,17.0,2018-01-09 02:23:28+00:00,"['#KNBR', 'steve kerr', 'lavar ball', 'rick carslile', 'luke walton', 'lonzo ball']",56975.0,520.0,20.0,223.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6gmDysmpLFE/default.jpg,"OAKLAND--The Warriors have a handful of players with very famous parents.

Dell Curry was an NBA sharpshooter, Mychal Thompson is a two-time NBA champion and Wanda Durant is the ""Real MVP.""

But the combined star power of all Warriors' parents pales in comparison to that of LaVar Ball, the father of Los Angeles Lakers' point guard Lonzo Ball who's every sneeze creates headlines. Regardless of whether society should pay attention to Ball (we shouldn't), when he talks, people listen. And when Ball says something of consequence --like he did when told ESPN's Jeff Goodman that Lakers' coach Luke Walton has lost his team-- it evolves into a firestorm.

Why is Ball a story? Warriors' head coach Steve Kerr analyzed the situation on Monday night.

""I've talked to people in the media this year, I've said, 'Why do you guys have to cover that guy,'"" Kerr said. ""They say, well we don't want to. Nobody wants to. Our bosses tell us we have to because of the ratings. Somewhere, I guess in Lithuania, LaVar Ball is laughing at all of us. People are eating out of his hands for no apparent reason. Other than he's become like a Kardashian of the NBA or something and that sells. That's what is true in politics and entertainment and now in sports. It doesn't matter if there's any substance involved with an issue. It's just, can we make it interesting for no apparent reason? There's nothing interesting about that story.""

The Warriors' fourth-year head coach worked for ESPN as a commentator, but is dismayed by the role his former employer and several other media entities have played in granting Ball a leading voice. Kerr, like every other NBA coach, wishes Ball didn't receive coverage because it takes away from the important stories that could do a greater service for the public.

""This is the world we live in now,"" Kerr said. ""I was thinking about ESPN and they laid off, I don't know, 100 people, how many people did they lay off over the last year? Well over 100. Many of whom were really talented journalists covering the NBA. This is not an ESPN judgment, it's a societal thing more than anything. Where we're going is we're going away from covering the game and we're getting over to just sensationalized news. It's not even news really, it's complete nonsense. But if you package that irrational nonsense with some glitter and some ribbon, people are going to watch.""

Ball has turned himself into the center of attention at each level of his sons' development. At the high school level, Ball's criticism played a role in coaching overturn at Chino Hills in Southern California. Once his oldest son Lonzo left UCLA, his middle son LaMelo was involved in a shoplifting incident on a team trip to China before Ball pulled his son from the university. Now, he's taken LaMelo and his youngest son LiAngelo to Lithuania to play professionally in Europe, and created even more distractions around each turn.

Even though he's halfway across the globe, Ball still found time to criticize Walton's handling of the Lakers, which Kerr said is an unfortunate reality of the job in Los Angeles.

""I feel horrible for Luke, that's my guy,"" Kerr said. ""He's one of my best friends. He shouldn't have to deal with this. To me, one of the things about the NBA, it's always been a haven from the parents. The guys who coach high school are the ones that really have to deal with the parents. I've never had to talk to a parent that's upset about playing time. I'm sure there are many out there, but they don't have a voice in the NBA. But for whatever reason, we're giving this guy a voice and Luke's got to deal with it and it's a shame.""

Kerr's point about the separation between parents and playing time in the NBA carries a separation of church and state like appeal. There's never been this much attention paid to the father of an NBA player, even if a mother or father did feel their son deserved more minutes. Now, Ball controls very specific messages, and Kerr believes he's doing great harm to his son Lonzo, the NBA, and journalists who cover the league.

""You know how many parents of my players have been at home, 'Why isn't he playing my kid,' and yet we're sticking a microphone in front of his (Ball) face and apparently it gets ratings,"" Kerr said. ""I don't know who cares, but people care. They must care or ESPN wouldn't be spending whatever they're spending to send reporters to Lithuania when they're laying off people who are writing really substantial (pieces). People like Ethan Strauss and Mark Stein are getting laid off. This is not a condemnation of ESPN, it's not. It's a societal issue. It's been going on for many, many years and it's really invading the sports world.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6gmDysmpLFE/sddefault.jpg,0.00912681000438789,0.00035103115401491884,26.0,0.0039139973672663465,0.009477841158402807,0.013391838525669155,2018-01-09,02:23:28,Tuesday,1,18,11,17,11,92,83,5,20,1,1,5,0,9,0,4.0,7.0,"['art = _', 'a) a ie', 'Nd iI} Te', '', 'in', '', 'Pore', '', 'IRACLE', '', 'Tera', '', 'feat].', 'at]']","['art', '=', '_', 'a)', 'a', 'ie', 'Nd', 'iI}', 'Te', 'in', 'Pore', 'IRACLE', 'Tera', 'feat].', 'at]']",True,"['art', '=', '_', 'a', ')', 'a', 'ie', 'Nd', 'iI', '}', 'Te', 'in', 'pore', 'iracl', 'tera', 'feat', ']', '.', 'at', ']']",20,18,41,7,0,2,4,6.502362355070553,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Our Model 3 was delivered yesterday morning! Tesla let us know that we had the honor of being the very first regular customers to take delivery. My significant other and I are thrilled beyond belief and we're just blown away by the car and company. Folks on Reddit asked for a video, so here it is!

With Model 3, Tesla has made a masterpiece. I still love the S an X, but the Model 3 is the car that just put every other car manufacturer on notice.

If you enjoyed my video and free unlimited supercharging for life on an S or X, you can use my link: http://ts.la/budd7594. If 50 people order through my link, I might even get a new Roadster, and I promise to make an even better video of it ;)

Let me know if you guys have any questions or would like to see anything else I left out of the video.

Thank you so much to Tesla and the man of the century, Elon Musk!

Primer single del que será el SEXTO ÁLBUM de HAZE. Con la colaboración de Barroso. Esta canción nace de la necesidad, de la lucha y del orgullo de los que somos humildes. Es un canto dirigido a nuestros barrios, con el fin de que en ellos, aquellos que hemos vivido situaciones difíciles, encontremos las ganas de luchar por nuestros sueños. Somos GRANDES. 

Álbum: Esencia
Canción: “Esencia”
Colabora: Barroso
Letra: Haze 
Música: Kike Rodríguez & Mees Bickle 
Guitarra flamenca: Fran Cortés

Intro (HAZE)
Cuando convives con las mil caras de la violencia,
te desprendes de toda máscara
y sólo queda tu esencia. 

Estribillo (BARROSO)
No tenemos dinero ni miedo ni estamos robando.
Para poder conseguir nuestro sueño seguimos luchando.
Nos sentimos orgullosos de ser gente humilde de barrio.
No vamos a rendirnos;
Moriremos peleando. 

Puente musical (HAZE)
Y yo quiero ver a mi familia gozando. 
Quiero que sonría, que deje de vivir penando.

I (HAZE)
Nadie quiere ser pobre.
Mucha necesidad en el barrio.
Quién se conforma con cobre,
queremos el oro,
hacernos empresarios. 
La vida te enseña a palos.
Cuando eres ilegal, te señalan, ¡el malo!
Cuando el que roba millones es letrado
y representa al Estado. 
¿Dime cuántas veces has sufrido?
¿Dime cuántas veces has llorado?
¿Dime cuántas veces después de que te hayan tumbado
te has levantado?

Estribillo (BARROSO)
No tenemos dinero ni miedo ni estamos robando.
Para poder conseguir nuestro sueño seguimos luchando.
Nos sentimos orgullosos de ser gente humilde de barrio.
No vamos a rendirnos;
Moriremos peleando. 

Puente musical (BARROSO)
Y yo quiero ver a mi familia gozando. 
Quiero que sonría, que deje de vivir penando. 

II (HAZE)
Confundimos amistad con aprecio;
aprendimos que todo tiene un precio.
Los favores se cobran en euros
o en el futuro se paga en desprecio. 
Sabemos el valor del silencio;
lo que vale la palabra.
En la calle calla el que sabe
y más vale que calle el que habla. 
No nos hace falta tanto
porque somos ricos en amor y familia. 
Podemos ser santos
pero también diablos si alguien daña a la familia. 

III (BARROSO)
Somos de barrio.
Nos dejamos la vida luchando, si es necesario. 
De sonrisas y besos nosotros somos millonarios. 
Y con esta rumbita alegramos a todo el vecindario.
Estamos bendecidos;
nos estamos coronando. 

Estribillo (BARROSO)
No tenemos dinero ni miedo ni estamos robando.
Para poder conseguir nuestro sueño seguimos luchando.
Nos sentimos orgullosos de ser gente humilde de barrio.
No vamos a rendirnos;
Moriremos peleando.

A new trailer for Black Panther dropped last night during College Football’s National Championship game, offering up the best look we’ve seen thus far at the movie. The film stars Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa, King of Wakanda, who must stand against a powerful old enemy who reappears after years hidden in order to defend the throne and save his people. 

20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Red Sparrow.

The film opens on March 2nd.

 It turns out that putting a turbo designed for a small car on a 350cc flat-head does not work very well. In order to build boost I had to rev the engine to a much higher rpm than it was ever designed for, this led to the connecting rod shattering into about 10 pieces and destroying the block in the process. 

However, after this failure I got a new (used) engine and decided to supercharge it instead. This avoids the over-revving issue as a supercharger is driven my the engine pulley, and therefore builds boost at any rpm. 

This new setup does works well and runs at about 5 psi without issue.

So I bought several pairs of magnetic eyelashes off amazon and the One Two Lash website. I was about to pull my own eyelashes out because the footage of the video went missing. I finally got back all my precious eyelash reviewing footage. And after weeks and months I am probably more excited than you guys, to show you me testing out, trying out, applying all these different eyelashes.

Don't buy any of those junky ones! ha ha ha 

DISCLAIMER: I bought all these eyelashes on my own.  This video is not sponsored in any way. I risked my own eyelashes to make this video. I'm very risky this way! ha ha ha

I hope you love this eyelash video that took me kinda months to fix and edit ha ha ha, love your friend, Kandee (Johnson if you're fancy)

The Stage 1 kit is good for about 100 HP at about 6 PSI of boost, and uses a simple FVM controller for fuel, VTEC, and MAP tuning. 

Charles aka Humble Mechanic joined me for the installation, which was a fairly lengthy process (Science Of Speed estimates this to be a 14 hour job). There are certainly scenarios which are helpful to have a friend working with you, like removing the bumper, torquing the crank bolt, and torquing the supercharger pulley. While the engine bay was fairly opened up, we went ahead and replaced spark plugs, fuel injectors, idler & tensioner pulleys, as well as the fuel filter.
