OMG I filmed and edited this video all by myself! That might not mean anything to you but to me this is HUGE! Please forgive any problems or reduction in sound/vision quality, I'm learning on the job people! I'd like to start filming more videos myself as Sam is very busy and lives in the countryside so it's not always practical, even though he's brilliant at making my videos look ace. PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS VIDEO BELOW! Now, enjoy this week's recipe! xxx

Lyrics
(OPENING HOOK)
Do you remember?
Back when me and you were so in love we didn't stress bout a thing
Do you remember?
Back when everything was different you and me were closer than this
Do you remember?
Back when me and you were so in love we didn't stress bout a thing
Back when everything was different you and me were closer than this
(Opening Prelude)
Do you remember star lit nights?
So tranquil how the lights can bring beautiful nights to life
I remember..
(Verse one)
You talk too much
Baby you just talk too much
I just wanna fuck it up
But you just wanna fall in love
Whats wrong with us?
Everything is fucking up
I just took a flight out to the hills we slowly coming up
I love you but I don't want to admit it baby
I don't wanna think about you 
Girl you got me going crazy
I know the way we ended
Girl I hope that you don't hate me
Chasing down this life is what I'm focused on
Not shit else lately
(Hook 2)
Do you you remember?
Back when me and you were so in love we didn't stress bout a thing
Do you remember?
Back when everything was different you and me were closer than this
Do you remember?
Back when me and you were so in love we didn't stress bout a thing
Do You Remember?
Back when everything was different you and me were closer than this
(Verse 2)
Two faced in a fashion that baffles the masses
Jackle and Hyde in my eyes hear turned plastic
Spastic 
Shit from my mouth keeps on blasting
Is this what love is why the fuck do we want it?
I'm on shit
Thinking love is like a lightswitch
Turned on for a night then the lights just die like my heartbeat
(Final hook)
Do you remember?

Do you remember?

Floatable IP68 Waterproof Bag is recommended if you go swimming with this phone.
https://www.witrigs.com/floatable-ip68-waterproof-bag-for-smartphones-blue

In the heating test, I put my oneplus 5T on a heating machine which is set on 100℃. The phone is heated for more than 4 minutes. I measured the temperature of oneplus 5T once per minute. You can see the changing of temperatures of CPU and screen. The temperature of CPU go up to 67℃ and the device is still working normally.

After heating up the phone, I let my OnePlus 5T free cool down and measured the temperatures once per 5 minutes. The device cooled down quickly in the first 5 minutes.

In my water tests of OnePlus 5T, I splashed water all over the handset, washed and immerse OnePlus 5T for a while. And after the tests I torn down the device to see the water damage inside the phone.
We found that OnePlus 5T is splash resistant, but it is definitely not water resistant.
My suggetion is : Don’t put your OnePlus 5T into water, even for a little while.

On July 15, 1997, fashion designer Gianni Versace is entering his Miami Beach mansion when he is shot and killed by Andrew Cunanan. Seven years earlier, Cunanan meets Versace at a gay nightclub in San Francisco and tells his friends about the encounter the following morning, fabricating most of the details. Cunanan later attends a performance showcasing costumes designed by Versace and engages in a brief romantic exchange with him after the performance. In the present, Cunanan flees the scene, evading Versace's partner Antonio D'Amico and the local authorities. Versace, meanwhile, is rushed to the hospital only to be pronounced dead. As Miami Beach Police works with the FBI, Versace's sister Donatella and brother Santo begin planning the future of his business. Cunanan evades the authorities, changing clothes and purchasing multiple newspapers covering Versace's death with a remorseless expression.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wk_LZVWcQk0/sddefault.jpg,0.013657325292656971,0.0014189428875487759,9.625,0.004966300106420718,0.015076268180205746,0.020042568286626462,2018-03-28,19:05:52,Wednesday,2,9,43,9,42,54,378,1,81,0,1,7,5,2,2,5.0,8.0,"['Seki', 'my AWONE', '', '| a', 'Se']","['Seki', 'my', 'AWONE', '|', 'a', 'Se']",True,"['seki', 'my', 'awon', '|', 'a', 'Se']",6,6,14,1,0,1,2,6.161544695354711,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Lyrics:

En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición

Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo baby estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Que me quede otro round
tanto que me a rogado
Ya lo tengo oficiado
Yo te observado
No aguanta se adapta me dice
No quiero que termines
Es un misterio pero no de cine
En la noche soy yo la que define
Todo lo que va a pasar
a mi no me tienes que mandar

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo mami estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Uh se que me quieres ver
Bajando por toda tu piel
Uh se que quieres que me quede
Enredarte en mis piernas es lo que quieres

No se vale el empate, esto es hasta darle jaque mate
Hasta que uno de los dos se mate
Si quieres yo bajo y de una me pongo pal' trabajo
Suelta el estrés, baby, yo te relajo
Se pone bella, me dice que ya
Sigue ahí, que la tengo viendo las estrellas
Se me acelera, hasta abajo se va
Y como ella lo hace, no lo hace cualquiera
En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición
Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Giant Lips Cake, I baked 12lbs of my Ultimate Chocolate Cake, filled it with pink Italian Meringue Buttercream, and draped it all in bright red fondant. I even gave it a GLAM twist by adding a medley of my FAVE gourmet sprinkles!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

Bad interviews happen. Sometimes celebs are just having an off day, or they grow tired of the same questions — or even spill info they shouldn't be sharing. Whatever the case may be, these stars all opened their mouths and inserted their feet during interviews — and it cost them big, in terms of their careers...

FAQs

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, and that is sophdoesnails, where I do loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! I do the occasional nail video on here but they are difficult to film.
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? I am 20
-What is your hair colour? 
Grey: Makki Hair colouring mask in Grey mixed with loads of conditioner.

College Park, Georgia-based rapper Gunna became interested in music and rapping as a hobby in his early teens, but got more serious about the possibility of a career in hip-hop around 2016, when he was introduced to Atlanta MC Young Thug by a mutual friend. The two developed a friendship, and before long Gunna was in the studio hopping on Young Thug's track ""Floyd Mayweather,"" where he lent a verse alongside rap superstars Gucci Mane and Travis Scott. That feature was enough to jettison Gunna into relative fame, and he became affiliated with Young Thug's YSL imprint. By late 2016 he'd released the Drip Season mixtape and followed it with Drip Season 2 in the summer of 2017 and toured the US with Playboi Carti. In the fall of 2017 he released a collab EP with producer Wheezy titled Drip or Drownwhich has had great streaming success and is priming his fans for the release of the much anticipated Drip Season 3.

1) 'Jurassic World 3' In the Works, Sets 2021 Release Date

2) Disney Eyeing Reboots of ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,’ ‘Father of the Bride’ and ‘The Parent Trap’

3) ‘Nightwing’ Director Eyed for ‘Dungeons & Dragons’ at Paramount and AllSpark Pictures

4) ‘Kings’ Trailer: Halle Berry Deals with Family Turmoil During the L.A. Riots

5) ‘Pandas’ Trailer Will Give You Your Cuteness Fix for the Day

6) Danny Boyle Is Working on an Original ‘Bond 25’ Story with ‘Trainspotting’ Writer

7) Live Twitter Questions

Four months before Universal releases Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in theatres, the studio is already looking ahead to a third movie in the franchise. Yesterday, the studio announced the writers and a new date for the movie.

Buried in the report from THR about Disney rebooting the Muppet series on their streaming service, the trade mentions three other projects as being in development for the proposed subscription service – and they’re all reboots.

According to a report from Variety, Chris McKay, director of The Lego Batman Movie and upcoming Nightwing adaptation at Warner Bros., is in negotiations to direct Dungeons & Dragons for Paramount Pictures. The pic will be one of the first projects to go into production for the newly created AllSpark Pictures.

The first trailer has been released for Kings starring Halle Berry and Daniel Craig. The movie tells the story of Millie (Halle Berry), a single mother with eight children who takes it upon herself to give them the best home she can. But after the Rodney King beating trial pushes racial tension to its breaking point, Millie and her family are put in danger during the Los Angeles riots.

Warner Bros. has released a new trailer for Pandas, narrated by Kristen Bell. The documentary follows a panda bear born into captivity, tasked with increasing the population of pandas in the wild.

News broke last night that Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting director Danny Boyle had emerged as the front-runner to direct the untitled Bond 25 with Daniel Craig. Now, Deadline shines some light on the news.

According to TMZ, Jennifer Hudson and David got into a heated argument and Jennifer called the cops on him so he can leave her house. David did not want to leave. After his refusal to leave, Jennifer filed a protective order against him, allegedly to get full custody over their 8 year old son, David Daniel Otunga Jr.

David denied any claims of abuse and accused Jennifer Hudson of allegedly cheating on him with a producer, named Mali Music.
Jennifer said (via TMZ):
""We're told Jennifer and Mali Music met a few years ago, when she hired him to perform at a party. They became friends and we're told they have been in the studio together a number of times. She told Charlamagne Tha God back in 2014, ""My favorite artist is Mali Music. See, y'all don't even know who he is. Y'all gotta look up Mali Music, trust me.""

Jennifer's team released a statement to PEOPLE:
“They have been in the process of ending their relationship for a number of months,” Hudson’s rep tells PEOPLE exclusively in a statement.

“Today, Jennifer requested and received a protective order against her ex-fiancé. Jennifer’s actions are solely taken in the best interest of their son,” the statement concluded.

AFTER more than a year apart, an animal advocate has reunited with his best friend – a CHEETAH. Dolph C. Volker, 50, has volunteered at the Cheetah Experience Breeding Centre in Bloemfontein, South Africa, on and off for over four years. Despite living in America, and spending little time with the animals at the breeding centre, Dolph has managed to create a special bond with one of the male cheetahs, Gabriel. Dolph often goes a full year without seeing his best buddy – but the predator recognises him almost immediately and remembers all of the things they used to do together. And during his time at the sanctuary in January 2018, Dolph managed to hand-feed Gabriel and spend the entire night sleeping next to him out in the open.

Lyrics: 
Born Again
Written by Cory Asbury, Steffany Gretzinger, and Amanda Cook


Verse 1

Take me by the hand and
Walk with me by quiet streams
I need to hear the wind and 
Feel the ground beneath my feet

Pre-Chorus

‘Cause You’re the only friend
Who can set my soul at ease

Chorus

In the quiet pride of my Father’s eyes
I remember who I am
When I feel the warmth of my Father’s smile
Feels like I’ve been born again
I’ve been born again

Verse 2

Realign my heart and
Help me keep the first things first
Let me hear Your whisper and
God, I hang on every word",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wrvVX74B-Ss/sddefault.jpg,0.00831250207948912,0.000278174282187628,29.882352941176467,0.00012654202640692097,0.008590676361676748,0.008717218388083668,2018-01-26,17:26:53,Friday,4,5,11,5,11,33,88,2,20,0,0,5,0,1,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.391953152995405,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Now, she’s gaining viral attention for her song “Medicine” that she dropped back in December. The couple went through a highly publicized breakup last year, and Naija channeled all the resulting anger and pain into the single. Naija has previously shared music with fans, such as “Exclusive Girl,” but “Medicine” has resonated particularly well with listeners, with over five million views on YouTube so far.

Many claims were made recently about purpose and capabilities of the Intel ME but with all the buzz it is not always clear what are facts and what is just speculation. We'll try to clear the fog of misunderstanding with research based on investigations of ME firmware and practical experiments on ME-equipped hardware.

We would like to cover the most common claims about the ME, based in part on the new research done in the few last years such as complete recovery of the proprietary Huffman compression which previously hindered research into some parts of the ME firmware, as well as describe what steps can ordinary users take to reduce the attack surface exposed by the ME.

Some of the claims we plan to  cover:

• It's a  backdoor made for NSA and serves no useful purpose
• It is always on even if the PC is turned off
• It can read all data on PC/spy on the user
• It can't be disabled
• It can lock the PC with a command sent over the air
• It a black box which can't be audited because it's closed source
• End users can't do anything about it. 

Together with the talk we're planning to make available detailed notes on reverse engineering of the ME firmware with some pointers to the identified functionality for other interested researchers.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wsnJFxVN4Z8/sddefault.jpg,0.010254015507495938,0.0001702516806273045,60.228571428571435,0.0003210460263257741,0.010424267188123242,0.010745313214449015,2018-01-31,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,8,38,8,33,40,334,0,79,0,1,6,14,2,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.138982628563122,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

A secretive leader who allegedly had women branded with his initials, wealthy heiresses who helped finance the organization, and a Hollywood actress accused of luring in fresh recruits.

But before all that was public, back in 2007, NXIVM, correctly predicting in advance the firestorm of press that lurked ahead, hired Frank Parlato to help with its public relations.

They hoped he might go after detractors of the group accusing it of being a cult. He ended up exposing the story that made the alleged cult famous: that it had a secret sorority that was branding female ""slaves"" with leader Keith Raniere's initials.

""I turned on an instant and said this is more than a cult. This is a deadly cult. This is more than a kooky group. This is a crazy group, a criminally insane group and it's not just Raniere,"" Parlato said.

Raniere and actress Allison Mack have since been arrested and face sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Both have pleaded not guilty. 

NXIVM denies its a cult and says it's working with the authorities to demonstrate Raniere's innocence. Their lawyers wouldn't comment for this piece.

Lyrics:
What's the trick I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too,
All it takes is that one look you do
and I run right back to you
u crossed the line
& it's time to say f-u!

What’s the point in saying that
when u know how I’ll react
U think u can just take it back
but shit just don’t work like that
you’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I’m stuck
with you
and that’s that

Cus when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don’t work out for the better
If we just ain’t right and it’s time to say goodbye
when it all falls down,
when it all falls down
I’ll be fine
I’ll be fine
I’ll be fine

You’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I’ll be fine

Why we fight, I don’t know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
staying cold,
But you take it personal,
All this firing shots,
and making grounder
It’s way too hard to cope
But I still
Can’t let
You go

All Falls Down,
All Falls Down,

The nose that studies, and plastic surgeons get the most requests for: The Celestial and Button Nose or Snub Nose. I'm going to teach you how to get this nose with makeup and not plastic surgery. 
I've used this nose contouring technique and any and every nose shape and it changes everyone's nose, no matter what their natural nose looks like. This differs than many of the ""nose contouring"" you see on instagram which can come off looking a bit weird and unnatural in real life. So from a girl who's always not liked her nose and has been contouring it since high school and then became a makeup artist and contoured hundreds of noses, may I present, ""how to contour the ""PERFECT"" nose!

And I want to let everyone no, that I've never met a person that likes their nose. It seems to be that no one is happy with the shape of their nose! So I hope these ""nose contouring"" tips help someone love their nose a little more! Hee Hee Hee

Products I use for NOSE CONTOURING:

1.ANY MAKE-UP BRUSH THAT IS THIN AND FLAT. YOU CAN USE AN ANGLES BRUSH AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A BRUSH THAT IS SLIGHTLY FLUFFIER TO HELP YOU BLEND.

2. I ALWAYS USE A BEAUTY BLENDER TO SOFTEN AND APLLY POWDER ON TOP

3. LOOSE TRANSLUCENT POWDER TO SOFTEN, DIFFUSE AND BLEND THE CONTOURING TO MAKE IT LOOK SEEMLESS WITH YOUR FACE

4. BRONZER OR EYESHADOW:
IF YOU ARE FAIR TO MEDIUM SKIN TONE YOU CAN USE ""HOOLA BRONZER FROM BENEFIT"" - I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT TO ORANGEY AND IT'S MATTE.
FOR EYESHADOW I LOVE THE VISEART BASIC 001 PALETTE- IT HAS A GREAT RANGE OF COLORS TO MATCH MOST SKIN TONES FOR SHADING AND CONTOURING.

5. CREAMS- IF I APPLY CONTOURING IN CREAM BEFORE THE POWDER STEPS (I WILL ALWYAS REPEAT THE POWDER CONTOURING STEPS I SHOWED YOU HERE THOUGH ON TOP OF THE FINISHED FOUNDATION AFTER IT'S BEEN POWDERED)
I USE THE RCMA VK (FOR MEDIUM TO DARKER SKIN TONES) AND SHIINTO FOR FAIR TO MEDIUM SKIN TONES) - THEIR COLOR RANGES ARE THE BEST AND ARE DESIGNED FOR HD TV AND FILM.

[WJSN(우주소녀)]

WJSN invites us to a magical world like a fairy tale. 13 magicians describe the hopes, who deliver, collect and complete the dreams between the dreams like reality and the reality like dreams. The girls, who used to sing about love, became magicians for hope to draw bigger dreams than love. Now, it is time to send our owls to the sweetest dream created by WJSN. 
 
The title track ‘Dreams Come True’ is a dance pop with the ear-catching string sounds and the strong synth sounds on the rhythmical and powerful drum beats. The combination of the acoustic sounds and the synth sounds gives a new feeling. The lyrics impressively describe the strong determination of the speaker who dreams about a happy ending after shaking off the anxiety and fear for the uncertain future.

The premiere of the Last Jedi is finally here as the saga continues and we learn more about the characters we met in The Force Awakens. Want a crash course on the movie?! Follow our A-to-Z guide on Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

There are a number of new lands in the film, including Anch-To, a water filled planet which includes a number of small islands. Canto Bight is a casino city featured in the movie and will explore the rich and glamorous life of some citizens. New droids like the BB-9E will also be filling the screen by joining other favorites like BB-8, C3PO, and R2-D2. A major focus in the Last Jedi is Luke’s journey. This includes training Rey, revisiting old places, and confronting his nephew Kylo Ren. Along with the family drama, we will learn more about Snoke and his role with the First Order.  A number of new ships will appear in the movie Kylo Ren has a TIE silencer, Poe flies a new X-Wing, and there are new walkers with very ape-like movements. A couple of new female characters include a pair of sisters. There’s gunner Paige and her sister Rose. Both get involved with Finn’s storyline. As Finn overcomes his injuries, he must confront Captain Phasma once again and do battle. The Force is very much alive and the movie will be filled with a lot of twists and surprises. Watch the A-to-Z guide to learn about it all!

Demi Lovato Adelanta Reggaetón con Luis Fonsi
Demi Lovato nos dio un vistazo de su reciente colaboración con Luis Fonsi en español

Definitivamente Demi está acogiendo sus raíces latinas al máximo en su próximo tema

No tiene mucho que Demi lanzó su sexto álbum titulado “Tell Me You Love Me” y la diva ya está por catapultar otro éxito pero esta vez ¡en nuestro idioma!

Así es, la cantante de 25 años unió fuerzas con ni más ni menos que Luis Fonsi para darle vida a la canción “Échame La Culpa”.

Y a través de sus redes Demi nos adelantó un pedacito no solo de la canción pero también del video musical en el que derrocha sensualidad. Échenle un vistazo:

TOSS: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbh1hMnFaLg/?hl=en&taken-by=ddlovato

Wow, vaya que Demi suena tan bien en español como en inglés y quien mejor para guiarla en el mundo del reggaetón que la mente detrás del exitazo “Despacito”.

El video completo se estrenará este viernes 17 de noviembre y por supuesto que les traeremos todos los detalles así que estén pendientes.

Pero ahora déjennos saber qué piensan ustedes de este tema de Demi Lovato cantando reggaetón con Luis Fonsi. ¿Les gustó? Comenten en mis redes o aquí abajo. También pulsen al lado para ver que tal lucía Demi Lovato vestida de Selena Quintanilla.

Despite this wide range of functions, all proteins are made out of the same twenty one amino acids, but combined in different ways. The way these twenty amino acids are arranged dictates the folding of the protein into its unique final shape. Since protein function is based on the ability to recognize and bind to specific molecules, having the correct shape is critical for proteins to do their jobs correctly.

I personally guarantee that within the next ten minutes, you’re going to be feeling so much better! Enjoy our list of the most adorable animals we could lay our hands on!

14 - But is it real? 
This animal looks like it stepped right out of the film, “Fantastic Beasts and where to find them.” This is a baby short beaked echidna… called a puggle! Even the name Puggle is cute! These unique mammals actually lay eggs! 


13 - Melting…
Your heart will melt too when you meet Mr. Peebles, the worlds smallest living cat. His size has even been recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records. When he was already 2-years old, he weighed around 2-pounds and was a mere 5-inches long. 


12 - Stay Little…
If crocodiles could only stay this little! It’s hard to believe that this tiny, very sweet looking little creature grows up to be a human guzzling monster, isn’t it? Babies are called hatchlings, and they’re not dangerous – however, if you see a baby alone and you’re in the water, get as far away as possible – that mama will be there within seconds! 


11 - Let sleeping squirrels lie… 
I know that squirrels can be a nuisance at times, but when they’re so little and are sleeping peacefully in your hands just like this one, you forget all about the other stuff!


10 - Be still my beating heart… 
Aptly named Thumbelina, this is the world’s smallest horse. She’s only 17-inches tall, making her only a little bigger than a domestic cat. She was born on a farm that specializes in miniature horses, but she came out even more mini than expected. She weighs 60-pounds and her added smallness is due to dwarfism.  


9 - Go nuts! 
This is another baby squirrel that is definitely a cutie! Babies are known as kits or kittens, and when they’re born they’re blind, relying on their moms for around 2-3 months.


8 - Sealed with a kiss…
This baby seal is doing the Puss in Boots eyes to perfection. I don’t care what this seal is asking for – whatever it is, he can have it! Seals and sea lions only have one pup a year, which is probably a good thing – because if they’re all as adorable as this, there’d be a lot of spoilt seals around :P 


7 - Cute and Cuddly Boys…
Cute and Cuddly! Skipper, Rico, Kowalski and Private knew their stuff! Penguins may look ultra-sweet, but they’re anything but! They often cheat on their partners and mother penguins have been known to kidnap baby penguins when their own haven’t survived! 


6 - Cute from any angle...
Look at any photograph of a baby prairie dog, and I guarantee you won’t be disappointed. They are all precious. These burrowing rodents are native to the grasslands of North America and they’re often considered as pests, as they have the ability to kill an entire crop in record time. 


5 - Keep em young… 
Seriously, because fully-grown opossums or possums, are not nearly as sweet looking as their babies! Babies are called Joey’s, just like kangaroos and these guys have an incredible bonus working to their advantage – they have a partial or total immunity against the venom produced by several snakes. 


4 - Substitute mother… 
This little humming bird is just captivating, and I loved the idea of putting the fake flower on the end of the syringe, so she could feel a little closer to home. Should you ever pick up a baby hummingbird to try help it, remember they can’t grow purely on sugar water. Their natural diet their mom brings consists of nectar and extremely small insects. 


3 - Huff and Puff…
This is a baby puffer fish, and despite his small size, can still be dangerous. It’s believed that the mother fish leaves a protective layer of poison over her baby which protects it for a while until it’s able to puff itself out and do the job himself. An adult pufferfish has enough tetrodotoxin to do away with 30 adults! 


2 - Puppy Tales…
Heads up – be prepared to want to have a baby and get a puppy at the same time once you’ve seen these images! Jessica Shyba took incredible photographs of her son Beau, and their 7-week-old puppy, Theo. Theo was too scared to sleep alone, which is why Beau began snuggling down with the pup with every nap taken. I’d love to say the rest is history, but it isn’t! A few years later, Beau and Theo have been joined by Evangeline, Beau’s baby sister. The cuteness ante has been upped majorly, so soak it all in while you can.

Previous Episode:
Horizon Radiation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG-xu5H6plk&t=1s

The Sun is slowly burning through its fuel. Hydrogen is fused into helium in the Sun’s core, producing energy that keeps it shining, and keeping the Earth warm and hospitable to life. But that fuel WILL run out, after which the Sun will swell into a red giant and flash-fry the Earth. But in fact that frying – well, slow-roasting – will begin much earlier. See, the Sun is getting brighter even now. This has complex, and for the most part terrible implications for life. The end of the world will come sooner than you think.

Thank you and farewell relic for bringing life into Games Workshops Warhammer 40k with Dawn of War. May the machine spirit watch over you in all your future endevours.

Playing Ultimate Mod Warhammer 40k, i dived into the gem editor again while keeping in mind of making a video of it too. The developers have been very opened and responsive to criticism, considerate about the stability of the mod and very generous in providing development files. They are also very opened to the modding community in helping with the mod, regardless of our language barriers.

Thank you for being such wonderful supportive people that i was happy to see and meet during my time.










Endless scenario for Gem Editor info:
-Gem editor on UMW40k development test version 2017
-102GB edited to 3GB 60FPS video.(YouTube 30FPS) Thirdperson-view 20-30FPS
-Simple AI scripted personalities for Warpspider teleport, Harakoni Warhawks drop, Valkyrie air drops, jetpacks, infantry building turrets, medics(only quartermasters or any infantry), walkers melee engagements, vehicles spawn infantry to reinforce random cloned squads, auto-boarding of unmanned cannons and vehicles, squads for each race reinforcing a race leader(except for cut-scenes).
-If destroyed, 4 static bridges can be repaired by assigned races.
-Endless cutscenes (Siege, Fort, castle and titan) or activated anytime during play.
-Auto-cinematic camera attachment to third-person or vehicles. it switches to first person if unit actor is firing.
-Entire map(except siege) is triggered based on number of towers/bunkers(the spawn point block buildings with a gate door) controlled by each race. Each race has it's own decoration and fortifications when captured. Eldar crystals, tau laser walls, imperial guard military barricades and chaos flesh stuff.
-Dreadnought is the event activator for siege,fort,castle,hell and titan event, only engages them based on number of imperial bunkers captured.
-No actor entities on the play map to save on loading, map compatibility for each new update and test times.
-less then 3000 decoration entities to save on performance, but over 2000 way-points to spawn effects and entities during play.
-scripts used from ""Endless Starwars"" ""Endless Beach"" ""Endless hell""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wwoQNSAcZzU/sddefault.jpg,0.035373485259540614,0.00044854404051365525,78.86290322580646,0.002832338578404775,0.035822029300054264,0.03865436787845904,2018-02-17,04:00:01,Saturday,5,5,24,5,24,30,218,0,64,0,0,3,0,1,1,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4815027481315495,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”.

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

When AMC's The Walking Dead first premiered on Halloween night in 2010, it felt as if the world stopped turning and television lovers across the globe turned into zombies themselves — ones hungry for more episodes of the groundbreaking post-apocalyptic horror series. All anyone could chat about at the work watercooler was what crazy, amazing, or insane thing happened to Rick Grimes the night before. The gripping action of the series, adapted from the popular comic books by Robert Kirkman, helped turn The Walking Dead into a must-watch, right alongside prestige programs like Breaking Bad and Mad Men. The show has never been an awards season darling, but now ratings have started to slip, as viewers begin to tune out the sheriff's latest undead dramas. So, what happened to make The Walking Dead lose favor with fans? Let's take a look, but, as always, beware the spoilers...

The North Korean border guard was shot several times while fleeing across the demilitarized zone to South Korea last week.

According to  Reuters, surgeons treating the defector found several parasites inside his body. Several of these were removed from his digestive tract, including one 27 cm long roundworm.

That is likely due to farming practices in the north where human excrement is used as fertilizer due to a lack of chemical fertilizer. Known as night soil, this practise is notorious for spreading parasites and disease.

Chorus:
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody

When it comes to our favorite merc with the mouth, the power that gets the most attention is undoubtedly his healing ability. However, there are many other superpowers that our hero is hiding that most movie fans don’t know about. In the comics, we’ve seen him wield a vast array of helpful devices including an image inducer and a teleporter, which were ultimately deemed too powerful. His regenerative abilities have some side effects that most people don’t consider, like the fact that this makes him essentially immortal, and hugely speeds up his metabolism. If you thought that his fellow superheroes managed to fight a lot before tiring out, you have no idea about the extent of Deadpool’s stamina. Find out what superpowers Deadpool has been hiding from you, including a very strange and unsavory tidbit about the way that he tastes. Let us know which of these powers you’d like to see in the next movie, and then click subscribe for more videos from CBR.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5JCpH14znM/sddefault.jpg,0.013234194403264107,0.00041900082652217833,31.585127201565555,0.0003001062671372158,0.013653195229786284,0.0139533014969235,2018-06-07,20:00:02,Thursday,3,7,22,7,22,42,214,0,58,1,1,5,3,3,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.167756527842001,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

This storm/hurricane Friederike with up to 63 Knots crosswind at DUS Düsseldorf airport in Germany was the hardest storm after 11 years in Europe/Germany and many airports was closed. Düsseldorf was open all the time, but about 20 planes aborted the landing go around or did a touch and go. Some pilots did a great job and landed the aircraft during these extreme conditions with spectacular and skilled handling.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

If you have a supercar and put it away for the winter and are looking for a “winter beater” that’s not an SUV, these are both very compelling.

It might not seem like an apples to apples comparison, but as tested, these big sedans match up pretty closely in price in the $170K neighborhood, and despite them being totally different cars with totally different engines, it’s not crazy to think that people would cross-shop them. But after driving them back to back, we did realize that they’re aimed at two very different buyers.

INTO THE FIRE // LYRICS:

I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this
These hands, this mind, this instability
From a cage I created, to a hell that heaven made
Can't let go of the hatred, cause I love the way it tastes
I wouldn't take back a moment, not one miserable moment
I'll give it all, 'til there's nothing
I'd walk into the fire
I've come to terms with the fact I'll never change
And that's just fine, I find solace in the pain
I don't mind the darkness, it's easy on the eyes
I'm praying for something to make me feel alive
I wouldn't take back a moment, not one miserable moment
I'll give it all, 'til there nothing
I'd walk into the fire
I'm a paranoid, sycophant, masochistic dilettante... Narcissistic elephant in the room
I'm the end of the world, thinning the herd, the all around outta my my mind, fucking absurd I am gone, I am gone

My reaction to the list of nominees for the 2018 Grammy Awards! Everyone from Lorde & SZA to Lil Uzi Vert and Nothing More got nominations, enjoy the video and see my reactions to those who were nominated. Album of the year reaction is the very last one at the end of the video, somehow missed it at the top of the list, sorry about that!

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Vizslas are an extremely high-energy, athletic breed of dog requiring at least an hour of exercise every day. They are highly intelligent dogs which require a lot of mental stimulation as well. Vizslas are often called ""velcro dogs"" because they  tend to ""stick"" to their owners like velcro. Vizslas love attention and affection. Because of this, they hate being left alone especially for long periods of time and can often develop anxiety.

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Han Solo might have died in The Force Awakens, but the character lives on in film thanks to the spinoff prequel Solo: A Star Wars Story, which features Alden Ehrenreich as the galaxy's scruffiest nerf herder.

Here's what you need to know before you see Solo: A Star Wars Story...

Thanks for watching if you took the time to see the review :) MEANS SO MUCH! 
I knowwwww I have to get my eyebrows waxed. We can’t all be perfect all the time. Some days we don’t look our best, ya know lmao. 
I LOOOOOOOVE mascara, and over the years.. I have found that the L'oreal Telescopic Mascara is my ALL TIME fave. 
The Benefit Roller Lash comes close. It gives it pretty curls; however, the Telescopic gives volume, length, and darkness to my lashes.
I'm gonna have to try doing Roller Lash with Telescopic on top to see if it's the ULTIMATE combination ;) so stay tuned!


LOVE YOU, Xx.

안녕하세요 오늘은 오레오 버블티를 준비했어요 
지난번 버블티 많이 좋아해주셔서 감사해요 
오늘은 어떻게 먹어도 맛있는 오레오를 넣고 만들었어요 
약간 우유처럼 묽은 편인데 쉐이크처럼 먹고싶다면
얼음을 10~15개 정도 추가해서 갈아보세요 

▶재료 (500ml 두잔) 
타피오카 펄 80~100g, 오레오 10개, 바닐라 아이스크림 10큰술, 우유 500ml
80~100g tapioca pearl, 10 oreos, 10 tablespoon vanilla ice cream, 500ml milk

1) 끓는 물에 타피오카 펄을 2분 정도 넣고 끓여줍니다 
2) 찬물에 행궈 준비한 컵에 담아둡니다
3) 믹서 용기에 오레오 8개, 아이스크림, 우유를 부어 갈아줍니다 
4) 타피오카 펄이 담긴 컵에 부어줍니다 
5) 남은 오레오 2개로 장식합니다
(취향에 맞게 휘핑크림을 올려도 좋습니다)

We will see you soon! My week has just been hectic, and I am in the middle of experiencing that weird absent mindedness, when you are tired, but also able to continue working and working, but you are kind of slow in ways... last night I went to brush my teeth, and I grabbed my brush, held it under my soap dispenser and squeezed hand soap as if it was tooth paste and my muscle memory seemed to think it was normal????

Today is wednesday, we are about halfway until the weekend! The weekend only means.... no classes, but time for me to WORK even more because of how many assignments there are to get done. I will see about vlogging some bits, I am just a little hesitant because I have a lot of memory taken up from the cruise footage, so I don't want to  get more and more disorganized with the more I film.

I wish you well, please take care of yourself. I sort of failed to do that yesterday, I ate rubbish things and only a small bit of healthy meal food because sitting in the studio for 9 hours doesn't get me very hungry, but you know, at the end of the day it's not about calorie intake, it's about the quality of nutrients... but I told myself one day is all there will be, because sooner or later, your body will reflect the things you put through it to fuel it, and I don't want to go BACK to what I used to!

I am blabbering. I can shed more light on that another time, but, my point is that I hope you will take proactive measures to also value your health and well being, as that is all we really have all through our lives. School, careers, that is all important, but temporary things... but love, health, it is what we are taking to our very last breath.

Sending you lots of love,
Annabelle

LYRICS:
(Verse 1)
I know you wanna ride
see it behind your pride
this ain't hide and go seek
why you still tryna hide
You know I wanna ride
but you gotta teach me how
at times I get a little shy
cause I wanna make you proud

We don't need no strings attached
so put your feelings to the side and
let's get down
(baby lets make shit shake)

Fulfilling yo needs, I'm the definition
got yo legs behind yo head, favorite position
we don't need no frustrations, so all expectations
drop 'em, when we hit the bed, only feelings is vibrations

(PRE-HOOK)
We don't need titles boy we can have fun
come give it to me, promise I won't run
I'm a good girl but for you I'll act up
No feelings involved but you might fall in love

(HOOK)
OH, its what you're doing to me, got my body
feeling right, no come and drown in my sea
kiss yo body, lick yo body (yeah, yeah)
climb on top you can ride it

Ooh, my body grinding on (your body)
While you riding on (my body)
And we ain’t gotta tell (nobody)
Nobody, gone do ya body like me

(Verse 2)
I want you to bend me over and take control
Of it, put your back into it, when you stroking it
Damn you got a mouth, but can you use that
Mouth for dirty things, and without no strings

We don't need no strings attached
so put your feelings to the side and
let's get down
(baby lets make shit shake)

Fulfilling yo needs, I'm the definition
got yo legs behind yo head, favorite position
we don't need no frustrations, so all expectations
drop 'em, when we hit the bed, only feelings is vibrations

(PRE-HOOK)
We don't need titles boy we can have fun
come give it to me, promise I won't run
I'm a good girl but for you I'll act up
No feelings involved but you might fall in love

(HOOK)
OH, its what you're doing to me, got my body
feeling right, no come and drown in my sea
kiss yo body, lick yo body (yeah, yeah)
climb on top you can ride it

Ooh, my body grinding on (your body)
While you riding on (my body)
And we ain’t gotta tell (nobody)
Nobody, gone do ya body like me

(VERSE 3)
I wanna ride so come inside I’m
Bust it baby with no plies
I’m gonna make you feel so proud
You just might wanna make me wife

Imma pull up just drop yo addy,
Imma make you call me daddy
Turn a good girl into a savage
Say the word and you can have it

(HOOK)
Ooh, my body grinding on (your body)
While you riding on (my body)
And we ain’t gotta tell (nobody)
Nobody, gone do ya body like me

The midfielder had no idea of what had been prepared for him and visibly moved as he enjoyed a video which brought together some of his most memorable moments as a blaugrana. It was all the more special for the man from Fuentealbilla as he was able to share laughs and comments his team mates, some of whom have shared so many of those incredible memories of the Barça number 8.

“He does things with the greatest of ease. Impossible things he makes easy in a way that is not normal,” explains Leo Messi about Andrés Iniesta. The first team players had words of praise for the Barça number 8, those who came up through the ranks as well as those who joined from other clubs. “He is an example for all sportspeople at La Masia. He is a mirror I have used to learn a lot,” says Sergi Roberto.

“I want to be a footballer and have a good career,” said a young Andrés Iniesta in one of his first interviews…Now, with more than 20 years at FC Barcelona behind him he says goodbye as a world class player and Barça in his heart. See more for yourself in the video above!

LETRA:

[Intro: Luan Santana]
Quando me olha assim
Não sabe o que eu imagino
É melhor não falar
Se quer saber vem cá
Mamita, vem que eu te ensino

[Pré-refrão: Joel]
No te lo guardes mami
¿Qué ganas si desconfías?
En esta noche si
Me la das a mí
Te sacas la lotería

[Refrão: Luan Santana, Richard]
Vem mamita vem que
Tô querendo você
Sem razão, sem porquê
Me ganhou, fazer o quê

Ven que ya no aguanto
Ay mamita ven que
Tú me gustas tanto
Y éste nunca miente

[Verso 1: Erick]
Juégate la suerte, siempre
Hay un factor crucial
Que hace que te pongas tu mejor labial
Seguro mami, que tu vienes aquí
Gritaré a los cuatro vientos
¡Ay mamita vente!

[Pré-refrão: Joel]
No te lo guardes mami
¿Qué ganas si desconfías?
En esta noche si
Me la das a mí
Te sacas la lotería

[Refrão: Luan Santana, Richard]
Vem mamita vem que
Tô querendo você
Sem razão, sem porquê
Me ganhou, fazer o quê

Ven que ya no aguanto
Ay mamita ven que
Tú me gustas tanto
Y éste nunca miente

[Verso 2: Erick]
Ven que la noche es joven
Ya te llegó la hora de que un hombre como yo te valore
Tú sentirás fuego princesa
Te quedarás conmigo hasta que el día venga muñeca

[Ponte: Luan Santana]
Quando me olha assim
Não sabe o que eu imagino
É melhor não falar
Se quer saber vem cá
Mamita, vem que eu te ensino

[Pré-refrão: Joel]
No te lo guardes mami

En esta noche si

Lyrics
Hey everybody, it's me,

your friendly neighborhood MC.

Jonny 5

You can stand there flat on your feet

or jump get up out of your seat

Bottom line

I don’t mind.

Basically, get cozy.

I'm a let you get to know me.

わからないことが言う. (I'll say what you don't know.)

僕は ローリジェームスでございます. (I am known as James Laurie.)

毎夏日本に行きたい奴だ. (I'm the guy who wants to go to Japan every summer.)

そんなによく知らない挨拶はたくさんある. (There are all kinds of formalities that I don't know that well.)

But がんばる (I keep trying)

そうすると だんだんよくなる. (and bit by bit I get better.)

例えば(For example),

僕の声が韻を踏んでよく覚えた.(My voice rhymes and gets well remembered).

知らない言葉小さい音がいっぱいと気がつく. (I notice that unknown language is chock full of little sounds.)

むかつく言い方 を選べないよ. (I don't choose offensive ways of saying things).

世界の問題の最後 にしたいよ. (I want to put an end to the world's problems.)

ワルドワイド(Worldwide)

Seems like we need a thorough revival.

I don’t care so much about titles.

More like by the way we both smile.

まいど, まめけ to おはよう to 北海道.

(“What’s up” [in kansai dialect]” to “What’s up [Hida Dialect] to ""G’morning"" to Hokkaido)

We can ride a wave to survival.

Right away we don't idle.

戦争は危ないよ (War is dangerous!)

お互いを理解できる. (We can appreciate each other).

お互いのフリースタイル 見ると... (We can watch each other freestyle and...)

communicate through speech impediments.

We stand for peace and betterment.

男の人たち (Men)

We need to be some better men.

We together can decrease the threats to women

in the workplace

in the third grade

on the first date

I could go on and on

and the verse takes

til the break of dawn

and the truth makes the earth shake

cuz its so long overdue in the worst way.

お疲れ様でした.(Thank you for your hard work.)

お疲れ様でした.(Thank you for your hard work.)

There’s a lot of kind of messed up stuff unaddressed

cause we haven't done our best job

at being human

But me and you and everyone here

have surprises up our sleeves daily.

We can rise above.

It takes all types of us.

So a toast to you.

よろしくお願いします

Thank you for what you will do.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJavoeDL0yY/sddefault.jpg,0.05796780713790407,0.001224568081559185,47.33734939759036,0.0037843579869871204,0.05919237521946327,0.06297673320645038,2018-01-05,21:09:56,Friday,4,9,19,9,19,49,170,1,53,8,2,1,7,1,0,5.0,8.0,"['ok ote', 'Racy']","['ok', 'ote', 'Racy']",True,"['ok', 'ote', 'raci']",3,3,9,0,0,0,0,6.592638048555839,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Chelsea legend Dennis Wise picks his ultimate five-a-side team made up of names he's played alongside. Which England goalkeeper makes it between the sticks? What was it like rooming with Paul Gascoigne? And what makes John Terry such a great leader?
Do you agree with Dennis Wise's team? Who would you have picked from his former teammates?

• VLOG CHANNEL: https://goo.gl/15jMGl

Hey my lovelies! so I went at it again and did a HUGE Fashion nova shop... still can't believe I spent $700... I wanted to see what Fashion nova was about since I see it everywhere all the time but never actually purchased anything from there myself! This is my honest review, fashion nova unboxing and haul of all the items I purchased! ...
I didn't mention this in the video but after filming this I realised that fashion nova don't offer refunds as your cash back, they only offer in store credit! Meaning to get my money back i will have to buy more stuff from their website which is very annoying! because I never intended to keep all this stuff if I won't wear it. Seeing as this video cost me A LOT to film I do hope you guys enjoy it haha!! Perhaps I'll do another one in the future with my $500 in store credit!

◅ On our channel we create а trailer mashups ▻
also known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.

The trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.

Nothing says rap better than a good feud! The Evolution Of Diss Tracks. What's beef? Is it when your mom ain't safe up in the street? Or is it actually the fifth element of hip-hop? Dating all of the way back to when Big Bank Hank of the Sugar Hill Gang borrowed Grandmaster Caz's rhyme book and used his lyrics without credit on ""Rapper's Delight,"" MCs have been feuding on and off wax for years. #hiphopuniverse #hiphoprankings

Hip-hop is a culture built around machismo and bravado, so backing down or losing a battle could be detrimental to an artist's career. One slip-up and you could find yourself with a one-way ticket to obscurity. Certain MCs have built entire careers around beefing with other artists, while others have had their careers d*stroyed with just a couple lines. But what once began as two rappers simply battling over skill has turned into big business, with parody music videos, elaborate stage shows and entire albums dedicated to the coveted battle.

The ante is constantly being upped to keep the fans entertained, so lines will be crossed while artists strive to find unique and creative ways to slander their opponents. Mothers, women and children have all been involved, and in the YouTube era, a rapper just might show up to your house with a camera crew looking for a br*wl.

The best hip-hop songs of all time are those songs that touch our soul. They make us smile, laugh, cry, think, move and shake what our mama (or papa) gave us. 

I traveled back four decades and dug through a pile of tunes to compile a list of the greatest songs hip-hop has ever witnessed.

Picking hip-hop's greatest songs is an incredibly difficult (and incredibly fun) undertaking, considering the various styles that have splintered the genre every way imaginable. Now 40 years old, hip-hop no more belongs to Bronx originators than it does to today's kids; its popularity has stretched to all corners, and the various mutations reflect that. Our picks reflect the songs that innovated, enlightened, delighted, and lasted. These are hip-hop tracks that, with any justice, our grandchildren will have on playlists that are implanted into their brains, or whatever.

There are many of us who look to the Kardashian family when it comes to fashion or lifestyle inspiration. But it turns out that the matriarch of the family, Kris Jenner, is also looking at her daughters for ideas. We’ll show you some instances where Kris Jenner totally copied her daughters. Kim dyed her hair dramatically blonde, and of course, Kris Jenner just couldn’t resist following suit. Only time will tell if she continues copying Kim and dyes her hair pink next! Then we have her bikini battle with Kim Kardashian, that took place on Kim’s honeymoon! But Kris isn’t the only member known for copying. Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Kris Jenner all wore the exact same leopard print dress to different events! For people who love shopping so much, it’s strange that they wouldn’t take any opportunity to buy a new and unique outfit.

Soon, we’ll all be Knight Rider. You know, the main character on that 80’s TV show of the same name about a crime fighting hero and his talking car. Crazy, you say? Well, we live in a crazy world: a place where the automobile is finally automated and the self-steering steering wheel could be just within our figurative grasp. 

We don’t know what the future holds, but we do know that previous generations had high hopes for what lay ahead. If you were to look at World’s Fairs and tech expos of 100, 50 and even 25 years ago, the industries of the past thought we’d be much further along than we are now. Just watch reruns of The Jetsons and you’ll see we’re nowhere near the flying cars and floating cities imagined by the animators of the 1960’s. But that doesn’t mean we haven’t taken technology insanely far in the time since the last industrial revolution. As a new period of massive change is upon us, it’s hard to really notice the huge advances occurring as we speak, from the tall cityscapes developing over our heads to the inner-data-spaces being explored by the phones in our pockets. 

Sure, it’s scary. This technology could take away jobs from drivers and give machines more power than some ever thought possible. Even so, it’s interesting to see what’s actually true and what about these technological wonders has been exaggerated. Take off your blinders and let TheHub be your GPS as we guide you to the real story.

Nothing Makes Sense Anymore | Lyrics

I used to know where the bottom was
Somewhere far under the ocean waves
Up on a ledge I was looking down
It was far enough to keep me safe
But the ground was cracked open
Threw me in the ocean
Cast me out away at sea
And the waves are still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one’s left to answer me

My inside’s out / my left is right
My upside’s down / my black is white
I hold my breath / and close my eyes
And wait for dawn but there’s no light
Nothing makes sense anymore anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore anymore

I used to sleep without waking up
In a dream I made from painted walls
I was a moment away from done
When the black spilled out across it all
And my eyes were made sober
World was turned over
Washing out the lines I’d seen
And my heart is still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one’s left to answer me

I’m a call without an answer
I’m a shadow in the dark
Trying to put it back together
As I watch it fall apart",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xMTsul4UFl8/sddefault.jpg,0.022363505570125498,0.0002429520675564273,92.04904405652536,0.00100836215570178,0.022606457637681925,0.023614819793383705,2018-03-29,14:00:28,Thursday,3,9,21,9,20,59,162,3,31,0,0,8,21,0,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.127372177425164,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Thanks to our sponsor, new members get their 1st month of the Dollar Shave Club Starter Set including the Executive Razor and trial-sized versions of their Shave Butter, Body Cleanser and One Wipe Charlies’ Butt Wipes for ONLY $5 (and free shipping). After that razors are just a few bucks a month.

Building off 15 previous videos, I make soap from scratch starting from rocks, wood ash, lake water, and a variety of plant and animal fats I've collected so far; launching our newest series on detergents and toiletries.

Thank you to our talented interns Randi and Donna (http://donnalynnart.com) who helped with both the beginning animation and with the testing of the soaps at the end!

|| ABOUT ||
Today, getting what you need is as easy as a trip to the store. From food to clothing, energy, medicine, and so much more, Andy George will discover what it takes to make everything from scratch. His mission is to understand the complex processes of manufacturing that is often taken for granted and do it all himself. Each week he’s traveling the world to bypass the modern supply chain in order to harvest raw materials straight from the source. Along the way, he’s answering the questions you never thought to ask.

Warum das Laden eines Elektroautos unsicher ist

Wir retten das Klima mit Elektroautos — und bauen die Ladeinfrastruktur massiv aus. Leider werden dabei auch Schwachstellen auf allen Ebenen sichtbar: Von fehlender Manipulationssicherheit der Ladesäulen bis hin zu inhärent unsicheren Zahlungsprotokollen und kopierbaren Zahlkarten. Ladesäulenhersteller und Ladenetzbetreiber lassen ihre Kunden im Regen stehen — geht das schnelle Wachstum des Marktanteils zu Lasten der Kundensicherheit?

After month and months of conjecture, speculation and wishful thinking, we can FINALLY confirm that Khloe is in fact pregnant. 

On the first Day of Christmas, my true love gave to me confirmation of her first pregnancy!

It’s true, good news does come in threes, Kim and Kylie who are due in January and now Khloe who will be six months pregnant in January. 

The rumor mills have been whirring since september about Ms Khloe and then-boyfriend now fiancé basketball star Tristan Thompson. On Christmas, as a gift to all of her fans and followers, Khloe posted a gorgeous photo of her and Tristan’s hands lovingly holding her glistening baby bump, with the emotional caption: QUOTE “My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! …Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you’ve been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love!”

She then followed up with a FABULOUS full length photo of her in an epic sparkly body suit, looking INCREDIBLE and showing off her baby bump in Kardashian-high stilettos at the family’s Christmas party, wishing everyone a sparkly Merry Christmas and using the hashtag #BabyBump. 

When asked on TWitter, Khloé revealed that she would be 6 months along next week, so we can expect the baby in April. It’s not uncommon to keep pregnancies a private matter until you make it to the final trimester, and sources have revealed that Khloé has really enjoyed stepping away from the spotlight for the past few months. According to a source in People magazine, “Khloé is ecstatic about being pregnant. She has been fine with being out of the spotlight. It’s like she realized that she needed a break. The baby is a huge blessing in many ways.”

Well, we’re just glad she, Tristan and her child-to-be are happy, healthy, and ready to join the world in April. WEll, what do you think of the news? Were you surprise at ALL and how incredible does Khloé look? Sound off in the comments below, make sure to subscribe and when you’re done with that, click right over here to check out the name Kylie picked out for her kid! Thank you so much for hanging out with me on Clevver News, I’m Zoë Lillian, and I’ll see you next time.

We came to Punjab specifically to eat. We tried a ton of Indian street food all over the streets of India and made a great street food vlog you will love. Street food in India is truly amazing and you MUSt eat it. In Amritsar, we specifically came to try the spicy and delicious Indian recipes on the street, and couldn't get enough. When you enter the Golden temple, you immediately feel a sense of peace over you and you can enjoy some delicious Indian food too! This is my Indian food documentary from the Golden Temple!

Punjabi food is so delicious! In the Golden Temple and all throughout Amritsar, you can try amazing Indian food!! The curry is the best, the dal we had was amazing, and it truly was a street food adventure!

Learning how to invest in cryptocurrency before putting your money into it is extremely important.

Unlike banks, credit unions, or traditional stock exchanges, there are no pre-built fail safes in this technology to protect your funds. It's up to you to take the necessary steps before buying cryptocurrency to ensure the security of your investments.

Cryptocurrency is cutting-edge technology, it’s the modern day wild wild west, so it requires some focused time and energy to wrap your head around. 

Luckily for you, I’ve done a lot of the leg work to compile this step-by-step guide to ensure you receive the knowledge and understanding you need to be successful in cryptocurrency investments.

In this step-by-step video, you will be walked through the process of setting up passwords, new email accounts, 2-factor authentication apps, wallets, malware protection, and all the essential steps you need to take to protect yourself.

Always remember the golden rule of investing: NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose. High risk can lead high reward and we humans have a natural tendency to want to overreach.

But you need to figure out an amount you are comfortable investing and, more importantly, an amount you can truly afford to invest - then you need to stick with that amount and be patient in the process.
 
Cryptocurrency is a lot more volatile and unpredictable than the stock market. Unlike the 9 to 5 New York stock exchange, cryptocurrency is traded around the world 24/7. 

So if you want to get a good night’s sleep as a crypto investor, you need to budget the amount of money you are going to invest and stick to it.

You will learn how to buy cryptocurrency in 10 easy steps. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about how to buy cryptocurrency.

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

This might actually be among the worst games I've ever had the misery of playing.

The fact they want $24.99 for this broken ripoff is just the semen on the cake.

When Fitzgerald became director of the Atlanta-based CDC back in July, she was required to sell a range of stocks she owned. However, according to Fitzgerald's ethics agreement with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Democratic senator Patty Murray says Fitzgerald has been unable to divest from certain investments that could prevent her from talking about certain cancer and prescription drug monitoring programs. Murray has since called on Fitzgerald to release more information about the investments and to meet with the Senate Committee of Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.

It’s only been a little over a month since our worlds were turned upside down when Selena Gomez was spotted hanging out with her notorious ex Justin Bieber. If you haven’t been following the Selena, The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, and Justin saga, here’s a quick recap.

Selena and Justin were seen hanging out again. Selena and Abel broke up. Selena and Justin were seen kissing and then Abel was spotted leaving Bella Hadid’s New York City apartment. Phew, that’s a lot of info. 

Just when we thought it was all over, Abel throws a curveball by unfollowing Sel on Instagram. Yes, it may be simple, but everyone knows that an Instagram unfollow is basically the final nail in the Abelena coffin. 

Although multiple sources said that the two were going to remain friends post-split, we’re pretty sure that they don’t have any intentions of following through. We’ve only seen Abel hang out with Bella once, but we wouldn’t be surprised if he pulled a Selena and got back with his ex, too. 

We have been getting serious nostalgia over all the new Jelena news, so much so that it’s already difficult to even remember a time when the two WEREN’T together. With the holiday season now in full-swing, we were hopeful that Thanksgiving would give us another peak into the couple’s celebrations. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed because Sel and JB gave thanks separately.

Justin returned to his home in Canada and played hockey, but Selena wasn’t there to cheer him on! Instead she was down in Texas with her family. Although they weren’t really together, we’re sure they sent each other some sweet holiday messages. 

Do you love seeing Selena and Justin back together or do you with Abelena was still an item? Let us know in the comments below! I’m Drew Dorsey, thanks for tuning in!

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

The Soviet Union lasted a mere sixty-nine years (the Spitfire has been flying longer), but in that time produced some of the largest, fastest, toughest and most agile aircraft. Even now, 25 years after its collapse, almost all Russian and Ukrainian aircraft have their roots in the communist super state.  Favouring clever robust design over high technology and refinement, the Soviet approach enabled the mass production of cheap machines. Many of these were outstanding, but some – for reasons of politics, bad luck or incompetence – were diabolical. Let’s pack beer and vobla, and take a walk through the rusting graveyard of the eleven worst Soviet aircraft.

LYRICS:
For now we’ll lay by the ocean 
For now no one is around
For now we’ll act we’re still young
For now we’ll never come down

I know you’re not empty 
I know you’re still there 

I know you’re not empty
I know 

You still care 

I remember you back in the day
Prodigy show 2003 
We were camping out in Jnco jeans 
The ecstasy was super clean

Higher than all of their voices
Higher than fading away 
Got lost, lost in the moment
Got lost in tempting our fate

And you can rub it in my face
Sabotage all my connections
The Parasites won’t go away 
They live inside you 
Got nothing clean for you to taint 
Already gave you a confession
Propagating every consequence
Til hate consumes you

I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho 
I never wanted to be singing about you again
I couldn’t face another second of the vacant threats 
I couldn’t shuffle through pieces of my costume 
I never wanted to be singing about you again

God damn
You caught me looking back
God damn
With no discretion
God damn
You got me going mad 
God damn
It’s an obsession

Lyrics:
Reeling in the line
Fully saccharine
All these stagnant words which I confide
Perish in the night
Anyway so,
Here we go again
Always faintly preying 
Did I note a tremble on your arm
thereupon alarmed
Just give in

Make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it
Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it

Time moves forward quickly
Moves in twenty-four-hour segments
Racing for the soul to grab chokehold
Of the minute hands
Left without a trace
Just a fleeting face
Flicker as a figment once before my eyes
Perished in the night

You want it, you want it, you want it again
Why don't you come and ask me, I adore you my friend
I said you need it, you need it, you need it again
Trust me, these arbitrary thrills will never fail to transcend

Make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it
Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it

Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it
Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it 
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it

I said you want it, you want it, you want it again
Why don't you come and ask me, I adore you my friend
I said you need it, you need it, you need it again
Trust me, these arbitrary thrills they never fail to transcend
Make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it
Catch it

Charlie Puth - Change (Lyrics) feat. James Tylor (Lyrics)
[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got?
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make the change

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Look around there are so, many of us crying
Not enough love to go around
What a waste of a day
A good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we are all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why can’t we just get along?
If love is right and war is wrong
And how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make the change, yeah

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Why are we human beings to deny somebody?
A chance to be there, so
No, what a waste it would be if we hurt another?
But I know the world will change
The day we are all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why can’t we just get along?
If love is right and war is wrong?
And how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make a change, yeah

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
I know we could break apart
We don’t have to go that way
But today

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why can’t we just get along?
If love is right and war is wrong
And how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
Why can’t we just get along?
If love is right and war is wrong
And how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make the change, yeah

[Outro: Charlie Puth]
The change, yeah

Its new features are an 18:9, full-screen design, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and a new dual-camera system that swaps the telephoto lens for a brighter one that should work better in low light. There's also a new face unlock feature that can unlock the phone just by looking at you. Otherwise, the 5T has the same high-end internals as the OnePlus 5, including a Snapdragon 835 processor and up to 8GB of RAM. You'll be able to buy the OnePlus 5T direct from the company starting on November 21st.

Lyrics: 
No flask can keep it
Bubble up and cut right through
But you're someone I believe in
You heat me like a filament
Anytime you're in the room
But you burned me and I'm smoking
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
Can't find an exit
I wander in a maze alone
If I find you will you shock me?
Left left and right right
Pretty sure that I've been here before
And It isn't what I wanted
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
Your voice like an angel
Been chain smoking all month long
Like you're someone I believe in
Am I only a lab rat?
Someone you can test things on?
This isn't what I signed up for
I just wanted you to

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt
Kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
Slowly
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve

Global megastar Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure “Rampage,” directed by Brad Peyton.  

Primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   

“Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”), and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”), Jason Liles (“Death Note”), Demetrius Grosse (TV’s “The Brave”), Will Yun Lee (TV’s “Hawaii Five-O”).  

Peyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. “Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. 

The creative team includes director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”); production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”); editors Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and Bob Ducsay; and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music is composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”

The “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).

“Rampage” opens in theaters worldwide beginning April 20, 2018.

A New Line Cinema presentation, in association with ASAP Entertainment, a Wrigley Pictures/FPC/7 Bucks Entertainment production, a Brad Peyton Film, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros.

Any fan of Coca-Cola will tell you it tastes better from a fountain, and anyone who's ever had it from McDonald's will tell you their fountain Coke is just about the best there is. So what's their secret? Are they serving up a higher quality of Coca-Cola than other restaurants?

Tomi Joutsen about 'The Bee':
""Of course, the lyrical inspiration is a bee, also in a metaphoric way. The tiniest thing can sometimes be the most important thing. A bee can bring life or if we destroy all the bees, life will stop here. It's a very beautiful animal, that's why you can find it on the album cover too. The track itself is a kind of progressive and I'm sure that it will surprise some fans in a positive way. We love it!""

Kensington Palace revealed May 16 the bridesmaids will be Princess Charlotte, 3, the daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and Harry's godchildren, Florence van Cutsem, 3, and Zalie Warren, 2.

Meghan’s goddaughters Remi Litt, 6, and Rylan Litt, 7, will join her close friend's daughter, Ivy Mulroney, 4, as part of the bridal party.

My goal is to create a fun and positive place on the Internet for people to come and feel uplifted. I document my life as an author, presenter, blogger and columnist, but most importantly my roles as wife to Tom and mum to Buzz and Buddy.

Each Friday at 9AM I upload a new video in a series called DEAR CARRIE, essentially video diaries to my sister in law who we never get to see. Tom adds his thoughts into the mix on Sundays with Carrie replying on Wednesdays. 

Monday's is MUMDAYS - with new uploads going live every Monday morning at 9AM. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhdL...

The Collider staff could not be more excited to visit the world of Wakanda and see what this latest installment from Marvel has in store for us. But before we walk into the theaters to watch the movie, we decided to do another Collider Scoreboard video.

Host John Rocha asks some of your favorite Collider personalities 6 questions about what might be happening in the film. They also offer a wildcard answer about some surprise we might see in the film. Obviously, none of the participants have watched the film yet. The answers will be logged in and we’ll shoot a follow up video with the winner who got the most answers right. Let us know what your answers are in the Comments section below and if you have your own predictions for what we might see in the movie.

We meet Josh Tulberg, an industrial designer who fabricated a mini boat of his own design, using his workshop laser cutter and 3D printer. Josh shows us how his boat kit is put together using zip ties and epoxy, and we take his boat on the water to test its seaworthiness. And it surpassed all of our expectations!

The film directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Ny’Ongo, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. Early buzz on the film has been incredible and it has already outsold every other superhero movie according to Fandango’s pre-sale movie ticketing service. The film focuses on T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king.

John Rocha and Jay Washington are here to give you their Non-Spoiler review of the film and give you their impressions of what Coogler has created here. They explore the direction, acting, music, and costumes of the film. They also let you know if the film lives up to the early hype.

I am still going to be releasing new homemade squishy updates and due to a huge number of request, TUTORIALS are coming soon! :)

IMPORTANT: I explain all of this more thoroughly in my updates, but since there were so many squishies to go through, I didn't have time to explain everything. Most of the squishies you will see are made from POLYFOAM which is an expanding foam that you use in molds. I did make them myself, but they are not hand-cut like typical homemade squishies. I have a tutorial on my channel. ALSO, I did include decorated squishies in here which are store bought and just painted on (all hello kitty donuts and the swirly ice cream cones). 

NO COMMENTARY (SHORT VERSION):
https://youtu.be/irdffxW6ZdE


Probably 95% of these are my own original designs. Occasionally I will use inspiration from someone else, but I always try to give credit in my updates. 
Feel free to take any of my ideas for designs, no need to ask permission! 

FULL HOMEMADE SQUISHY VIDEO PLAYLIST:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL807ptvhwHpc5aFRnn5Ir2jvzx3oZK6FH

SQUISHY COLLECTION FACTS:
–289 TOTAL squishies in this video. I've made over 300 hundred including ones I have sold.
–mostly made from polyfoam, but also includes memory foam, makeup sponge and decorated squishies
–Oldest squishy is a year and a half old
– Besides the density foam hardening a little (only where pieces are glued together), there are no defects or missing pieces
(I found the tag that was missing from the strawberry hello kitty donut, it was laying in the box LOL)
–Most used words/phrases in this video: 
                            CAKE, rainbow, favorite

*Sorry if my commentary gets a little repetitive at points. It is harder than it looks to come up with unique commentary for 300 squishies haha


MY UPLOAD SCHEDULE:

Every Friday: Alternating drawing videos (create this book & this is not a book) AND craft/DIY videos

AND

Some Mondays: Squishy Updates, mail openings, vlogs, announcements, unboxing videos, show and tell etc.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the #PaintballsUpGunsDown movement has gotten out of control and could backfire if officers mistake a paintball gun for a real firearm. 

The grassroots movement first gained traction on social media in early April as a proposed way to resolve conflicts with paint instead of bullets. Since then, participants from Atlanta to Detroit have engaged in full blown paintball wars on city streets, with as many as 50 shooters taking aim at each other at once, hitting innocent bystanders and marking up cars and homes. 

Over the last week, police in Detroit started making arrests for destruction of property. Paintballers say they're being targeted for being young and black and that cleaning up paint is a lot better than picking up dead bodies.

Jordan Rennie - Greetings from Scotland!  Since you've now seen Solo: A Star Wars Story how do you think it will do at the box office?  Do you think it will pass the billion dollar mark?  Thanks for taking my question and keep up the great work.

Rob Cameron - I'm I the only one getting sick to death of all the TLJ & star wars haters who are supposedly fans. Now encouraging fans to boycott solo!!! Why r they doing this John!

Our fave ever Millie Bobby Brown was spotted jammin out on the side of the stage at Jacob Sarorius’ concert and the world can’t handle it. 

Okay guys and gals – I get it I love MBB too but part of me is also like just let this girl live. 

SO here’s the story – a few weeks back word broke that Millie and internet star Jacob Sartorius were dating or whatever and everyone, including every grown adult person on earth had some sort of weird opinion about it. Also – did I forget to mention MBB and Jacob are literally 13 and 15 years old respectively? Okay let’s move on. IN response to the media storm surround their relationship, Millie retweeted an article with a headline that read “is it really okay to talk about the love life of a famous 13 year old?” And I’m totally with you girl – when I was 13 I was drooling on myself and trying to get popcorn out of my braces. 

At any rate, the internet has exploded again because Millie was spotted boppin’ around backstage at Jacob’s concert. Honestly, she looks like she’s having a blast. She’s such a busy bee and works so hard, I’m so beyond glad to see her getting to be 13 and have fun. Good for her – good for him – good for everyone. 
So guys what do we think about this supposed dating confirmation? And what do you think about on the flip my message to everyone to let this girl live? Hit the comments to join the convo and then click here to peep yesterday’s ep of Daily Hollywood Rundown. I’m ya girl Joslyn Davis thanks for hanging -see you tomorrow.

Here is an comprehensive guide on how to film the keyboard with an overhead angle.  I go over the details of my setup, and also try to recreate the look using lower budget options.  None of the products are sponsored, nor do I recommend them specifically -- there are many products similar to the ones I use that get the job done.  The most important factors are having a wide angle camera lens and a tripod.

Here's a link to the products I show in the video:

The Non-Canon Expert explains why it's likely that the scenes depicted in both of the new Solo: A Star Wars Story teaser trailers show Han Solo not only making the Kessel Run, but the specific Kessel Run he made in under 12 parsecs that he boasts about to Obi-Wan and Luke in A New Hope.

My goal is to create a fun and positive place on the Internet for people to come and feel uplifted. I document my life as an author, presenter, blogger and columnist, but most importantly my roles as wife to Tom and mum to Buzz and Buddy.

Each Friday at 9AM I upload a new video in a series called DEAR CARRIE, essentially video diaries to my sister in law who we never get to see. Tom adds his thoughts into the mix on Sundays with Carrie replying on Wednesdays. 

New to Monday's is MUMDAYS - with new uploads going live every Monday morning at 9AM. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhdL...

BMW Electric Drive HYPNOTIC VIDEO about HOW IT'S MADE BATTERY CELLS Production Assembly Line

► If you love cars you should SUBSCRIBE Now to Gommeblog Car and Performance Youtube Channel: http://goo.gl/sP8oKK

The BMW Group continues to focus on the implementation of its electro-mobility strategy, with the company concentrating all its technological expertise relating to battery cells at a new competence centre. 

The battery cell is the heart of the battery. It determines performance, energy content, charging capabilities and lifespan, thereby making a significant contribution to the performance of an electrified vehicle.

In the labs, research and prototyping facilities, which will make up the battery cell competence centre, specialist departments will analyse cell design and cell technology. They will also create prototypes of future battery cells, focusing on the chemical composition of the cells, use of different materials, how the cell behaves in critical or extremely cold conditions, charging and rapid-charging behaviour and evaluating cell sizes and forms. This in-house technological expertise is key to enhancing the battery, thereby enabling higher performance capabilities.

The BMW Group will also gain build-to-print expertise and can then contract out production of battery cells produced to its exact product requirements and specifications. This core competence – which covers the entire value chain from selection of materials, cell design, integration into battery systems, manufacturability and production technologies – gives the company a definite competitive edge, while leveraging cost benefits and economies of scale.

The BMW Group has already completed years of research into battery cells and acquired a high level of evaluation competence, especially through the development of the BMW i models. The company will concentrate know-how from various specialist departments and locations at the new Battery Cell Competence Centre and step up its efforts in this area to achieve faster impact. Research findings will be incorporated directly into the latest battery generation. 

This interdisciplinary competence centre aims to advance battery cell technology and introduce it into production processes. The company will invest a total of 200 million euros in the location over the next four years, creating 200 jobs. The centre will open in early 2019.

The British architect spray-painted the 10-metre-high temporary structure with Vantablack VBx2, a substance that absorbs over 99 per cent of light.

Vantablack VBx2, is a sprayable version of Vantablack pigment, which British artist Anish Kapoor controversially acquired exclusive rights for in 2016.

Rods tipped with tiny white lights protrude from the ""super-black"" parabolic curves of all four sides of the pavilion, giving the impression of stars suspended against the darkness of space.

Speaking to Dezeen, Khan – who describes himself as a ""closet astronaut"" – said he ""wanted to create the impression of a window cut into space"".

""It's a preoccupation of mine, trying to create experiences to better understand where we are now as humans, placing ourselves in the big picture,"" said Khan.

We also go a bit deeper in our analysis of her kit to try and identify her best and most effective playstyle. Suffice to say, Brigitte likes to fight and fight at close quarters. This makes her the Queen of brawling as far as the support slot goes. Incredibly fun and satisfying to play, she can be absolutely devastating when used in the right way, at the right time. We hope you like the video and it contains everything you need to know to get to grips with her.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Hidden inside a smartphone, the bustling city of Textopolis is home to all emojis. Each emoji has only one facial expression, except for Gene, an exuberant emoji with multiple expressions. Determined to become ""normal"" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his best friend Hi-5 and a notorious code breaker called Jailbreak. During their travels through the other apps, the three emojis discover a great danger that could threaten their phone's very existence.

Hoje ela saiu de casa
Só pensando em mexer
Sem segundas intenções
Sem tocar, sem beijar
Ela não vai se envolver

A gata é uma loucura
Faz cena proibida
E mantém postura
Depois da meia-noite
É filme com censura
Sensualidade pura

Gosta de fazer o
Ta Ta Ta Tum Tum
Quicando e mostrando
O poder desse bumbum

Vai mexendo o bumbum
Vai mexendo o bumbum
Faz o movimento no talento

Hey, it's Mayim, and I hate having difficult conversations. But after reading the book 'Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most' by Douglas Stone, I learned ways to have more productive conversations, and now you can too! Do you hate having difficult conversations? Tell me in the comments!

Lyrics:
Listen to me carefully
These hoes are scared of me
Don’t wanna be compared to me
Failure is rare to me
Your man pull out my chair for me
He wanna marry me
My haters give me clarity and popularity
I’m so fuckin bossy it’s a burden
Every thing I serve it like a verdict
Russian Dutch and German
Flow that make you nervous
In my juicy wagon 22’s lookin murderous

I pop my shoulder that picture get exposure
Got B’s like Oprah my patience is bipolar
I thought I told ya don’t press me or I’ll roll ya
I won’t be tolerating shit from nobody cuz

I am that bitch
I’mma I’mma that bitch
You know I’m that bitch
Can’t get off of this dick
I am that bitch
You know I’m that bitch
I am that bitch
You know I’m that bitch

My sex appeal will knock you out
Mayweather fifty rounds
In labels you cannot pronounce
Les a achetés en France
Marilyn without the bleach
And with the glasses on
I’m 20 outta 20 please
Try not to cry on me
Now that all my dreams are manifesting
Face is even bitchy when it resting
I could write a million songs
In my zone I do no wrong
Chillin at the crib t-shirt with no panties on

I make the typical chicks pick up a twitch
QH initial gold stamp on my kicks
Lay it out for me gracefully I don’t trip
I kick it real as I can kick it no script
Go on and hate me I feel you my reputation proceed you
You talkin down I don’t hear you my interjection is lethal
Black cashmere sweater is see through my icy glare need a skidoo
You heard of me guarantee you cuz all your friends saying queen who?
It’s Herby baby and I ate so much cake
It’s my birthday every day and I be staying in LA
Got so much sun don’t mind the shade that shit sound like a serenade
While all of my haters be fadin away
See I might go ahead and replace all your favorites",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y-3unYek7XA/sddefault.jpg,0.022455651930522555,0.0008265769156997758,27.167044595616023,0.0007503544034432582,0.02328222884622233,0.02403258324966559,2018-03-02,04:46:15,Friday,4,7,79,7,67,35,588,3,140,2,4,3,71,1,3,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.715352962713583,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

A young man is hitchhiking across New Zealand, making his way through the striking stretches of landscape. But he's not just enjoying the scenery -- he's on a search for his birth mother, and by extension, his identity.

Along the way, he encounters an intimidating man with unsavory tattoos inked all over his body -- and discovers just what ""family"" really means.

Director Matthew Saville's gem of a drama may feature a situation not everyone can relate to, but the skilled script and finely tuned directing helps viewers to understand the desire for connection and understanding -- and thirst for love -- that drives the main character.

Lincoln's flagship SUV arguably started the big luxury SUV segment, but later versions lacked the luxury feel and ""bling"" that you'd expect out of a six-figure people mover. To remedy that Lincoln pulled out all the stops for the all-new fourth-generation Navigator which is more luxurious than ever and is truly the flagship vehicle the Lincoln brand has been looking for. Looking for acres of real wood? Check. Premium interior finishes? Check. Bling? You got it. Special models named after a chalet and a yacht? Yup. Twin-turbo V6 and a 10-speed transmission? What else would you expect? 

Of course specs are one thing, execution is another and here is where Lincoln has really excelled. The new Navigator is truly a vehicle that (if you're interested in a big SUV of course) can compete head on with not just the Cadillac, but the large SUVs from Europe as well. No kidding.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y06zt7wPzRs/sddefault.jpg,0.010777244524526882,0.00033298202166751533,32.36584507042254,-1.1724719072799835e-07,0.011110226546194396,0.011110109299003669,2018-01-12,06:30:01,Friday,4,4,38,3,33,21,334,0,79,0,1,4,14,0,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0765698638559975,3,"['happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,3,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

--------------------------------------------- 
The thought of reincarnation terrifies some people and pleases others. Personally I hate the thought of having to relive an entire life all over again, it not only scares me but it mentally exhausting just to think about. Judging by some of our stories you can end up in the same culture doing the same things, so where is your lives lesson in that. It makes it seem that I’m going back onto a treadmill, that I cannot get off. We’ve discovered some 6 astonishing reincarnation tales, some which will give you hope, whilst others are surrounded by disturbing circumstances.

Today we are going to learn how to put the ESP32 chip into the Deep Sleep mode in order to conserve power and make our projects battery friendly. There is a lot to cover so let's get started!

The ESP32 chip is a fantastic new chip with great features. It offers a lot of processing power, two 32 bit cores, a lot of memory, Bluetooth and WiFi in a small and easy to use chip. One of the most interesting things about the ESP32 chip is that it offers a low-power deep sleep mode which is very easy to use. Let's see how to use it.

Full disclosure: All of the links above are affiliate links. I get a small percentage of each sale they generate. Thank you for your support!

Inside the ESP32 chip, we can find the two processing cores, the RAM and ROM memory, the WiFi module, the Bluetooth Module, a hardware acceleration module for cryptographic applications, the RTC module, and a lot of peripherals. Inside the RTC module, we can find a PMU (Phasor measurement unit) a small and very low power 32-bit co-processor, and 8Kbs of RAM memory. This small amount of memory is very useful as you are going to find out in a moment. Also note, even the RTC memory of the ESP32 chip is 4 times larger than the memory of the Arduino Uno.

The WiFi modules, the Processing Cores, and the Bluetooth module require a lot of current to operate. So, if we want to conserve power we have to disable them when don't use them. This is what we are going to do now. We are going to put the ESP32 to Deep – Sleep mode where it disables everything except the RTC module. There is a light sleep mode and the Deep – Sleep mode. In Deep Sleep mode the ESP32 offers the lowest power consumption. It just needs 0.01 mAs of current in Deep Sleep mode and that's why we are going to try today.

[N.Flying]

The pleasant band N.Flying came back. Its new album contained the desire of the band hoping to be ‘the hottest band in the world’ like the name of the album ‘THE HOTTEST : N.Flying.’ The title track ‘Hot Potato’ revealed the ambitious goal of N.Flying in a cheerful mood to be talk of the town someday.
