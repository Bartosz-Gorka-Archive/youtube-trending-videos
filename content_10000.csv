About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:
The Screen Actors Guild Awards® presented by SAG-AFTRA has become one of the industry's most prized honors. The only televised awards show to exclusively honor performers; it presents thirteen awards for acting in film and television in a fast moving two-hour show, which airs live on TNT and TBS. The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

Not many people saw JUSTICE LEAGUE when it came out last year, so you may not know why this movie is perhaps the Scariest thing DC has ever made. I'm not kidding. Superman literally obliterates Earth at the end of the movie, and I can prove it!

In almost every animal species on Earth, equal numbers of males and females are conceived. Why is that? Especially in populations like lions or elephant seals, where most males don’t get to mate? That’s survival of the laziest, not survival of the fittest. It turns out that in most cases, an equal balance of the sexes is the evolutionary stable strategy. From Charles Darwin to Ronald Fisher to W.D. Hamilton to Richard Dawkins, the question of why there’s as many males as females has fascinated biologists. Today, we’ll explain why that is the way it is.

IDGAF Lyrics ✍️🎤
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye

I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fvck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye

I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fvck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fvck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fvck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (Get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fvck

Case in point is the infotainment system’s large nine-inch touchscreen display, which is flush-mounted atop the floating center stack that descends and elegantly curves into the center console. The screen is also flanked by eight physical buttons (four on each side) and two control knobs, thus ensuring not all inputs must be made by using the touchscreen alone.
As for comfort, the Touring model moves the Avalon from fluff to firm. This trim level receives special front seats with the highest degree of adjustability. The adaptive suspension is also more stiffly tuned, which is great for increasing feedback from the road, but not so great for soaking up bumps. Likewise, the din inside is louder, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Engine Sound Enhancement system that amplifies the V6’s sound through the stereo system.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4Z3wlhTzH8/sddefault.jpg,0.004479528866334618,0.000422892585283338,10.592592592592592,0.0004385552736271654,0.004902421451617954,0.005340976725245121,2018-01-15,12:49:59,Monday,0,8,59,5,17,50,422,1,46,0,0,3,23,0,0,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.429591428679694,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Phoenix, Arizona, USA

For me, one of the ultimate American food meals to eat is awesome BBQ - when the meat is smoked perfectly so it slides off the bone, and the flavor is packed full of insane smokiness. My brother in law Derek had already been to Little Miss BBQ, but it was my first time to eat here, and I was so excited.

I arrived a little over an hour early to get in line, but luckily as soon as you pull up you get a number so that you don’t actually have to wait in line the entire time. 

Scott and the entire crew at Little Miss BBQ are amazing, and you can immediately feel their passion and their genuine love for what they do and for the people they get to interact with everyday as a result of serving the best BBQ in Phoenix! Scott and his wife have an interesting and amazing grassroots history and start to their BBQ business. They first started making BBQ at home just because they loved doing it. Eventually they started competing in American BBQ competitions. At the beginning things didn’t go so well, but they kept going and perfecting their BBQ recipes and eventually started to win some of the competitions. Eventually they opened Little Miss BBQ, and it’s one of the best BBQ spots you’ll ever eat at.

So after getting the full tour of the restaurant and all the smoked meat, it was about time to open. You line up outside and the actual inside is quite small - most people either takeaway or eat outside.

I wanted to try a little of everything, so we got a giant tray of smoked BBQ meat including pork ribs, pulled pork, turkey, sausage, brisket, and beef ribs, with sides. Total price for the entire tray came to $92.70 - that was a lot of meat!

Thanks to my brother in law Derek for coming out to eat as well. We started with the beef ribs, and those are the best of the best. The meat falls apart and it was so insanely juicy and flavorful. The BBQ brisket will also blow you mind with its massive meaty flavor and juiciness. Finally my other top meat was the sausage, including jalapeno and a mix of meat and bacon.

Lastly, you have to eat your American food bbq feast with their famous pecan pie. And even though I’m not into sweets, a few bites at the end was amazing.

Little Miss BBQ is a phenomenal BBQ restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. Not only will the quality and taste of the meat blow you away, but the passion of Scott and the entire crew are so genuine and so friendly, and that’s what makes it so good.

Thank you for watching this BBQ video!

You may be thinking, ""Jimmy, the fuck man? It's Tuesday and if you look a couple weeks back to your video titled 'Meeting With The Studio', you clearly promised a video every Monday for 15 weeks"", and you're right, I did. And I was totally planning on uploading it yesterday until my editing program started rainbow balling on me because we shot this in 8k so the footage is ridiculously fucking large. For those of you who aren't tech savvy; 8k is double 4k and yes that exists. If you are tech savvy, you're probably going to say something like, 'You need more RAM space, edit with proxys,  blah blah blah"" but I did all of that shit, okay? My RAM port is loaded with RAM, all of it. Speaking of which, Rams are going off this year which is super dope. Last year I was like 'Eh, I'm gonna hop on board because I've never had a football team in LA so might as well' but this year it's official. That's actually a nice segway into my other point here, funny how that works. Realistically, I shouldn't have even been editing this video yesterday. I should've finished on Sunday like I planned, but next thing I know I'm leaving the Rams game hammered in some white hummer limo with Kyle and like 15 other people I didn't know and I didn't really want to edit this video in that state of mind which I'm sure you can understand. Also, don't think I've been on a hummer limo since high school but hey, life happens. Anyways, I don't really feel like these explanations are THAT necessary anymore since most of you seem to be very understanding when it comes to the fact that I have nowhere near as much time to make videos as I used to. Which is great by the way. Subscribers being assholes about videos being late is just crazy. That's not directed at you guys, like I said, you're quite understanding these days, I'm just kind of thinking out loud here about YouTube in general. It's good that we have these talks from time to time. I'd like to keep going here but it's coming up on 11:30am and I gotta go do some voiceover stuff. I'm going to click upload now. See you next Monday.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C6Y25qvWu6I/sddefault.jpg,0.036133660364806836,0.0003195235432541901,113.0860655737705,0.0017586890106163007,0.03645318390806103,0.03821187291867733,2017-11-28,19:42:44,Tuesday,1,2,51,2,35,18,408,0,52,0,0,2,0,0,9,8.0,7.0,['STG'],['STG'],True,['stg'],1,1,3,0,0,0,0,6.618788783528278,2,"['happy', 'sad']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Who doesn't love a heartwarming portrait of best friendship? However, a testament to the power of acting is the seeming chemistry of some of TV's ""best friends,"" when in reality, the actors playing those characters hate each other's guts.

It seems crazy that fast food restaurants like McDonald's can stay in business when the cost of their food is so low. How can anyone really turn a profit offering dollar menus, coupons, and value meals? While it may seem like fast food restaurants are pricing themselves out of business, the most successful ones employ lots of tricks to make sure patrons keep coming back. Plus, there are some factors most people don't consider. For example ...

Real estate | 0:23
Limited menus | 1:12
Upselling diners | 1:47
Cashing in on extras | 3:03
Low prices, low wages | 3:32

LYRICS:
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
I’m finding flaws in every format
I know but haven’t shown that I could pick myself up off the floor
I’ll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside I seem fine
On the inside I’m still sick
The pill is a temporary fix
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralyzed before
We’re all looking for some answers with the hangman’s broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
Why do I feel so damn cold?
Why am I still so low?
Why should I get up or get out?
Why should I?
Why?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C7I6J_cRr4E/sddefault.jpg,0.011150885279516985,0.00033408840965154035,33.377049180327866,0.0005969776500330803,0.011484973689168523,0.012081951339201605,2018-06-04,18:59:45,Monday,0,9,49,9,48,54,315,3,49,0,1,8,46,2,14,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.149299010110704,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Ten years in the making, Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of all of Marvel's awesome efforts on the big screen, marking the end of many things… and very likely the beginning of even more things. And even though Infinity War is pretty focused on the here and now rather than the deeper secrets hidden within the pages of Marvel Comics, this movie didn't disappoint True Believers. In fact, its many true-to-comics scenes and unexpected callbacks stole the show. Here's a spoiler-filled look at a few of the Easter eggs you may have missed in Avengers: Infinity War. And one more time, in case you missed it: massive spoilers ahead...

My goal is to create a fun and positive place on the Internet for people to come and feel uplifted. I document my life as an author, presenter, blogger and columnist, but most importantly my roles as wife to Tom and mum to Buzz and Buddy.

Each Friday at 9AM I upload a new video in a series called DEAR CARRIE, essentially video diaries to my sister in law who we never get to see. Tom adds his thoughts into the mix on Sundays with Carrie replying on Wednesdays. 

Mondays are MUMDAYS - with new uploads going live every Monday morning at 9AM. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhdL...

Kanye West found himself at the center of yet another controversy after his pro-Trump tweets.

This episode is brought to you by Secret Active. New Secret Active provides protection in the moments when it matters most.

You may not agree with Kanye’s stance, but these celebrities do.

I think it’s safe to say that Twitter has been pretty wild ever since Yeezy decided to return to the social media platform. Kanye has been tweeting up a storm these days, but his recent pro-Trump tweets literally shook the world and many people just did not know how to feel about his opinion on the current President of the United States.

While it’s being reported that a TON and I mean A TON of celebrities unfollowed Yay after he revealed his thoughts on Donald Trump, quite a few famous figures came to Kanye’s defense.

To no one’s surprise, Kim hopped on Twitter to reveal her support for Kanye and his personal opinions. In a number of tweets, Kim said QUOTE, “He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours, you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive. Now when he spoke out about Trump… most people (including myself) have very different feelings and opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if it’s really different from mine. He never said he agrees with his politics. Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that’s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same thing but they aren’t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time.” Kim is literally the epitome of a ride or die chick.
Chance the Rapper also came to Kanye’s defense when a user asked if Yay had the chance to talk to Chance and a few others from his hometown of Chicago. Chance responded to the tweet by saying QUOTE, “Talked to him two days ago. He’s in a great space and not affected by folk tryna question his mental or physical health. Same Yay from the VMAs, same Yay from the telethon.” Chance shortly followed up that response with a tweet that read QUOTE, “Black people don’t have to be democrats.”
Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, “Love this!!! 2 years ago, who would’ve thought Kanye and Kim would be public enemy number one of Hollywood/Media for saying it’s okay to think differently and to express yourself as you see fit.”

Jedediah Bila, a former co-host on The View even tweeted her support for Kanye. She said QUOTE, “Welcome to how the mob treats someone with a different opinion. The good news? There are freedom lovers around this country fighting for his right to an opinion, whether we agree with him or not. I disagree with a lot of what Kanye has said over the years, but I will defend his right to an opinion consistently and vehemently.”

As you can see, there were a few celebs who defended Kanye’s right to express his personal opinions on Twitter, but not everyone felt the same way. It’s actually being reported that a large number of Kanye’s famous peers unfollowed him on Twitter and among those are his close friends, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, Travis Scott, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber…just to name a few.

So what do you guys think of all of this? Were you surprised to see all this support for Kanye and his views? Let me know in the comment section below! Thanks for watching Clevver Newsfeed, I’m Ava Gordy and I’ll see ya next time!

There isn’t a whole lot of footage, but most of the two days spent in Nara and Osaka were walking around in the local market and shops. 

Meeting the deer was an amazing experience, and everything I hoped it would be! They are such sweet creatures, and I feel blessed to have been able to bond with them on some level in the little time I spent in the park. 

Now, we are back to real time! Sorry that this vlog has followed up the rest after over a week. I meant to finish it a lot earlier- especially given that it isn’t even that long. But once finals finished, I took a deep sigh and really enjoyed that first week of break. I actually didn’t even vlog a lot in those days, so there won’t be much footage of that. It’s nice to get a rest from school work and classes, but in a way that break was also some time away from editing, constant filming, etc. I like to enjoy the moment sometimes without rushing to capture it through a lens. There is still plenty of footage on the back burner though! The next vlog will probably be choppy- one of those that is elapsed in a 3-4 week period. Oop.

Thank you for joining us on our journey, and for being here to share my stories with.

Sending you love and happiness, until next time,
Annabelle

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

오늘은 두바이! - 가장 리얼하고 익스트림한 두바이를 경험해봅니다!! 그 시작으로 24K 황금 코스요리를 먹어봐야죠, 당연히.

다음 주 수요일에는 두바이 현지인분과 함께 전통적인 현지 음식을 먹으러 갑니다!!

Today we are in Dubai - having the most legit Dubai-extreme experiences possible!! And to start - a 24K gold meal. Of course.

Next Wednesday we have the pleasure of having a local introduce traditional local food to us!!

Huge thanks to everyone involved in the creation of this video:

I am pretty sure the passengars of these flights will probably remember these flights for a long time. I decided to edit another video of yesterdays crosswind situation to focus on the small Dash-8 turboprob plane which definitly had some issues with the wind speeds. Some of them had to approach three times until they finally manged to land. It` s incredible to see how skilled some of these pilots are and this video definitly proves why pilots are definitly not overpaid. Great job!

“The Prodigy” was shot in Dornstadt, Germany, at the DUSS container depot. It wasn’t easy to record the whole video without any cut because the temperature was really cold. Furthermore, the location is a working area where 41 tons container are constantly moved, and for safety reasons we had to use the rare moments where no containers were being carried over our heads. The track includes three pieces by the English band “The Prodigy”: Invades Must Die, Omen, Voodoo People (credits below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We love watching athletes competing against one another during the Olympics, but some of them are less than honorable. Today, we are going to expose a long history of cheaters going all the way back to 1904. That was the year that runner Fred Lorz decided to just skip the middle of a race and take a car instead. If you think that’s brazen, wait until you hear about how Madeline de Jesus won her race after she pulled her hamstring. We had to admit, as wrong as cheating is, the way that Boris Onishchenko rigged up his fencing was pretty ingenious. Getting caught using illegal substances at the Olympics is bad, but Ben Johnson got caught not once, not twice, but three times! Michelle Smith was never officially caught, but she did get busted for tampering with her test results. Cameron van der Burgh confessed to cheating during his swimming event, and they even had to implement new cameras because of it.

During this challenge, Disney is seeking to inspire innovative filmmakers – especially female filmmakers - to step up and share their unique storytelling voice. One lucky winner will be awarded $100,000 to create their own film, a trip to Hollywood for the World Premiere of A Wrinkle in Time, and an all-new 2018 Nissan LEAF!

 To enter: www.AWITFilmChallenge.com 

Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres in 3D March 9th!
From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.

The Winchester House in San Jose, California, is no ordinary home. Whispers seem to come from the walls, staircases lead nowhere, doors open to nothing, and a groundskeeper roams the property doing work that is never done.
Despite the Winchester Mystery House’s cheerful appearance, this massive California mansion’s history is edged with a tale of violence, grief, madness, and guilt. Find out what exactly is inside one of the most haunted houses in America…
Sarah Winchester was a New England debutante who was possessed with brilliance, a child prodigy whose portfolio of talents stretched from literature, music, to languages. In Connecticut high society, she swiftly earned the title of “Belle of New Haven”.

청하 - 롤러코스터
솔로 아티스트로 성공적인 시작을 알린 청하가 두 번째 미니앨범 'Offset' 으로 돌아왔다 이번 앨범에는 청하의 무대 아래서의 자연스러운 일상과 무대 위 화려한 모습이 담겼다.

'Roller Coaster'는 누군가와 사랑에 빠졌을 때 너무나 달콤하지만 가끔은 아찔하고 위험한 기분을 느끼는 현재 상황을 롤러코스터에 비유하여 표현한 곡이다.

I wanted to share this video, to give you a reality of the relationship with my birth mother. I thank her all the time for bringing me into this world and even the decision she made to place me in an orphanage. She recently lost her previous husband after being married for so long and is now going through a lot of personal problems herself.

Recently Apple has been accused of slowing down old iPhones and they have since confirmed this is a part of the software that intentionally lowers peak cpu speeds in cold conditions. This specifically has been implemented on devices such as the iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, and recently the iPhone 7. In this video I share with you the information as to what is actually going on here and what you can do to check to see if your iPhone is slowing down. Any further questions, comments, concerns, feedback, please be sure to go ahead and leave it down below in the comment section of this video. As always, thank you for watching and be sure to be well and peace :)

Oh hannah
I wanna feel you close 
Oh hannah
Come lie with my bones
Oh hannah
don't look away
Oh hannah
Just look at me the same


I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath

Oh hannah
Tell me something nice
Like flowers and blue skies
Oh hannah
I will follow you home
Although my lips are blue and I'm cold

I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath

(Oh hannah •4)

I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna be your bitch
And I wanna touch you but not like this

The look in your eyes
My hand between your thighs
Oh this can't be real
It's all just a dream

I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna a kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath

Nostalgia Lyrics:
 
I remember the first time I was in love
It was all the way back in 1997
I stole my mama’s cell phone yes and I was turning it up
Tracked down your number boy I was so in love, I thought I was in heaven

It was so beautiful the love we had, the love we had
I can't believe we let it pass, we let it pass
So beautiful but you were right yes you were right we couldn’t last but what a blast we
Had

I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks
I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks

I remember the first time they caught us drinking
We were out there hanging on our bicycles glowing wheels
I had stole my dad’s liquor yeah and we were turning it up
High as a kite man we were so in love, so high above

So beautiful the love we had, the love we had
I can't believe we let it pass, we let it pass
So beautiful but you were right guess you were right we couldn’t last but what a blast we
Had

I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks
I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks

Come on grab my hand honey, don’t you wanna be wild with me?
Just like we used to be back then, oh, oh, oh, oh
Come and grab my hand honey, don’t you wanna dance with me
Just like we used to do so devoted to the music

I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks
I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks

I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks
I know you’re hurting, I know your heart it aches
For someone’s lovin’ ooh ooh but the sun shines when the cloud breaks

There's a petition out there to bring back George Lucas into the game, even if he can't own the IP ever again. If you have the heart to give George another chance at story telling, and i know it's almost impossible, well then sign it:

Marvel's Black Panther has made its theatrical debut, and moviegoers couldn't be more excited. As one of the MCU's few superheroes not played by a dude named Chris, the Black Panther is a powerful new addition to Marvel's roster of on-screen heroes, and he brings an entire country of awesome sci-fi tech and culture with him. But now that the credits have rolled and your vibranium suit is all out of energy, there's still something we gotta talk about: that ending. While the plot wrapped up without much in the way of loose ends, there are still plenty of questions we can ask about what it all means.  And of course... spoilers ahead.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Richard H - What are your thoughts of Moviepass' new $6.95 a month annual plan? And in your opinion should current  moviepass holders ""upgrade""?

Gordon Hann - I have been noticing when an actor has won or been nominated for a oscar award. In the marketing of the film they put ""oscar winner"" or 'oscar nominated"" about the actor. How come they do  not do this this with some actors  like tom cruise who has been nominated three times?

Jonathan Metal - Last night I was talking to my dad about how Disney is making a new Star Wars trilogy & it will be with new characters & my dad pretty much said he doesn't care cause it won't be with the characters he grew up with. A lot of Star Wars fans only know the main characters in the movies so if they were to make the movie based on KOTOR do you think it wouldn't do that great at the box office?

Bobs Najjar -  I hope you can understand why I'm a bit disappointed Justice League isn't going to do great at the box office. I'm now worried WB will shut down the DCEU because of lack of interest from the audience. My question is, what do you think is the reason more people went to see Thor, BvS and most other comic book movies over Justice League?

Natalie Miller - Hi John, watch your show almost every day! My question is regarding the massive difference between Justice League’s critic and audience ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Last I checked it was at 39% for critics and 86% for audience. Clearly fans are loving it but not critics. Why are the critics so out of touch with the fans on this movie?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CRMjxSSXs0A/hqdefault.jpg,0.0338681333728918,0.0024876189606773628,13.614678899082568,0.011502384919095329,0.036355752333569163,0.04785813725266449,2017-11-19,18:00:45,Sunday,6,13,17,13,17,78,153,2,40,0,0,11,12,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.067646121017869,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Think baseball is slow-paced or repetitive? These clips prove otherwise. From Nolan Ryan vs. Robin Ventura, to Tommy Lasorda vs. the Phillie Phanatic, to Jonathan Papelbon Attacking Bryce Harper, these meltdowns and fights are sometimes hilarious, sometimes terrifying. WatchMojo counts down ten baseball freakouts.

지난 18일 갑작스레 세상을 떠난 샤이니 종현(27·본명 김종현)의 발인식이 21일 엄수됐다. 
이날 오전 9시 서울 송파구 풍납동 서울아산병원 장례식장에서 열린 발인식은 소속사 관계자들과 유족 등이 참석한 가운데 진행됐다. 
많은 연예계 동료들이 발인에 참석해 고인의 마지막 길을 함께 했다. 
종현은 18일 오후 6시 10분께 서울 강남구 청담동의 한 레지던스에서 쓰러진 채 발견돼 인근 병원으로 옮겨졌으나 결국 사망 판정을 받았다.
1990년생인 그는 2005년 SM엔터테인먼트에 캐스팅돼 연습생 생활을 시작했으며 2008년 5월 25일 샤이니로 데뷔했다.
데뷔곡인 '누난 너무 예뻐'가 큰 사랑을 받으며 청춘스타로 발돋움했다.
샤이니 미니 2집의 타이틀곡 '줄리엣' 작사를 시작으로 자신의 솔로곡 대부분과 이하이의 '한숨' 등에 작사·작곡가로 참여해 음악적으로 성숙한 모습을 보였고, 지난해에는 제30회 골든디스크 어워즈에서 음반부문 본상을 받았다.

Parker wrote the lyrics to this song, and we put it to music! 

Lyrics:
A heart, 
Give them a heart,
draw them a heart with a pen,
but keep it in a hiding spot.
Or a hug,
people need hugs,
people want hugs,
something to hold on to.
A hug can really help a lot.
Love,
Give them your love,
Send them your love,
from your toy computer.
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
SO MUCH!
Time goes by very slow,
(or very fast)
but as long as you know they know
they can keep it in a hiding spot.
Love,
I need your love,
send me your love,
from your toy computer.
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you more
Never stop.

Whether you love them or hate them, there is no denying that the Kardashian family has built an empire at this point. It all started with Kim Kardashian becoming famous, which gave her other family members a ton of opportunities. But lately, it seems like her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, might just be stealing her spotlight. Sure, people made a big deal about Kim’s children, but baby Stormi seems to be much more popular. Both have launched their own cosmetics lines, but which one is more successful? One of the sisters is projected to become a billionaire by the year 2022, and who it is might just surprise you. We’ll discuss their houses, best friends, and their relationship timelines and see how these two famous sisters stack up against one another.

Join us in the Maldives again, but for an actual holiday this time! Alex and I needed some time away just the two of us, to finally have some alone time - so this was the perfect break away. This vlog contains an integrated paid for advertorial with and for the Google Pixelbook, which you guys have seen me use multiple times in previous vlogs! The beautiful, super thin design, makes this so perfect for on the go, so handy to take everywhere and we literally love it for holidays, writing notes, watching Netflix and also listening to music. Honestly, we’ve totally fallen in love with the Pixelbook now and couldn’t be more happy to share it with you guys! #ad #pixelbook @madebygoogle

--

From Clint Eastwood comes “The 15:17 to Paris,” which tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a highspeed railway ride.

In the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris—an attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.  The film follows the course of the friends’ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.

The heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (“Hall Pass,” TV’s “The Office”); Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes”); Ray Corasani (TV’s upcoming “The Long Road Home”); PJ Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”); Tony Hale (TV’s “Veep”); and Thomas Lennon (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”).  Paul-Mikél Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.

Eastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film’s executive producer is Bruce Berman.

Behind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood’s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood’s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut “Sully,” and that film’s composer, Christian Jacob.

Florida school shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez is the Internet’s voice of reason on gun control.

And if you haven’t heard what she has to say, listen up because it is pure truth.

Emma Gonzales, a high school senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, and a survivor of the recent shooting there, gave a powerful speech on gun control just days after the shooting. Her impassioned speech called out the US government for its inaction on the issue of gun violence, as she said QUOTE, “Every single person up here today, all these people should be home grieving, but instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see.”

At one point during the speech, Emma lead the crowd to exclaim, “We call BS” regarding many politicians’ lax stance on gun control, and it became a rallying cry for all who want stricter gun control laws.

Emma’s speech immediately went viral, and her words inspired people all over the country and on social media to bond over a commitment to change gun laws. Over the weekend, Emma and her peers announced a march on Washington, D.C. and the rest of the country, called “March For Our Lives”. The goal of the march will be to make sure politicians supported and funded by the NRA are NOT elected in the upcoming midterms.

Emma explained of the march’s goal QUOTE, “We don’t want these people in charge of us anymore...We have to be the politicians in this instance. We have to be the people calling for change and demanding a change.”

There aren’t enough microphones in the world for the number of mic drops this young woman deserves.

Emma received virtual standing ovations all over Twitter for her speech, with one user writing QUOTE, “I am more than old enough to be this kids' GrandFather and that was one of the finest, impassioned, speeches I have ever heard. By anyone of any age. Gives me some faith back in our youngest generation.” Another also praised Emma’s eloquent speech and promised that she won’t be alone in her fight for gun control, tweeting QUOTE, “Emma Gonzales is a hero. But don’t worry, there are millions more of us just as mad. And for the first time, we’re going to make our presence felt in November.”

For anyone who’s ever called the millennial generation lazy, be sure to watch what happens when “March For Our Lives” comes through your town.

And FYI, this is only the beginning…

We here at Clevver want to share our unwavering support for Emma Gonzalez and the “March for Our Lives” movement, as well as to express our sincerest condolences for the victims of the Florida school shooting. Thank you for joining me on News Feed, I’m your host Joslyn Davis and I’ll see you soon.

France Gall est décédée dimanche 7 janvier à l'âge de 70 ans des suites d'un cancer. Une perte qui a particulièrement affecté David Hallyday, déjà endeuillé par la mort de son père.

Le chanteur a tenu à lui rendre un émouvant hommage sur son compte Instagram. ""Quelle fin et début d’an­née diffi­cile !! Je ne repen­se­rai jamais assez à ces moments passés avec toi, France, cette belle rencontre artis­tique !! Quelle belle personne tu as été, nos conver­sa­tions sur la vie en géné­ral, sur la musique… merci ! Mes condo­léances à la famille, en vous souhai­tant beau­coup de courage et beau­coup d’amour !!!"", a-t-il écrit.

Sa mère, Sylvie Vartan, avait elle aussi fait part de son ""immense tristesse"" en apprenant la mort la chanteuse.  ""France Gall était une grande artiste.

=============================================

There is a reason people refer to the old days of YouTube as baby and cat videos. When they talk about Babies they are probably referring to Charlie Bit Me and when it comes to cats they are undoubtably speaking about Keyboard Cat, also I suppose Grumpy Cat but she didn't hit the web until 2013. The original Keyboard Cat recording dates back to 1984 but it wasn't until 2009 that the clip went viral ushering in one of the most popular meme crazes of all time. Keyboard Cat became a household name but they say – all Meme's must eventually die.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make my HATCHIMAL CAKE I started with my two cake favourites, Ultimate Chocolate and Ultimate Vanilla, filled them with Italian Meringue Buttercream,  and finished with fun, furry fondant, and a paint-splattered shell, making it as cute as its real-life inspiration.

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZh3ikcNlvA/sddefault.jpg,0.014565370102137869,0.00010878957609364609,133.88571428571427,0.0007086863814100372,0.014674159678231515,0.015382846059641552,2018-02-06,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,9,38,9,33,59,334,3,79,0,1,8,14,1,0,6.0,8.0,"['OW', 'perry', 'rT']","['OW', 'perry', 'rT']",True,"['OW', 'perri', 'rT']",3,3,9,0,1,0,0,6.532439102390812,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",3

Kim Zolciak is getting blasted by her ex lover DJ Tracy Young. They had a fling back in 2010 before she met Kroy. On Sunday’s RHOA reunion, Kim’s relationship with Tracy was brought up and Kim dismissed it. After the reunion, Tracy called Kim a “liar” and “homophobic.”

Plus, Cardi B announced last night that this weekend will be her last performance until she gives birth.

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

****** Nothing in this recipe needs to be exact !!!!!! ~  If you want to alter it slightly to meet your own preference that is just fine. This video is a combination of all of the other videos and recipes that I have tried in the past. I always slightly change recipes to my preference, thats the fun of cooking. Either way  I promise you, when you are done,  you will still get cheesecake. Don't over think anything :) and have fun.
*** Discloser ~ If you make more then three cheesecakes within a week, then you should probably share some with me :)

About INCREDIBLES 2: 
In “Incredibles 2,” Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack—whose superpowers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don’t shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That’s what makes this family so Incredible. 

Written and directed by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles,” “Ratatouille”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles,” “Tomorrowland”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), Disney•Pixar’s “Incredibles 2” busts into cinemas on July 13, 2018.

In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish swims up to 110 kilometers per hour. These feats are made possible by a fish’s form -- which in most species is a smooth, long body, fins, and a tail. Lauren Sallan explains why these features are so common, and what it reveals about fish.

This came after the U.S., France and the U.K. launched some 105 missiles on a chemical research this weekend on targets near the capital and Homs destroying three targets.


President Trump declared “Mission Accomplished” and described the strikes as“perfectly executed.” But Assad projected a business-as-usual veneer on social media, posting a nine-second video of himself walking through the presidential palace carrying a briefcase.

Analysts in the region say strikes like these could ultimately embolden the regime along with his Russian and Iranian allies rather than deter more attacks on civilians.
“Assad is in a much stronger situation than he was before,” Elias Farhat, a retired Lebanese general and Syria analyst said, “because he is, according to his people, is a hero who confronted the Israeli attack on the airfield and now American and European attack.”
But for the evacuees who lived in Eastern Ghouta and escaped this latest chemical attack in Douma, the US response seems meaningless.

“It's too late for that [US airstrikes],” Abu Hasan, a recently evacuated Douma resident told VICE News, “after all these deaths, including children...but we blame them [the USA]|for not taking timely action.”

If you’re fascinated by North Korea, but aren’t quite ready to venture there yourself, we don’t blame you! Fortunately, many brave souls have traveled there, and have managed to secretly take photos that are strictly against the rules in North Korea. Like every other aspect of life in North Korea, there are very strict laws about what can and what cannot be photographed, but every once in awhile someone manages to sneak a surreptitious photo that sheds light into what it’s like to live there. Some of these leaked images may be shocking, as they expose the poverty and living conditions that people who travel through North Korea witness. We’ll show you the squeaky clean streets of Pyongyang, as well as the less immaculately maintained parts of the city. These are some images that Kim Jong-un definitely would not want you to get your hands on.

The song incorporates smooth jazz and hip-hop beats while the lyrics address critical social and economic issues, two musical elements that are reminiscent of the group’s earlier days.

In a warm, personal talk, he shares his effort to reconcile who he is with who the world tells him a man should be. And he has a challenge for men: ""See if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper,"" he says. ""Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Are you strong enough to be sensitive? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?""

Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it’s a little more complicated: he’s yet to tell his family or friends he’s gay and he doesn’t actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing. Directed by Greg Berlanti (Dawson’s Creek, Brothers & Sisters), written by Isaac Aptaker & Elizabeth Berger (This is Us), and based on Becky Albertalli’s acclaimed novel, LOVE, SIMON is a funny and heartfelt coming-of-age story about the thrilling ride of finding yourself and falling in love.

Cast: Nick Robinson, Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg, Miles Heizer, Keiynan Lonsdale, Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, Tony Hale.

Directed by: Greg Berlanti

Screenplay by: Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger

Produced by: Wyck Godfrey and Marty Bowen

Rope Solo Free climbing is a sport that few people know about and even fewer people do. We hear from Pete Whittaker, his long time climbing partner Tom Randall and Big wall solo climbing expert Andy Kirkpatrick as they take us through the paces of what it really means to make a rope-solo-free ascent of El Cap. 

“The Problem is if Pete pulled it off, nobody would even get it, nobody would understand how hard it was""… ""and to do it in a day, is totally insane” - Andy Kirkpatrick 

“The ascent made by Pete on Freerider to me is hopefully the dawn of a new style of big wall solo climbing, big wall solo climbing on El Capitan for many years was just aid climbing. Now Pete has proven that it's possible to do that free climbing, but relatively fast” - Tom Randall

The Russian public showed mixed reactions to the decision; some said it was unfair, others simply did not care.

Day 19 of the Kardashian family Christmas card hit the web just yesterday, and fans think she’s covering up her growing belly with the help of her niece, Dream Kardashian!

That’s right! Rob Kardashian’s one-year-old daughter made an appearance in yesterday’s family photo, sitting in Khloe’s lap and conveniently blocking our view of her rumored pregnancy! Of course, this one photo instantly caused a social media frenzy, with fans quick to point out that she’s clearly hiding something. One fan on Twitter wrote, QUOTE, “holding dream cause she’s pregnant?!” with another adding, “Khloe hiding her bump with baby dream???? Where are Kendall… Kylie & Rob??” Hmm… good point! Where is Kylie?!

Anyways, even though we’d LOVE to believe that behind Dream in that photo is a pregnant Khloe, we’ll be honest, based on their day 13 and day 17 Christmas photos, we’re not so sure! In those particular photos, Khloe’s body was clearly visible, and no baby bump was in sight, so honestly, we don’t know what to believe anymore and we officially can’t keep up with the Kardashians!

Even though a baby may (or may not) be in the cards for Khlo-money in 2018, we can all rest assured because 2017 was actually one of the best years of her life! In a blog post on her app, she wrote, QUOTE, “Wow, 2017. I can honestly say this was one of the best years of my life. So many incredible things happened and lots of good memories I’m going to hang on to forever.” 

Here’s to hoping that one of those quote-unquote “INCREDIBLE THINGS” was finding out that she’s pregnant, because, just like all of you, we REALLY want to lay these Karjenner pregnancy rumors to rest and see some cute, new babies!

But what do you guys think? Is Khloe really hiding baby bump in the most recent Kardashian family Christmas card, or is she just, like, not expecting at all? What’s going on? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below, and then click to the left to find out all the info on Kylie choosing a baby name! Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr. and I’ll see you next time!

Red Cold River w/Lyrics

LYRICS:

Days reborn
Fight with folded hands
Pain left below
The lifeless live again

[Chorus]
Run, run, run
Red cold river
Run, run, run
Red cold river

I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

[Verse 2]
Stay reformed
Erase this perfect world
Hate left below
The dark stray dog of war

[Chorus]
Run, run, run
Red cold river
I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end
Run, run, run
Red cold river

[Bridge]
Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live

[Chorus]
I can't feel anything at all
(Try to find a reason to live)
This life has left me cold and damned
(Try to find a reason to live)
I can't feel anything at all
This love has let me to the end
Run, run, run
Red cold river

This is something we've always wanted to try but we thought we'd start at Disney Springs and then work our way up to actually pin trading in the parks. We went into several stores and spoke with so many awesome cast members while we looked for pin trading boards and areas. This was honestly so much fun! you don't need to spend a bunch of money to get started either. They were selling kits with starter pins and a lanyard in the pin trading store. We highly recommend trying it out, especially if you're looking for a fun family activity while you're in the theme park area. We can't wait to try out pin trading in the actual parks! Let us know if you've tried pin trading in the comments down below! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

I'm not sure how the back of the case is supposed to be attached, it came off quite easily and that may hint at a rough shipping experience.
Note that the LCD display just says 5V whatever the output voltage is, and it's just the current that changes.

If you want a set of the desoldering tubes then here's a general ebay com search link:-
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&LH_BIN=1&_nkw=hollow+desoldering+needles&_sop=15

Note that the rectifier on the secondary side appears to be an active rectifier type circuit that uses a dedicated chip and MOSFET to achieve rectification with very low voltage drop and heat.

Cabello had just sung with Kesha during an all-female performance of “Praying” that gave everyone goose bumps before she took the stage by herself to introduce U2. But not before seizing the moment to talk about a topic close to her heart. Dreamers. She started off by saying, QUOTE “Tonight in this room full of music’s dreamers we remember that this country was built by dreamers for dreamers chasing the American dream.” And then she got personal. 

Seriously, whip out the tissue people. There’s more.

The whole room bust out in applause for her, and she finished her speech off with, QUOTE “All I know is just like dreams, these kids can’t be forgotten and are worth fighting for.” Then she introduced U2’s politically charged performance of their song “Get Out Of Your Own Way” which U2 performed in front of the Statue of Liberty! Really driving the point home about the values of our democracy. But not before Camila recited Emma Lazarus’ famous poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty about “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…” She finished the poem giving way to the band’s unforgettable performance. Later on, U2 took aim at Trump’s infamous “s—hole” countries comment by sharing this pic of their performance with a very pro immigration caption. Definitely the most political moment of the night, but hard to argue with any of it. What did you guys think of Camila fighting for protection for Dreamers? Comment below, hit me up on on my socials because this is close to my heart too, @Miriamisa on Twitter, @Miriam_isa on Insta. But don’t put the tissue away- click here for Lady gaga’s tear jerker of a performance and her Times Up moment. I’m Miriam Isa. See you guys soon!

The Brazilian, who played 66 minutes, continues adapting to the Barça style with great players such as Iniesta, Suárez and Messi.

He has a special bond with the No.9 and No.10, not only on the football pitch but also personally. In fact, all three arrived together at the Stadium, in the same car; an image which opens the video showing how the Brazilian, the Uruguayan and the Argentinian prepared for a duel that ended with a Barça win. From the warm-up, walking out of the tunnel, in the dressing room and the delivery of the 'Player of the month’ award for December to Suárez, you won’t want to miss this!

NOTE: In saying ""Best Sushi in Japan"", I'm not saying this particular restaurant is the best sushi in Japan, but that the sushi journey, from Tsukiji fish auction, to the middle man who the best sushi chefs in the world get their tuna from (where we visited), to the omakase style of eating sushi - it's the entire process that's the best in the world of sushi.

We started off by going to the Tsukiji Fish Market tuna auction, that takes place early in the morning. The famous fish market is the biggest tuna auction in the world, and the best tuna that you get just about anywhere in the world for top end sushi restaurants comes through Tsukiji Market. We met up with Sushi Master Hiro Sato, who brought us around the market and took us to the Tuna King (Yamaguki), who is known for buying tuna and reselling on the best tuna to the best of the best of sushi restaurants in Tokyo.

It was fascinating to have an opportunity to visit Tsukiji Market for the fish auction, and to see the tuna being sliced in front of your eyes.

Sushi Arai (鮨 あらい) - For dinner, we had reservations a t one of the best restaurants in Tokyo for sushi, a restaurant called Sushi Arai. Our Best of Tokyo food tour had the entire 8 seater restaurant to ourselves, and it was pure joy to watch the chefs as they assembled each mini plate of food. Then it was time for sushi, and Chef Arai is a master, he literally just flies with his hands, gathering the fish in one hand and the ball of rice in the other, combining each bite with wasabi and molding them together. This was one of the best sushi experiences I’ve ever had in my life, and the quality, balance, and  perfection of the sushi, is next level.

Price - About 34,000 JPY ($300) per person

It was an amazing day of learning about the best sushi in Japan, both from the Tsukiji Market auction side, and the distribution of the tuna, all the way to eating at one of the top luxury sushi restaurants in Tokyo.

Thank you to The Hungry Tourist for inviting me on The Best of Tokyo Food Tour.
I didn’t personally pay for the food in this video.

What do you think?
I think Snoke is a descendant of someone, a greater power, someone who is of his species perhaps, but someone more powerful...who was the first force user before the first Jedi?
Has Luke Skywalker met him?
Will he in the next Star Wars movie?
Perhaps in the other films coming out?

Inductees Justin Hayward on vocals/guitar, John Lodge on bass/vocals and Graeme Edge on drums lead The Moody Blues live on HBO broadcast of the 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

The Moody Blues became eligible for Rock Hall induction in 1989. Astonishingly, their first nomination was in 2018 for the Performers category. Inducted members are Graeme Edge, Justin Hayward, Denny Laine (original guitarist on debut album), John Lodge, Mike Pinder, and the late Ray Thomas.

I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band) and Ride My See Saw were also performed during the induction ceremony. I'm Just a Singer is from the 1972 album Seventh Sojourn. Nights In White Satin is from the 1967 breakthrough album Days Of Future Passed. Ride My See-Saw is classic rock from 1968 In Search Of The Lost Chord.

In today's vlog we finally head back to Volcano Bay, Universal Orlando's water theme park. It was so nice to be back! There were some new updates and we even had some new tips for you guys! We had an awesome day with minimal waits and very low crowd levels. This is a great time to go but the weather is quite unpredictable so keep that in mind when vacation planning. Things can definitely change from year to year as far as the weather goes. We were able to ride everything but we weren't able to take the GoPro on the slides anymore so I think they've definitely settled on the no camera on slides policy which is a bummer but is also understandable. You can however still take them in the rivers and wave pool! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

This vid was uploaded for like three minutes without ""Career High"" in the title, because I assumed that he scored 30 at some point. I swear I made a vid of him scoring that money, but I guess not, because this is the most he's ever scored in an NBA game.

I rely on the commentators to let me know when stuff like this happens. Normally I have a good memory for it, but I'm not perfect, and it's up to the guys at the mics to get really excited a player sets a new high-water mark. Even if their team is losing, even if they just watched their star player go down with an exploded knee. It's part of the contract they have with the fans, and that contract was broken tonight.

It's possible that they mentioned it after the fact, but am I going to sit there and watch the game so that I can maybe hear something like that? No. My time is precious. Each wasted minute means another scrub who doesn't get a video.

Big props to Bazemore for scoring 29 tonight. It's not his fault that the commentators didn't care. He took it to his old buddy Stephen Curry. Took it right at him, even hit a fadeaway in his face. I'd even go so far as to call this a ""revenge game"" against the Warriors. People don't really remember his time on that squad except for his towel-waving abilities, and for good reason. I definitely made some vids of him from that era, which are gone now, and it's remarkable how much he's improved. More props to him.

Your favorite athlete closes in for a win; the crowd holds its breath, and at the crucial moment ... she misses the shot. That competitor just experienced the phenomenon known as “choking,” where despite months, even years, of practice, a person fails right when it matters most. Why does this happen, and what can we do to avoid it? Noa Kageyama and Pen-Pen Chen explain why we choke under pressure.

Lesson by Noa Kageyama and Pen-Pen Chen, animation by Olesya Shchukina.

What makes a movie so good it’s bad? Well I think I should start by saying the mythical movie that is utterly dreadful but entirely enjoyable is really a very rare beast.

There are hundreds of movies that are ‘so bad they’re good’ but I’d argue that these are mostly just terrible movies.

In 2001, Musk conceptualized ""Mars Oasis""; a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration. In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8 million, however, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that theoretically, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin. Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a ""true spacefaring civilization"".
Musk and President Barack Obama at the Falcon 9 launch site in 2010

With US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002. Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company. SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).

And there are four porcelain cow ribs attached to the left side of the body.

Made of plastic and porcelain, the instrument was the result of a collaboration between a musician, a mechanical engineer, and a sculptor at the University of Texas at Austin. It took them a year, and the design is intended to eventually be modified by other users.

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Give me little something to remember (Cardi!)

Quick to drop a nigga like Kimbo (go)
Lookin' like a right swipe on Tinder (woo)
Shit on these hoes (shit)
Light up my wrist on these hoes (wrist)
Now I look down on these bitches (down)
I feel like I'm on stilts on these hoes (woo)
Fuck ya' baby daddy right now (right now)
Anna Mae, got cake by the pound (pound)
Go down, eat it up, don't drown
Mac n' cheese in the bowl, how it sound? (sound)

Yeah that's a fact, but I never been pussy
I've been that bitch since pajamas with footies
Won MVP, and I'm still a rookie, like woo
I gotta work on my anger (ayy)
Might kill a bitch with my fingers (ayy)
I gotta stay outta Gucci (woo)
I'm finna run outta hangers (woo)
Is she a stripper, a rapper or a singer?
I'm busting racks in a Bentley Bentayga
Ride through your hood like ""Bitch, I'm the mayor!""
You not my bitch, then bitch you are done

[Chorus: Cardi B & Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)

[Refrain: Offset]
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)

Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga (nothin')
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga (brrt)
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga (fuck 'em)
Got a gang full of dud and some broke niggas (dud)
Diamonds on me, what's the price? (price)
I'm not gettin' involved with the hype (hype)
I'm too rich to get into a fight (too rich)
50 racks got my jeans fittin' tight (50 racks)
Pay the price and them boys come and wipe ya' (wipe ya')
We had to dispose of the diaper (dispose)
Yeah we trap every week, every night (woah)
Word my move, we too smooth, no indictments (hey)
Yeah, freakazoid lightning (lightning)

When I got a mil I got excited (million)
For the cash I'ma turn to Michael Myers
Baguettes keep dripping, dropping (drip)
My wrist all liquid watches (watch)
Told the bitch ""Jump on my dick and pop it"" (yeah)
Get a little bitch a deposit (hey, brrt)

Have you ever wished that you could be a member of the royal family, or at least wear fabulous clothes like they do? You might just change your mind about all of that when you learn that they have some pretty strict rules about what to wear. Even Queen Elizabeth herself isn’t exempt from these clothing related restrictions! We’ll let you know why Meghan Markle isn’t allowed to wear a tiara, but Kate Middleton is. And you’ll learn the one strange accessory that all royal women are required to wear when they are out in public. Wearing gloves might look fancy, but they also serve a very practical purpose for royal family members. Do you think that you could abide by these rules? If so, be sure to leave us a comment below, and hit the subscribe button to get the latest videos from TheTalko.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

In the world of filmmaking, we often imagine everything as being perfectly planned, rehearsed, choreographed, and perfect. But as most of us should know, there is no such things as perfection. Filmmakers are well acquainted with Murphy’s Law, which basically states that what can go wrong will go wrong. But hey, that’s life. Things don’t always go as planned. Not even in the seemingly perfect world of movie magic. It doesn’t matter how much you rehearse something, things can always take a turn for the worst. And sometimes mistakes can turn out to be a good thing and make scenes in films a lot better. These mistakes, or enhancements, are sometimes left in the final cuts of the films. Such is the case for several movies that we will be discussing today.
In Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord tries to hand over the orb that unbeknownst to him contains an Infinity Stone. But he ends up dropping it and without missing a beat grabs it and continues to hand it over to the Collector. This drop was a total mistake but it fits Star Lord’s dorky personality don’t you think? 
Did you know that the scene where Aragorn kicks a helmet and drops down screaming in agony was a mistake? No it wasn’t just the anguish of thinking Merry and Pippin were dead, Viggo Mortensen actually broke his toes when he did that take.

In his first video release since ""Despacito"" rocketed to global acclaim, the Latin star connects with Demi Lovato for what he calls a ""happy breakup song.""  Director Carlos Pérez says he was going for a ""bright hypercolor piece"" that allowed room for some ""chaotic dancing"" and flat-out fun. Vevo's Anupa Mistry chatted with both the singer and the director. Get the inside scoop on the shoot in 'Footnotes.'

[앵커] 
어제 오후 판문점 공동경비구역 JSA로 귀순한 북한군 병사는 지프를 타고 판문점 건너편에 있는 북한 쪽 건물까지 접근해서 귀순해 온 것으로 확인되고 있습니다.

김용현 동국대 북한학과 교수, 김정아 전 인민군 장교 두 분 모셨습니다. 안녕하십니까?

[인터뷰] 
안녕하십니까. 

[앵커] 
오늘 귀순 당시 상황과 관련해 합참에서 자세히 발표를 했는데요. 발표 내용을 우선 좀 들어보시겠습니다.

[서욱 / 합참 작전본부장 : 15시 14분에 판문각 남쪽에 도로가 있는데 도로의 동에서 서로 4초소 방향으로 이동하는 북한군 3명을 관측했습니다. 그로부터 1분 후에 북한군 1명이 차량, 지프로 돌진해 하차한 다음에 MDL 남쪽으로 도주하는 것을 식별했고 저희는 40여 발정도 사격한 것으로 판단하고 있습니다. 15시 31분에는 TOD 화면을 보고 식별한 다음 JSA 대대는 즉각 전투 배치하고 그 지역 담당하는 1군단, 3야전군 등에서 필요한 대비태세 격상해서 조치했습니다. 15시 56분에는 간부 3명이 포복으로 접근해 귀순자를 안전지역, 즉 자유의집 후방으로 끌어낸 다음 후송하게 됩니다. 16시 04분에는 귀순자가 보나파스 헬기장까지 도착을 완료하였고, 16시 23분에 UN사 UH60 헬기를 이용해 후송을 개시해 16시 45분에 수원 아주대병원에 도착하였습니다.]

[앵커] 
3시 14분부터 1시간가량 귀순에서 후송까지 아주 긴박했던 상황을 잘 설명해 주었는데 저희가 그래픽을 준비를 해 봤습니다. 판문점을 둘러싼 넓은 지역이 JSA, 공동경비구역 아니겠습니까? 판문점에서 사실 발생한 사건인데요. 당시 상황을 다시 한 번 정리를 해 주실까요?

[인터뷰] 
우선은 북측에서... 

[앵커] 
군사분계선을 기준으로 판문각이 있고 통일각이 있죠. 우리 쪽으로는 자유의 집이 있고 평화의 집이 있고 가운데에 판문점이 쭉 있는 거잖아요.

[인터뷰] 
군사분계선 중간에 20cm 정도의 턱으로 돼 있는 군사분계선이 중앙이 있죠. 그래서 북측에서 북한 군 한 명이 지프차를 타고 급히 오다가 통일각 앞에 그쪽에서 멈춰 선 것으로 지금 되어 있고. 거기에서부터 뛰어오는 그런 과정인데. 거기에서 총격이 있었다는 것이고 그 총격이 실제 군사분계선 넘은 뒤에도 총격이 있었느냐, 아니면 그 전에 총격이 끝나고 북한군 병사는 쓰러진 상태에서 그렇게 우... (중략)

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. 

While her song ""Devil Devil"" hit success, it wasn't until her anthem ""Quiet"" made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. 

With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D09bZL7F1y4/sddefault.jpg,0.01755666805729384,0.00024335975524961758,72.14285714285714,0.00048671951049923516,0.017800027812543456,0.018286747323042692,2018-01-19,05:03:43,Friday,4,5,35,5,32,35,248,3,45,1,1,3,9,0,6,6.0,6.0,"['RIOT Ti', '', 'Ic', 'OAD INU', '', 'THIS,']","['RIOT', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'OAD', 'INU', 'THIS,']",True,"['riot', 'Ti', 'Ic', 'oad', 'inu', 'thi', ',']",7,7,18,1,0,2,0,6.2043957208298295,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

The 2018 storm chasing season has been a tough one...long days with not much reward. But May 1st, was a different story. The day held a lot of promise for tornado potential, but I'm a photographer at heart and I was mostly hoping for some really good supercell structure when it had been challenging to find. We began the day near Russell, Kansas...and saw a nice storm fire up, then dropped south to another one west of Hoisington. This supercell was amazing, structure stunning. We kept up with it for awhile, but it seemed like maybe it would get ruined by a left split that collided with it. We almost dropped south, but changed our minds thanks to a phone call with my buddy James Langford who reminded me of some forecasting we had done in the morning. We caught back up with the storm near I-70 and raced ahead to Culver City where we'd get a nice view of the supercell structure for a bit before it got close.

But as we sat there...tornado sirens went off in town (which is what you hear at the start of the video). We noticed a wall cloud forming...and then a cone tornado dropped right before our eyes. I couldn't believe my luck with time-lapsing it before it ever started. And then the tornado disappeared into the rain, only to come back out as a full wedge tornado that was later rated EF3. Watching it sping across the horizon was a moment I wont soon forget. 

Luckily no one was hurt or killed, despite some destroyed structures. Very thankful for that...especially for one of this scale which was about a half-mile wide. We watched from Culver City, but the tornado passed very close to Tescott but far enough away to not cause major devastation.

It was an amazing moment, I somehow was lucky enough to capture the entire tornado lifecycle, from wall cloud, to cone, to wedge and then fading into rain where I believe it did die out at some point.

Best tornado footage I've captured on time-lapse  and it's the highlight of the spring so far!

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

As Jordan McCabe finishes up his senior year, Overtime had to head out to Kaukauna, Wisconsin to check him out. We hung out with Jordan for a few days and learned all about his workouts, his family and how he COOKS!? The West Virginia commit is one of the hardest workers we've seen but also just a dope person. 

Gameday is a series where we head to where top players will be playing to meet up with them, their family and their school to see what it's like to be THE GUY. We've also hung out with Jalen Lecque, Shareef and Cassius and Mac McClung! Make sure to peep those on our page.

In my new shop, I hadn't properly set up my dust collection system. With this blank slate, I had an opportunity to improve on my older automated system that worked off a key pad. I wanted the ability to simply turn on a tool and the dust collector would fire up and all the blast gates to close like they should.
In a shop with many tools, there are valves that can isolate the suction to help improve air flow, the more tools you have, the more gates you would have to close in order to use one tool. With the help of an Arduino micro controller, I was hoping to automatically control these gates and have the DC turn on and off with the tool.

There are commercially available systems that do this, but they are expensive and don't offer a way to add additional IoT functions later. Eventually, I'm hoping to connect the system to other sensors set up around the room to make the ultimate workshop of the future!

I started by laying out the pipes that would connect the DC to each tool in the most efficient way. I found some drainage piping at Lowe's which was much cheaper than traditional PVC pipe. Because the walls of this drainage pipe were thinner than regular PVC, most of the blast gates and fittings wouldn't connect.  Josh designed and 3d printed a bunch of adapters to connect the whole system together. After connecting all of the tools to the pipes and fittings, we played it safe and added a ground wire from one of the pipes to an existing ground wire in the basement. This is said to prevent static buildup which could be dangerous in a dusty environment, so I added it just in case.

With the ducting in place, I focused on the sensors that would read the amperage spike when each tool is turned on.  I made a housing that the tools would plug into to receive power and also connect to the voltage detector that connects to the Arduino. Once you turn on a tool, an amperage spike is detected and an input signal tells the Arduino to shuttle the appropriate blast gates and to trip the relay that controls the DC. The blast gates are controlled by a servo mounted on a bracket that swings an arm connected to the gate. When the servo moves, the arm pushes or pulls the gate open or closed.

There are a lot of components to this system so managing all of the wires, plugs, connectors, and servos was very important. All of the connecters were pinned and protected with heat shrink, all of the wires were bundled and labeled, and the servos were dialed in to make sure the gates weren't hitting any hard stops.

The system works great except for one component that kept giving us trouble. The 15 amp relay that was controlling the dust collector would fail after a few days. After some research, I discovered that they were a bit underpowered for the 2 horsepower DC. I have ordered a beefier relay and when we get it hooked up and working, it'll be listed here. If you want the Arduino code for I made for this project, you can find it here.

I hope this project inspires you streamline your workflow and find ways to improve efficiency in your shop or home.

The 60th annual Grammy awards are underway and the award for Best New Artist – which is arguably the most coveted award given out at the Grammy Awards – since musicians can only be nominated once and you can only win it once.

The category was stacked with so many talented nominees including Julia Michaels, SZA, Khalid, and Lil Uzi Vert. But Alessia Cara ending up beating them all and was in complete shock when her name was called. This is Alessia’s first year at the Grammy BY THE WAY and she’s nominated for 3 more: Song of The Year, Best Short Form Music Video, and Best Pop Duo/ Group Performance.

Once Alessia’s name was called she went of the stage to accept the award and even though she’s dreamed of winning a Grammy her whole life, she didn’t have a speech planned. But she did manage to thank every one in her life and say this.

Alessia ended her speech by encouraging everyone to “support real music and real artists” since some artists never have the chance to get recognized.

I’m very happy for Alessia and as much as I love Khalid and Sza, I actually think this is very well-deserved. However, what is weird about Alessia winning in this category is that her first debut album aka the one that put her on the map, was released in November of 2015 which means she should have been eligible and nominated for Best New Artist at the 2017 Grammys. But at last year’s Grammys she wasn’t nominated for anything and the Academy never addressed it, but now since she’s won this year, there may be some questions now about the controversy.

But I gotta kick it over to you guys now. What are your thoughts on Alessia Cara winning Best New Artist at this year’s Grammys? Do you think it’s well-deserved or do you think someone else in the category should have took the trophy? Thank so much for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Naz Perez and I’ll see you guys in another video tonight!

It is the second “A Star Wars Story” film and the first to specifically focus on an Original Trilogy character in the title. The film is an adventure into a dark criminal underworld, where Han Solo meets his future copilot Chewbacca and encounters Lando Calrissian years before joining the Rebellion. THR is now reporting that Lucasfilm and Disney are possibly having internal discussions about releasing only one Star Wars film a year as a result of the Solo reaction at the box office. The report says that they are looking at focusing on releasing their annual Star Wars film in December.

Mark Reilly and John Rocha sit down to explore this news and offer their thoughts on the possibility of this decision being made by Disney and Lucasfilm. They offer their thoughts on why they think ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ didn’t work and if this decision reeks of desperation or an overreaction to course correct. Let us know what you think the film might do in the COMMENTS section below. Remember to LIKE and SHARE this video on your social media and to Subscribe to our channel.

Kendall and Kylie Jenner have their followers, but they've also got a whole lot of haters. Perhaps it's simply par for the course because they're rich, beautiful, and famous. However, some of the vitriol directed at these ""Satellite Kardashians"" is the fault of their own pettiness and penchant for drama. Here are the stars who just can't stand the Jenner sisters...

‘Twas a few nights before Christmas and all through the street,
Not a creature was stirring except this piano geek;
The lights were all hung on the houses with care,
In hopes that Jon wouldn’t play piano there;

The people were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of cello music danced in their heads;
And Paul in his t-shirt and Al in his boots
Had just settled down for an all night video shoot.

When out in the street arose such a clatter,
People sprang from their beds to see what was the matter
Out the windows they watched, their phones they unlocked
Was this a dream or should they call the cops?

Jon sprang from his bench, running fast as he could,
As the neighborhood dogs barked (just as they should);
But we heard him exclaim, ere he ran out of sight,
HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!

FUN FACTS ABOUT THIS VIDEO:

This was really filmed in the middle of the night, as you may have guessed.

Today, as the second episode of our Olympics Series, we go ice fishing in Pyeongchang! Who would have thought, we would go ice fishing in PyeongChang at -20 degrees?! It was our first time trying ice fishing, and it was epic! We even got to grill the fish in a stove and eat it straight away! I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as we enjoyed filming it! :)
We will also release our next episode tomorrow during the livestream at 8pm! So make sure you guys stay tuned for that as well!!

Including some of the biggest hits of the year and a special part at the end  
This year has been a bit different for me about mashups, after my third channel got deleted last year I wasn’t motivated to keep making mashups but then I remembered that it’s something that I like, it’s a hobby and that I’m not doing this just for views so I decided to create a new one.
This year I started great with my channel, but I started to be busier with the school, then after Chester’s death I was very sad and it was like I wasn’t  really interested in the music releases, his death was really one of the worst things of the year.
2 months ago I started with the idea of a year-end but I wasn’t very updated with the music, so I thought that I wouldn’t be uploading one this year but after watching some mashups and megamixes I got inspired and finally decided to make one, in my opinion this year’s music was really bad but hopefully next year will be better.
Hope you like this! Can’t wait for next year! :)

If you compare gasoline and diesel models of the same vehicle, the diesel engine tends to have far more torque. Why is this? In this video we'll discuss the major differences between diesel and gasoline engines, that result in the diesel engine producing significantly more torque. 

From the compression ratio, the speed of combustion, the bore vs stroke ratio, the use of turbocharging, and the energy density of diesel, there are many logical reasons why it's chosen for high torque applications.

John discusses the following topics:

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Jay Pinkston - My question is about the future of streaming. Movie studios used to own their own theaters until the government said studios had to divest from theaters. Do you think this could happen with streaming? An argument could be made that it’s unfair for the small studios to compete with the giants that have their own streaming service.

Jeremy Madreen - Just wondering if you had a chance to see that new Nic Cage trailer called Mom And Dad. Looks like low budget craziness. I thought it was great. Thoughts?

Sean Liu - Hi John, You mentioned several times that Netflix is the Goliath in the streaming business and Disney/Fox is the David.  If this is true, why did Disney pay 60+ billion to buy Fox instead of just paying a similar price (if not cheaper) to buy Netflix instead?

Linus Knight - Looks like the (Russian/overseas?) poster for “Solo” has been released/leaked online! it looks like things are better than originally feared. Do you think a trailer will be following soon?

Daniel Yamasaki - Hey John! Do you think that Captain America or anyone from Captain America's team will make some sort of appearance in Black Panther since it's the last movie before Infinity War? Thanks and keep up the awesome work!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6_FXQbdojU/hqdefault.jpg,0.03535793858374504,0.0018082598727760016,19.553571428571427,0.006619522748555006,0.03716619845652104,0.04378572120507605,2017-12-28,17:45:29,Thursday,3,15,17,15,17,83,133,3,34,0,2,14,16,4,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.27219901780096,2,"['scared', 'happy']",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D7VFi91c0WA/sddefault.jpg,0.007587168311754903,0.0001762594539161646,43.04545454545455,0.0004486604281502371,0.007763427765671069,0.008212088193821306,2018-02-22,09:35:00,Thursday,3,7,44,7,39,47,411,0,94,0,1,7,20,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.304256852285062,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Lyrics: 

Thought I would be better
off all on my own
thought that was what I wanted
now, I just want you home

Yeah I know I should've loved you, baby
back when you were mine
Yeah I let you go and now I know 
I need you like crazy 
I guess the grass ain't greener on the other side
I guess the grass ain't greener on the other side

what if I come back over?
would you let me in? 
I know I don't deserve you 
but I swear I can be a better man 

Yeah I know I should've loved you, baby
back when you were mine
Yeah I let you go and now I know 
I need you like crazy 
I guess the grass ain't greener on the other side
I guess the grass ain't greener on the other side

The studio helps to provide the tools, the space and the inspiration needed to grow into professional, exhibited artists. Today, artists represented by Creative Growth have been invited to the Venice Biennale, have had their works acquired by MoMA, and remain in high demand among collectors around the world.

On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Friday, March 9th, 2018) Mark Reilly, Perri Nemiroff, Dennis Tzeng, and John Rocha discuss the following:

1) ‘Avengers: Infinity War’s Wakanda Connection Plays into the Fight against Thanos + new images and EW covers released

2) 'Terminator' Reboot Taps Mackenzie Davis to Star

3) David Chase Sets ‘The Sopranos’ Prequel Movie ‘The Many Saints of Newark’

4) Danny Boyle apparently confirmed to direct Bond 25 after his All You Need Is Love movie

5) Rob Liefeld’s ‘Extreme Universe’ Heads to Netflix

6) Live Twitter Questions

As part of a long write-up from EW, we’ve learned a lot about the setting of Wakanda and what role it will play in Avengers Infinity War. It looks as though the reason Thanos and some of his Black Order soldiers have descended upon the hidden nation is actually to claim one of the legendary Infinity Stones. Nope, not the Soul Stone - it’s the Mind Stone that’s currently giving Vision all power and the only way to help keep him safe is to hide him out in Wakanda.

Variety reports that 'Blade Runner 2049' actress Mackenzie Davis is in negotiations to join Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the latest Terminator movie, directed by Tim Miller, with James Cameron also involved. Davis is said to be up for the role of a soldier-assassin on a mission.

Deadline reports that David Chase is teaming up with New Line Cinema for the feature film The Many Saints of Newark, which will be a prequel to the popular, long running HBO series The Sopranos. Chase penned the script with Lawrence Konner, a Sopranos alum, and the story takes place in the era of the Newark riots in the 1960s.

Will he or won’t he? That seems to be the question around these parts after reading a report via ScreenCrush, from The Daily Mail that has their reporter saying: Danny Boyle will direct next 007 film Bond 25 late this year after shooting AllYouNeedIsLove.

According to Deadline, Netflix is going to attempt their own brand of shared universe pics by making a seven-figure rights deal with Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld’s Extreme Universe series of comics and tapping Akiva Goldsman to set up and oversee a high-end writers’ room.

The best part about it is that you can switch up the dry spice that gets dusted on the scallop for different varieties of seasoned crispiness.

Here are some excerpts of Survival Research Laboratories performance at the opening at Marlborough Contemporary in Chelsea, New York on 1/6/2018.
Mark Pauline

Includes The Pitching Machine

The exhibit runs from Jan 06 — Feb 10  in New York.

The exhibition, the first solo presentation by SRL in a commercial gallery, comprises eight kinetic sculptures dating from 1986 to the present, along with video documentation of past performances in which these machines were engaged. 

 

Arising from San Francisco’s emergent technological revolution in the late 1970’s, SRL—an amorphous crew of indeterminate number led by the visionary Mark Pauline—can be seen to represent a robust counterpoint to the convenience app and frictionless capitalism that Silicon Valley has enabled. While the tech sector has naturally moved toward smaller, faster and cleaner Pauline has maintained a visceral, humanized vision of machines. His robots are built from raw and battered steel and lurch, shudder and smash rather than gliding effortlessly. They are inefficient and fallible, and sacrifice themselves as readily as they destroy. 

 

Historically, the machines have been made from purloined and available materials (“Obtanium” in SRL parlance) beginning with simple bottling automation mechanics from a defunct brewery and extending to Oculus Rift. The Spine Robot, a trunk-like appendage with a claw and whose hyper-articulated movement is enabled by of-the-moment carbon fiber cable, is operated remotely and can grasp objects with a surprising delicacy. 

 

Other works eschew technological nitpicking for sheer displays of power. The Pitching Machine, for example, employs a 500 cubic-inch Cadillac Eldorado engine, linked to a sequence of spinning tires, that is capable of hurling a standard two-by-four at speeds up to 200 miles per hour. Violence and danger are materials in Pauline’s work, and fear is often a reasonable response. The artist and viewer collectively amplifying and refracting the American Way. 

 

Already a hero in the global counterculture, and an inspiration to generations of influential thinkers from William Gibson to WIRED Magazine, Mark Pauline has been historically less visible within the art world. This exhibition aims to emphasize the raw power and beauty of the sculptures as objects that we can now safely inspect. Here, their intricate, complex construction and menacing design is temporarily in repose, while daring to dream of roaming a respectable sculpture park near you. 

 

Survival Research Laboratories was conceived of and founded by Mark Pauline in November 1978. Since its inception SRL has operated as an organization of creative technicians dedicated to re-directing the techniques, tools, and tenets of industry, science, and the military away from their typical manifestations in practicality, product or warfare. Since 1979, SRL has staged over 55 mechanized presentations in the United States, Europe and Asia. Each performance consists of a unique set of ritualized interactions between machines, robots, and special effects devices, employed in developing themes of socio-political satire. Humans are present only as audience or operators.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DCb0x9_ORQw/sddefault.jpg,0.007240276140764439,0.00016837851490149856,43.0,0.0003367570298029971,0.007408654655665937,0.007745411685468934,2018-01-18,03:18:48,Thursday,3,8,26,8,26,61,231,3,44,0,2,5,18,1,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.572345541049062,2,"['angry', 'happy']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 11},11

Camila Cabello being nominated alongside the One Direction crew is interesting too, because not too long ago she hinted at there being some behind the scenes hostility that went on within the group. So this could get interesting.

About You (feat. blackbear) | Lyrics

This is that gather round it / and wonder where I found it
This is that wake up make your agent have your tour re-routed
This is that drama comma pain and ain’t no way around it
Cause somehow still it's hard to know what I can say about it
I buckled up told myself to suck it up 
I was scared to death to get up there and spill my fucking guts
I was saying pull your stupid self together buttercup
get it cracking Back in Black until you have em Thunderstruck 
But

Even when it's not about you, about you
All the sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All the sudden it's about you

No, there's not a single thing that I can say
Not a single solitary / every meaning changes shape
Even when there's no connection back to you in any line
All the sudden it's about you and it gets me every time but
What the fuck is left to author anyway
When I basically been writing since the Raiders ran LA
I’m afraid that maybe I've said everything there is to say
Maybe I should make an exit while there’re ways to get away, cause

(blackbear)
can’t find the words to a memory
but these are just words to a melody
find something that works fits the symmetry
for only a quick broken remedy
and i’d give anything to choose
pick out the words i bring home to u
how can i make due
put a smile on change my attitude
and even though it’s not about u
everything is all about u 
all about u",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFIg6mi49Ig/sddefault.jpg,0.0294591788424582,0.00040292689078107007,73.11296296296297,0.0017072161594575714,0.029862105733239268,0.03156932189269684,2018-04-26,16:00:03,Thursday,3,9,9,9,9,59,78,6,16,0,0,6,6,2,1,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.419932055448268,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Is Skills Park in Zurich the best skatepark ever? I think it is, its so much fun and super unique with the airbag jump, perfect for MTB!

It still blows my mind that a place exists with such a huge airbag jump built into the skatepark. To get speed for it you have to drop in from the second floor its seriously sick!

So i was over in Zurich with my protection sponsor TSG, and we were doing a video shoot inside the Skills Park and when I was elevated from filming duty i was abe to ride this incredible place. 

Unfortunately my friend Chris Raeber was injured but that meant i had a fire for the day and he decided to call the shots for me and i ended up doing some new tricks!!

Shot on GoPro HERO 6 Black.

ENJOY!!

When you are a celebrity, people spread lies about you all the time. That’s not out of the usual at all. What is weird though is when those lies have some truth to them. Here are 10 Lies About Kylie Jenner That Turned Out To Be True.

People have been saying that Kylie has been pregnant for a long time. Pretty much throughout her whole relationship with Tyga, people kept speculating that she was expecting a child. Well now that she is with Travis Scott, Kylie actually is pregnant! Thought it’s no like she would admit that herself.

Kylie’s lips have also been a topic of conversation for years. When they became plumper from one day to the next, people wondered if Kylie had gotten lip injections. She claimed that she hadn’t. She said that she had only overlined her lips. But, we are going to be taking a look at the truth behind her plumped up lips, and you’ll have to watch the video to see.

When rumors started flying around that Kylie, who was underage at the time, was dating Tyga, the two denied it. That was until the “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star turned 18. Once she was of legal age, the two came clean with their relationship and proved we had been right all along!

Whether it’s her numerous boyfriends, breakups, or the status of her show, there is a lot that you don’t know about Kylie! Stay tuned to 10 Lies About Kylie Jenner That Turned Out To Be True to find out which lie the Kardashians don’t want you to know is absolutely true!

Movies are the most common pastime and form of entertainment. They take an incredible amount of time to make. From story developing, to casting talent and crew, to filming, and creating magic, and post production. It is all a work of art. But making audiences believe the world, especially the characters are real is a where the magic really happens. Especially with the actors. There have been some incredible performances throughout history. But what if we told you some of these performances were really being experienced and the actors weren’t acting? Today we will be discussing real moments where actors weren’t acting.
Such as Drew Barrymore in E.T. She was told that E.T. was actually real. The first time she sees E.T. and freaks out is a very real moment as she had never seen the puppet before. Also, when she cries when E.T. dies is a real moment as she thought the alien was real.
In Fight Club, Ed Norton’s character was told to hit Brad Pitt on the shoulder during their first fight. But was told last minute to hit him in the ear, unbeknownst to Brad. Which made his reaction very amusing and very real.
One of the funniest scenes that really happened was the waxing scene in the 40 year old virgin. Steve Carrel’s screams and phrases are all genuine reactions to being waxed in real life.
