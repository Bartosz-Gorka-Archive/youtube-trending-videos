When they met in 1993, they were “sort of in the closet.” John’s wife of over 35 years had died nearly a decade prior and he had never been in a serious relationship with a man. Neither had Jerry.

1)    Why is it that Jessica Chastain never receives the recognition that she deserves? Thank you for taking my question.

2)    Why don’t studios like Paramount go back to basics? Why does every film have to be a franchise film?

3)    Which MCU films should a casual fan absolutely need to watch before seeing Infinity War? 

4)    I’ll keep it simple - this Netflix/God Particle acquisition news … good? bad? Is this the end of the Cloverfield films?

5)    Is there any possibility for the Scream franchise to make a return with Scream 5? Is there any possibility we can get a new movie in a near future?

I created this as a harmonic study to understand how the voice leading in this song works (as well as to learn some spicy voicings of course)! I really hope you find it useful or entertaining, and be sure to let me know if you did by liking/sharing this video :) 

*Some of the chord names may be incorrect as they were generated from the keyboard output.

The process of creating this took 74 hours in total. I transcribed the song by ear and inputting midi notes for each phrase. After the base-transcription was complete, I went back through the piano roll and assigned each note a different channel (e.g 4 notes in a chord would have 4 different channels). I then imported the midi track into MAM and recorded that, as well as the output from midiChordAnalyser to form the visual display. From there, it was a simple task of editing it together!

Stories of a child raised in Akron’s inner-city on his quest for greatness are told by pivotal figures who experienced it first-hand. Key figures include LeBron’s business partner and UNINTERRUPTED CEO Maverick Carter, LeBron’s former St. Vincent-St. Mary H.S. coach Keith Dambrot, Nike executive Lynn Merritt who signed LeBron, Kith-founder Ronnie Fieg, and LeBron James himself.

They reported that for the week of May 6-12, Cobra Kai outperformed Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why’ and ‘Arrested Development’ and Hulu’s ‘The Handmaid’s Tale.’
It’s the first time that a YouTube Red show has topped the streaming competition. It reached its peak on May 7th when it had more than 54% demand than ‘13 Reasons Why’, more than twice the demand for ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’; and a whopping 121% more demand than Netflix’s ‘Lost in Space.’ The show is set thirty years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, the series focuses on Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) reopening the Cobra Kai dojo, which causes his rivalry with Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) to be reignited.

Laserdisc seems to get a lot of retro cred these days.  It gets featured as a technical oddity, but from today’s perspective, it might seem strange that it didn’t become the de-facto standard.  Boasting many of the same features as the modern DVD, you would think it couldn’t possibly have received the cold reception it did.  In this series of videos, we’ll find out why.

Here's a link to the entire playlist on Laserdisc:

The image of the film strip with analog audio only is in the public domain.  I forgot to add that as an image credit on-screen.

Some sources!
The 1958 date appears to come from Gregg's on recollection.  These sources suggest as such, anyway:  (thanks to Today I Found Out for curating these links, though as you'll see in the next video their assessment of the Laserdisc situation isn't quite that nuanced)

In the early 80s, his marriage fell apart after he came out as gay. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1988. At the time, there was only one drug approved to treat the disease, and a diagnosis often meant a death sentence.

With StoryCorps, Harris remembered how he came to work with the Atlanta Buyers Club, which distributed medications from the black market to people with HIV before the drugs had been approved by the FDA.

Forget dressing all in black. The Grammy Awards accessory of the night for anyone wanting to make a statement about female empowerment was the white rose. And EVERY diva owned it. The Times Up movement was loud and present at music’s biggest night. 

Performers and attendees alike showed up at the 60th annual Grammy Awards with a white rose- the night’s accessory that expressed solidarity with the #Time’sUp movement. Whether celebs wore theirs, or held theirs, or pinned theirs in their hair, whatever it was- everyone supported the movement

 Lady Gaga pinned hers elegantly to her collar, Kelly Clarkson proudly held onto hers, Lana Del Rey sported a massive white rose on her bracelet, Miley held her white rose close during the entire red carpet walk, Heidi Klum’s white rose made a nice contrast to her badass black dress, Camila Cabello carried hers proudly, Alessia Cara went the classic coursage route, as did Anna Kendrick, Rita Ora, Pink plus her daughter. And SZA, Cardi B, Andra D, and Nick Jonas got it on the Times Up rose too.

Nice to see celebs showing their support at such a high profile event, like the freakin Grammys! Who wore the rose best? And seriously which was your favorite performance of the night?! I mean, did yall see Kesha’s? So many powerful moments. So comment below and follow me on my socials @Miriamisa on Twitter, @Miriam_isa on Insta.

First startup should be in just a few weeks and we’re pumped to share that with you guys when the time comes as well! Thank you for the continued support on this build and thank you for watching!

Lyrics: 
You're the beach on Christmas Eve
Wrong place
Good time
Consistently
I feel like a walking love song.
When you do me like that
Can you tell my brain turns off?
My favorite set of stairs
Is the one up to your room
And my heavy set of cares
Evaporates all around you.
Evil comes in pairs
And we like what we do
You've got me feeling like a walking love song.
I must've caught you from 11:11
My lucky number 7.
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever.
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases
To go.
From 7-11's
To California heavens
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever.
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases
To go. / Click your heels
I'll take you home.
I found your slipper in the cold.
I feel like a played out love song.
Since when's it hurt so bad?
Can you help me turn this off?
Let's tangle our legs again
The world doesn't need us to leave our heads.
Let's tie our breath in knots again
Nothing's complicated if we pretend.
My favorite set of stairs
Is the one up to your room
And my heavy set of cares
Evaporates all around you.
My favorite time to stare's
When my eyes are on you
You've got me feeling like a walking love song.

She said it was ""both right and legal"" to take action against the Syrian government but it was not about interfering in the Syrian civil war.

Not because it's the best handling, or fastest car, or most luxurious car I drove last year but because the Stinger raises the bar for affordable performance vehicles. It's both practical and fun to drive, it's comfortable yet affordable and most importantly, it's attainable with the base model starting at $32,000 (right around the average new car in America) while the fire-breathing twin-turbo V6 model can be had for a reasonable $38,350. 

I doubt too many shoppers will be lured away from the traditional European luxury brands, and that's a pity because they will have no idea that they are over-paying for their A5 Sportback, 440i Gran Coupe or C43 AMG. Perhaps more impressive than that statement is the realization that the Kia Stinger is quite simply better than the Q50, Lexus IS or Acura TLX.

I can't keep up with all these stories. Enough is enough- these untrained pets people are claiming as ""Emotional Support Animals"" give ALL of us a bad name. Know your dog and its limits and comforts.

The articles don't give a lot of details or names, but what we do know is that apparently a little girl was boarding a Southwest Airlines flight and approached another passenger's Emotional Support Dog when the dog bit the little girl's face. The injuries were minor, and the dog and its owner left and did not continue their trip.

Drew Lynch is a comedian with a stutter and this is his dog with a name that's Stella.

Kylie Jenner officially revealed her baby daughter’s name on Instagram today, so everyone, say hello to STORMI! 

Kylie shared an adorable photo of Stormi holding onto her mom’s thumb, along with the caption “Stormi” followed by a little baby angel emoji. It’s clear that the thumb is Kylie’s from her perfectly manicured, baby pink nails--which are no doubt in honor of her baby girl.

Stormi is definitely not the name we were expecting. Fans have been speculating that Kylie and Travis were going to name their daughter “Butterfly”, or at least something that relates to the word, thanks to so many subtle butterfly references in their “For Our Daughter” video. 

The latest rumor was that Kylie’s daughter’s name started with the letter C, thanks to a Snapchat Kylie shared of a huge arrangement of flowers shaped as C. She captioned that post, “C is for…”, which made everyone think it was a baby name reveal. But it now seems more likely that the arrangement, which was a gift from Khloe, was actually for Kim and Kanye to welcome their baby daughter, Chicago. Way to keep us guessing, Kylie!

The fan reactions to Stormi’s name are already pouring in. One fan Tweeted QUOTE, “I think Stormi is a cute name. I think that's because I love Storm from Xmen😁”, while another added QUOTE, “stormi is actually super cute. i'm here for it”. Not everyone was impressed with the baby name, however. One person Tweeted QUOTE, “Everyone's out here lying that Stormi is a cute name”, while another echoed that sentiment, writing QUOTE, “I DON’T LIKE STORMI. CHANGE IT”. Guys, stop trying to RAIN on Stormi’s parade. Rain...Stormy...get it? Yeah I know you do.

Now the only question that remains, is what will Stormi’s last name be listed as? Stormi Jenner, or Stormi Webster? In case you didn’t know Travis Scott’s real name is Jacques Webster, so we’re assuming this baby won’t be named Stormi Scott. Although we gotta point out that would be catchy AF. Perhaps the parents will hyphenate their last names for their daughter, but regardless of what Stormi’s last name will be, we are just so happy that Kylie is doing well and clearly loving motherhood so far.

Stormi is a name that none of us saw coming, although it IS a name we’ve heard in the news recently. Porn star Stormy Daniels recently made headlines when an old tabloid story that she’d had an affair with Donald Trump before he was president but still married came to light once again. Of course, Stormy Daniels spells her name with a y instead of an i, so we’re guessing the inspiration for the name didn’t come from the porn star, and it is just a coincidence.

Alright guys now I wanna know what YOU think of Kylie and Travis naming their daughter Stormi--are you obsessed with it or are you disappointed that she won’t be called “Butterfly Jenner-Webster”? Let me hear your thoughts in the comments below, and after that click right over here to see Khloe and Kris respond to Kylie’s baby name rumors.

Shai couldn't understand how Bini kept getting at the food that was stored way up high, on top of Bini's cage. Bini was so small back then that there was no way it seemed possible for him to reach so high to get to the top of the cage.  What Shai caught on camera when Bini didn't think anyone was watching is never before seen footage of Bini outsmarting Shai. In this video you'll see baby Bini in action, and understand why even back in 2012, Shai could tell that Bini was an absolutely super-natural creature.

Sana received a casting offer from JYP Entertainment while out shopping with a friend back in Japan. She was only in 9th grade at the time and hesitant to take the offer at first, but she was a huge fan of KBS drama Dream High. When the casting manager told Sana that Wooyoung and Suzy were in the company, she immediately accepted the casting offer.

2 GOT7’s Jackson

Jackson was primed to become a national representative of Hong Kong’s fencing team. When he was initially approached by JYP Entertainment, Jackson’s parents were against the idea but told him that they’d let him go to Korea if he was able to bring home two gold medals. Jackson won both individual and team gold medals at the Youth Olympic Games and won himself a ticket to Korea.

3 Suzy

While she was still in middle school, Suzy was auditioning for Superstar K when she was spotted by a recruiter from JYP Entertainment. She was finding her way to the bathroom when she was stopped by the recruiter.

The recruiter liked her so much that she was immediately cast to JYP Entertainment and set to debut under the girl group miss A.

4 EXO’s Sehun

Sehun was eating tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) from a street vendor when a manager of an SM artist spotted him. When Sehun was approached, he felt skeptical about the manager so he followed him for 30 minutes to evaluate whether this was a real opportunity or not.

5 Jessica and f(x)’s Krystal

SM Entertainment wanted to cast Krystal at first, however her parents felt that she was too young. Instead they recommended Jessica, so Jessica joined SM Entertainment first then was followed by Krystal years later

6 SEVENTEEN’s Seungkwan

Seungkwan was cast through a video that his art teacher uploaded. His art teacher recorded a video of Seungkwan performing”Kite” by Big Mama at a singing competition and uploaded it after becoming curious about what the reaction would be online. After watching the video, Pledis Entertainment cast Seungkwan and he became a trainee and eventually debuted with SEVENTEEN.

7 GOT7’s Mark

Mark was cast by JYP Entertainment‘s talent recruiter in the USA while he was a high school student in California. Despite having no previous knowledge of the Korean entertainment industry, his visuals, as well as his talent, earned him a top spot.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Er72BGJGjtQ/hqdefault.jpg,0.020216802168021682,0.00016260162601626016,124.33333333333331,0.0013550135501355016,0.02037940379403794,0.021734417344173442,2018-01-02,12:34:05,Tuesday,1,10,23,10,21,60,200,0,37,0,2,9,21,4,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.499252850587642,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

A STUDENT with schizophrenia has set up an organisation to help other pupils with the condition - despite struggling with near-constant horror film-style hallucinations. Cecilia McGough, 23, studies health policy administration at Pennsylvania State University. She experiences a wide variety of hallucinations on a daily basis, including one based on the scary clown from the original movie version of Stephen King’s horror classic ‘It’, and another that resembles the little girl from Japanese thriller The Ring. Determined to use her own battles with the condition to help others, Cecilia founded Students With Schizophrenia, which is aiming to educate and spread awareness about schizophrenia on college campuses globally, as well as offering financial aid, academic and career services along with both mental health and legal support.

He and his brother Jermajesty along with their father Jermaine Jackson, made their debut performance in the Netherlands at MAX Proms in Dec. 2017.

This exclusive performance marks the stage debut for Jaafar and Jermajesty and is special because it's the first time Jermaine and his sons performed together and because Jermaine sings ""The Christmas Song"" again which he recorded for The Jacksons 5 ""Christmas Album"" in July of 1970 at the age of 15.

China's Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern history. It spans over 60 countries and will cost over a trillion dollars. The plan is to make it easier for the world to trade with China, by funding roads, railways, pipelines, and other infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa. China is loaning trillions of dollars to any country that's willing to participate and it's been a big hit with the less democratic countries in the region. This makes the BRI a risky plan as well. But China is pushing forward because its goals are not strictly economic, they're also geopolitical. 

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

Description: 
WWE chairman Vince McMahon is bringing back the XFL in 2020. What could go wrong? To recap how the XFL went down in 2001:

-The games were awful

-NBC And the WWF lost $35 million after investing $100 million into the XFL

-Vince himself called the league a colossal failure!

We’ve already explained here WHY the XFL could pose a threat to the NFL. But take a closer look, and it’s easy to believe that the XFL is bound to be a colossal failure again in 2020.

I’m Justin Fraction, and today we present 10 reasons why the XFL will fail again!

And a big shout out to Nate Lee for suggesting this video!

Please find our most recent and most requested video – “Aquarius Boat tour” – AMEL Super Maramu 2000.   This was the first video by Ken with new software, Final Cut Pro, and there was a bit of a learning curve.  I have been pushing Ken to finish the Vid for a few months, but this was worth the wait!!!!  In a very detailed way, I think too much detail sometimes, Ken shows a number of the system aboard Aquarius and how they work, like bow thruster and a look into the engine room, and….. so much more!

Bobbing, Bouncing, knees out, and elbows out. There are a few simple ways to combat these common cycling problems. 

The first is a combination of core work and stretching. This will not only allow you to keep yourself more stable while riding, it will also stop a number of the muscular imbalances that could lead to your knees or elbows coming out of line. 

The second is making sure your position on the bike is correct. For example if your saddle is too low you might find your knees coming out of line and you might bounce on the saddle at higher cadences.

Let us know how you get on with fixing your bad cycling habits in the comments below 👇

My first and only thought was a used Jeep Wrangler. In this video we see two Jeep Wranglers. One is Nice and one is not. He buys the nice one.

We’re breaking down ALL the hidden messages in the new 13 Reasons Why season two trailer. This episode is brought to you by Secret Active. New Secret Active provides protection in the moments when it matters most.

 If you thought Netflix was gonna drop the new teaser without some Easter eggs, you might wanna watch season one all over again.


Yesterday we told you that Netflix had finally released the first clip from the second season of 13 Reasons Why. With it, came the reveal of a May 18th premiere date and glimpse of the main storyline. It’s time to take a closer look at the trailer and dissect what you may have missed the first time around.

If season one was all about the tapes, then season two is all about the POLAROIDS. That’s clear from the first second of the teaser, which one-by-one shows the students of Liberty High frozen with polaroids floating around them. If you look carefully, each polaroid in the trailer reveals a clue about that person’s storyline in the show. This seems to reinforce the idea that nothing is as it seems on the surface.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O92pekaban8

Okay let’s break down the clues, one by one. First, we see Tony who looks like he’s simply getting out of his car holding a tape from season one. Once a few polaroids float by we see Tony’s actually been in a horrible accident, he’s holding a suspicious note, and his face is all bruised. Next, we see Jessica in her room taking a selfie, but then you realize “Liar” is spray painted on her window and a polaroid reveals a tear streaming down her face. All we can think is: has she come forward with her story to the public? Now, flash to Mr. Porter and “Know Your Place” is written on his window with another polaroid showing a break in. We also see him in his office pulling Bryce’s file from his drawer- so we know there’s a lot more trouble in store for Bryce. In the very next clip we get morsels of that storyline- and we’re dying to know what the heck is going on with this mystery girl at a party next to him? In a revealing polaroid the same girl is now passed out on the couch. Um, that’s not looking good.

As for Hannah’s Mom, she’s all alone without Hannah’s Dad and trying to put together the mystery of Hannah’s suicide. Polaroids that pass her face include one of For Sale signs with “Go Away” spray painted on them. Last, we see Clay putting on a tie in his room there are court summons documents on his bed that indicate he’s getting ready for a day in court. We know Hannah’s family is taking the school to court over Hannah’s death- but what will the trail unveil? When you see Clay’s face match up with a polaroid of Hannah’s we know the show is hinting at some sort of alignment between the two characters. Further evidence is the note on the back of the polaroid that Clay picks up that reads, “The tapes were just the beginning.” Does this mean Hannah will be BACK?!

On another note- did anyone else notice the threatening red signs throughout the trailer look oddly similar to notes from A on Pretty Little Liars? 13 Reasons Why definitely has a conspiracy on their hands. But unlike PLL, someone wants to hide the truth of Hannah’s death instead of setting it free. However, the clues surpass what’s seen on screen in the trailer. Bustle has pointed out that the song used in the teaser, Depeche Mode’s “I Feel You” makes lots of references to the afterlife. Is this ANOTHER clue that Hannah will be back?

We gotta pass this over to you guys now- did we miss any Easter eggs in the trailer? And what do you make of all the characters MISSING from the teaser like Alex, Justin, and Zach? Get to typing below! As always I’m your host Renee Shafii, thanks for tuning in. Now, click to the right for more details on the 13 Reasons Why season two release date and don’t forget to tap to subscribe! This episode was brought to you by Secret Active.

Lyrics:

Good for you, you fooled everybody
Good for you, you fooled everyone
Good for you, now you're somebody
Good for you, you fooled everyone

Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Don't get angry, don't discourage
Take a shot of liquid courage

'Cause my monsters are real, and they're trained how to kill
And there's no coming back and they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly, and they'll never say die
And there's no going back, if I get trapped I'll never heal
Yeah, my monsters are real

Good for you, you hurt everybody
Good for you, you hurt everyone
Good for you, you love nobody
Good for you, you owe no one

Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Call a doctor, say a prayer
Choose a God you think is fair

'Cause my monsters are real, and they're trained how to kill
And there's no coming back and they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly, and they'll never say die
And there's no going back, if I get trapped I'll never heal
'Cause my monsters are real

Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Don't get angry, don't discourage
Take a shot of liquid courage

Leave a light on if you're able
'Cause we both know you're unstable
Call a doctor, say a prayer
Choose a God you think is fair

'Cause my monsters are real, and they're trained how to kill
And there's no coming back and they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly, and they'll never say die
And there's no going back, if I get trapped I'll never heal
Yeah, my monsters are real

This is according to Unchained at Last, an organization that helps victims of forced and arranged marriages.

Such marriages are associated with a variety of negative outcomes, but thus far no state in the US has banned the practice outright. Last year, Democratic State Senator Jerry Hill attempted to make California the first to do so, but ran into opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood. He plans to re-introduce another version of the bill soon, however it will still allow for minors to marry.

Florida is now poised to become the first state to pass a full ban. Last week, a “no exceptions” bill authored by Republican State Senator Lizbeth Benacquisto was passed unanimously by her colleagues in the Senate. The bill is currently before the Florida house, where a floor vote is expected next week. However it has been met with some opposition and passage is no way guaranteed.

VICE News met with state lawmakers and child marriage survivors about attempts to change existing laws.

Lyrics:
Is it easy for ya 
if I took time 

would you feel secure if 
I told you everything on my mind 

Imagination 
Can take it’s toll
Let it run wild, with some time it can turn you cold 

Had an off night
Saving up your feelings 
till it feels right

Put up a good fight 
if you can’t throw a punch
Then it don’t feel right 

Cause Ya can’t cover it up any more
You gotta play or don’t show up oh
And you’re coming off so tough 
Are you sure, 
You’re strong enough to stay on my mind?

Are you strong enough?
Strong enough to stay on my mind x2

Make me crave your love 
So I miss ya when you're not by my side

CAN U KEEP UP
Keep me hanging on until our bodies touch

Are ya strong enough?

We’re way too young to
Even know

If we’re a moment
Or if we’re better alone

Don’t make a promise
If if you're gonna run

Give me no option
You're not strong enough

Had some good times 
Sending all our feelings 
Thru the phone line 

Put up a good fight 
if you can’t throw a punch
Then it don’t feel right

CHORUS:

Cause Ya can’t cover it up any more
You gotta play or don’t show up oh
And you’re coming off so tough 
Are you sure, 

You’re strong enough to stay on my mind?

Are you strong enough?
Strong enough to stay on my mind 

Make me crave your love 
So I miss ya when you're not by my side


CAN U KEEP UP
Keep me hanging on until our bodies touch


Are ya strong enough

BRIDGE:

You say
Give into me 
Give into me

But I don’t play that nice 

You say
Give into me 
Give into me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0V-QMUnGUY/sddefault.jpg,0.010651655296530364,0.00014648641861633114,72.71428571428571,0.0006277989369271335,0.010798141715146696,0.01142594065207383,2018-04-12,17:23:55,Thursday,3,6,6,6,6,32,54,3,10,0,0,5,3,1,0,4.0,8.0,"['A song by The Aces', 'STRONG ENOUGH', '', '2018 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED', '', 'HI']","['A', 'song', 'by', 'The', 'Aces', 'STRONG', 'ENOUGH', '2018', 'ALL', 'RIGHTS', 'RESERVED', 'HI']",True,"['A', 'song', 'by', 'the', 'ace', 'strong', 'enough', '2018', 'all', 'right', 'reserv', 'HI']",12,12,45,0,2,1,4,3.636566988138832,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Since he made his debut in 1988, Venom has become one of Spider-Man’s deadliest and most well-known foes. So well-known, in fact, that you’re probably already familiar with most of the facts about his origin. From the alien costume that Spidey picked up in Secret Wars to his defeat by a church bell and even his appearance in the classic Maximum Carnage video game, you might think you know it all. Dig a little deeper, though, and you might find a few facts that you didn’t know about Venom...

So here is part 2 of the free bike challenge, i went to hit some more MTB trails and the bike was surprisingly good!! 

Here is Part one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlyx2S2MBBU&t=349s

So the story is, I saw this bike advertised and it said ''free to a good home'' in its original state it was quite hard to ride but with a few tweaks this free bike is turning into a right weapon!! 

I switched the forks to marzocchi dirt jump 1's and put a heavy duty halo chaos mtb wheel off my jump bike onto it for security! 

Then I went down to Colchester bike park for a little shred!!

Hope you guys enjoy the video!!

""You look great! Have you lost weight?"" - I was always a little bigger than my friends, but hearing that comment drove me to go beyond the extremes of losing weight; I became anorexic.

These days, being skinny or ""fit"" is the new pretty. Even on Instagram, those that are skinny or in workout clothes get the most likes because that's what is deemed ""beautiful"". We constantly compare ourselves to these ""beautiful"" individuals making it our goal to get to where they are. Everything from dieting, becoming gym junkies, skipping meals, or even plastic surgery. As we continue our quest, no matter how hard or how much we view the mirror or whatever compliments we receive, it's never enough; I'm still fat.

Anorexia Nervosa is a mental illness eating disorder with the person having a strong desire to be thin, creating unhealthy eating habits and harming the individuals' overall health.

Signs of Anorexia are (not limited to):
- Low body mass index
- Restricting food intake
- Excessive use of Laxatives, diet pills, and purging food after meals.
- Denial of body image
- Obsessive fear of obesity
are amongst the limited signs of Anorexia.

The actor has grown up a lot since his days on the fan favorite drama, and now he's starring in the 2018 Karate Kid reboot series on YouTube Red, titled 'Cobra Kai.'

We caught up with the actor and he filled us in on all things 'Cobra Kai,' from what it was like going through intense training to making friends on set. Xolo also opened up about what it's like going to a normal high school while also pursuing his acting career – and as you could imagine, it's a lot to balance.

Starring alongside Xolo in the show is Tanner Buchanan from 'Game Shakers' and 'The Fosters,' Jacob Bertrand from 'Kirby Buckets,' and many other talented stars – and according to Xolo, they all became super tight on set. So sweet!

Be sure to catch 'Cobra Kai,' available to stream on YouTube Red on May 2, 2018.

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

Travis Wilkinson and his family were on a sailing trip in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, far north of the Arctic Circle. In late July, 2015, they were traveling through Hinlopen Strait, west of the largest island, Spitsbergen—an impossible route some summers, when pack ice blocks passage. But that summer, ice was especially sparse, making hunting harder for polar bears. These apex predators favor waiting at the sea ice’s edge, striking seals as they approach. A few days earlier, the Wilkinson family had been farther north, near the ice. There, bears looked healthy. But the scene just after midnight on July 23 was desperate. Mother and cub were struggling, skin hanging loose. According to Jon Aars, of the Norwegian Polar Institute, the cub, seven or eight months old, was likely to die if its mother didn’t eat soon. She probably wasn’t lactating. Wilkinson saw the bear sniff the air, picking up something of interest. This thin female couldn’t attack a healthy, full-grown walrus. A carcass would solve their problem. If the walrus were weak or sick, predation might be an option. But that walrus was alive and well. The situation was unworkable. The search for food went on.

FAOC-0Le8EE,T9UHD30MSGk,How to Sharpen Kitchen Knives,Charlie DIYte,26.0,2018-02-05 01:51:44+00:00,"['how to sharpen kitchen knives', 'lansky', 'controlled angle sharpening system', 'diamond deluxe', 'razon sharp knives', 'charlie diyte', 'skerper stropping compound', 'skerper pocket strop', 'skerper paddle strop', 'stropping']",1828660.0,14487.0,2137.0,1649.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FAOC-0Le8EE/default.jpg,"In today's video I show you how I got a razor sharp edge on my old kitchen knives using the Lansky Controlled Angle Deluxe Diamond Sharpening System.

I've got a number of kitchen knives that we've had for 15 years or so (a wedding present!) and I've never managed to keep them sharp. I've tried various sharpening systems with limited success.

Recent trawls of the internet led me to conclude that if I want to get a truly sharp edge on my knives, I had to do it with some sort of a controlled angle system. There are a massive array of manual and electric sharpening systems out there, but they receive mixed reviews when compared to the controlled angle systems.

I couldn't justify paying £199 or £269 for one of the Edge Pro systems, and so I decided that the Lansky Deluxe Diamond Sharpening system looked like a good compromise between quality and price.

I came across a company that seemed pretty knowledgeable https://www.knivesandtools.co.uk - and gave them a call to check that they agreed with me that it was worth the investment.

The guys at Knivesandtools were pretty clued up, and they suggested I also buy a strop - something I had never even heard of before their suggestion.

So here's the result - I hope you find it useful!

O filme mostra o sucesso meteórico da banda através de suas canções icônicas e som revolucionário, a quase implosão quando o estilo de vida de Mercury sai do controle e o reencontro triunfal na véspera do Live Aid, onde Mercury, agora enfrentando uma doença fatal, comanda a banda em uma das maiores apresentações da história do rock. Durante esse processo, foi consolidado o legado da banda que sempre foi mais como uma família, e que continua a inspirar desajustados, sonhadores e amantes de música até os dias de hoje.

[Lyrics]:

[Verse]
Ayy, bitch I been goin' and goin' like the Energizer
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut, smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say, they say life is a bitch and if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an adviser, but I do advise you to pay attention
Never need to mention, I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah, I've been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to your head
Fuck with me, watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead, I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna
I will, I will do like I've never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeah, yeah, like yeah, like yeah (woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (preach)
All you haters been abolished (preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (preach)
Just as long as they never say (preach)
""Daddy blew 20 million dollars (ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars and now cannot afford to send me to college (ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved, just like everybody wanna be accepted (ayy)
But somehow he had neglected me and my momma for all of this rap shit"" (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (ayy), no, I cannot fuck with that
Who you know dropped the album back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again and goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin' 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this, preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets, puttin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one? That be me, I'm the pride to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up, levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4 and I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore, but the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien

Bisher wurden Angriffe gegen App-basierte TAN-Verfahren und Mobilebanking von betroffenen Banken eher als akademische Kapriole abgetan. Sie seien, wenn überhaupt, nur unter Laborbedingungen und dazu unter wiederkehrend hohem manuellen Aufwand zu realisieren. Um diese Sichtweise zu korrigieren, haben wir das Programm Nomorp entwickelt, das in der Lage ist, zentrale Sicherungs- und Härtungsmaßnahmen in weltweit 31 Apps vollautomatisch zu deaktivieren und somit Schadsoftware Tür und Tor öffnet. Unter den Betroffenen stellen deutsche Unternehmen mit 20 Finanz-Apps die größte Fraktion.

ABOUT THE GAME:

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.

About The Opposition w/ Jordan Klepper:
In a TV news landscape where it’s impossible to know whom to trust, one man rises above the partisan hackery of the mainstream media to bring you the only truth that matters: his. From the fringe-friendly mind of Jordan Klepper, this is The Opposition.

FDFy7_DM_qQ,ug7voYQnUaE,Why Groundhogs Supposedly Predict The Weather On Groundhog Day,Business Insider,25.0,2018-01-30 21:31:08+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'Groundhog Day', 'Groundhogs', 'Tradition', 'Weather', 'Prediction', 'Punxsutawney Phil', 'Pennsylvania']",191711.0,994.0,76.0,123.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDFy7_DM_qQ/default.jpg,"On Groundhog Day, a bunch of men, wearing suits and top hats, pull a groundhog out of a hole in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. They then read a scroll the groundhog supposedly wrote, that states whether or not it saw its shadow. This determines if winter will last another six weeks, or if spring is coming soon. It's a bit of an odd tradition, but a similar practice has been taking places for centuries. Following is a transcript of the video.

Groundhog Day Announcer: Our buddy, Punxsutawney Phil!

As the tradition goes, every year on February 2, Phil the groundhog comes out of his hole in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If he sees his shadow, we'll supposedly get 6 more weeks of winter. If he doesn't see his shadow, winter is supposedly over.

Seems bizarre, right? So, how exactly did groundhogs become the go-to animal for predicting the weather?

Bill Murray: That's not bad for a quadruped. You gotta check your mirrors. Just side of your eye. Side of your eye.

The tradition comes from Germany. On an old religious holiday called ""Candlemas Day,"" the Germans paid attention to the badger. Candlemas Day was the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. If the badger saw its shadow, it meant a ""second winter"" was coming.

When the practice came to the US in 1887, the groundhog was chosen, because badgers aren't native to eastern North America. While it may seem random, there is some logic to turning to the groundhog for weather predictions.

Like badgers, groundhogs, also known as woodchucks or whistlepigs, are considered ""true hibernators."" When they emerge from hibernation, it means winter is almost over. In winter months, their body temperature drops 62 degrees. Comparatively, if a human body temperature drops just four degrees, it goes into hypothermia.

A groundhog's hibernating heartbeat is only five beats per minute. In warmer months, its heart beats 80 times per minute. Their breathing slows down in winter too. It can go from 16 breaths per minute to about two during hibernation.

However, the idea that groundhogs are predicting the weather when they come out of hibernation may be a bit of a stretch.

Groundhog Day Announcer: It's six more weeks of winter, it must be!

The real reason groundhogs come out of their holes in early February is to look for mates. Mating season is in March, so they wake up a little early to scope out potential partners and then return to their burrow to wait out the winter. Whether the groundhog sees its shadow on February 2 has more to do with the weather that day, than the groundhog itself.

After all, Punxsutawney Phil has only been right about 30% of the time.

Groundhog Day Announcer: What? Get it right for a change.

So we're probably better off listening to meteorologists. Or, just flipping a coin.

The teaser plays around with a Bob Ross homage, has some very R rated jokes and craftily includes flashes of images from the upcoming film. Reynolds is a producer on the film and the ‘Deadpool’ writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are back for the sequel. David Leitch replaces Tim Miller in the director’s seat for this installment in the franchise. ‘Deadpool 2’ is set for release on June 1, 2018.

Director of Vehicle Testing Dan Edmunds shares his thoughts after spending a weekend in our newest long-term test vehicle.

Q: How much does the 2017 Tesla Model 3 cost?
A: They're not yet building the $35,000 base vehicle with the standard battery. All 2017 Tesla Model 3 sedans have the long-range battery, so they start at $44,000. For the time being, the $5,000 Premium Upgrades package is a mandatory option, so the effective base price of the car is $49,000. This test vehicle was priced at $55,000 because it also has Autopilot ($5,000) and a paint color other than black ($1,000). Delivery and taxes are extra, of course.

Q: How far will the 2017 Tesla Model 3 go on a full charge?
A: Model 3 sedans built with the long-range battery are officially rated to deliver 310 miles of range. The base model will be rated at 220 miles when it debuts in the near future.

Q: How much power does the 2017 Tesla Model 3 have?
A: The rear-mounted electric motor produces 258 horsepower. There is no transmission because the Model 3 uses direct drive to power the rear wheels.

Q: How quick is the Model 3?
A: We have not yet brought our Tesla Model 3 to the track. Complete test results will be coming to Edmunds soon.

Ever since Pokémon GO launched, we've loved hearing stories of Trainers venturing abroad and playing together with new friends from different countries. That's what inspired us to create Pokémon GO Travel, a new way to see the world through the eyes of a Pokémon Trainer. To kick things off, Pokémon GO Travel is taking a diverse group of Trainers from around the world to Japan to host our first-ever Global Catch Challenge.

Join us as we discover new places, meet new people, and work together in an attempt to catch 3 billion Pokémon in just 7 days. Play along with IHasCupquake, Coisa de Nerd, and Rachel Quirico as they travel to learn more about Japanese culture, inspire the world to play together, and update you on the amazing rewards the community unlocks along the way—including Farfetch’d appearing worldwide for a limited time!

On a trip? Venturing to a new part of town? Share your #PokemonGOtravel story with us this week on your favorite social media channels.

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter The Canon - Which marketing tactic do you think was the most bold? Deadpool (Flooding the market/pushing boundaries), 10 Cloverfield Lane (Last-minute surprise attack), Split (Pure word of mouth via the twist)?

Will Jones - Hey John, long time fan! Much like how you thought Justin Long would be the next big actor I thought the same about Paul Schneider. After Lars and the Real Girl and Assassination of Jesse James I thought this guy had real talent. He was written out of Parks and Rec. and I haven’t seen him since. What happened? Thanks and bring on the filthy!

Cameron Moore - Is Disney waiting for the Super Bowl to drop the “Solo” trailer?  Star Wars has had success with the NFL Monday Night games, and Marvel has dropped spots during the Super Bowl before.

Gregar Vistonovich - I finally got around to watching Bright on Netflix after a few friends of mine said they liked it. It was such pure garbage. Just a terrible movie. But today I heard they officially gave the green light to a sequel for it. My question is, why?

Amanda Hyder - Hi John. The BF and I love the show and watch almost everyday. The shake up at Warner just made a major move by naming a new head of DC films. Question: Is Walter Hamada really a better choice for this job than Geoff Johns? Seems like an odd move to me.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FF3puqUSPvA/hqdefault.jpg,0.030962383739284588,0.001845600913086768,16.776315789473685,0.005901066077369533,0.032807984652371364,0.03870905072974089,2018-01-05,17:24:23,Friday,4,19,19,19,19,91,150,2,41,3,3,15,9,4,0,4.0,7.0,"['Nh', '', 'li =', '>', '', 'toe Solu', 's Smo c', '', 'BOSS OF 2', 'NUS', '', 'UNS Ties', '', 'EES', '', 'aaa o” r', 'MOHS W4d NWO NHOf3HL']","['Nh', 'li', '=', '>', 'toe', 'Solu', 's', 'Smo', 'c', 'BOSS', 'OF', '2', 'NUS', 'UNS', 'Ties', 'EES', 'aaa', 'o”', 'r', 'MOHS', 'W4d', 'NWO', 'NHOf3HL']",True,"['Nh', 'li', '=', '>', 'toe', 'solu', 's', 'smo', 'c', 'boss', 'OF', '2', 'nu', 'un', 'tie', 'ee', 'aaa', 'o', '”', 'r', 'moh', 'w4d', 'nwo', 'nhof3hl']",24,24,56,2,1,1,3,6.042592412939673,5,"['neutral', 'angry', 'happy', 'angry', 'neutral']",2,0,0,1,0,0,2,{'person': 5},5

Jake a depuis abandonné son entraînement et s’est retrouvé pris dans l’engrenage du milieu criminel.Mais lorsqu’une menace, encoreplus irrésistibleque la précédente, se répand dans les villes et met le monde à feu et à sang, Jake obtient une dernière chance de perpétuer la légende de son père aux côtés de sa sœur, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) –qui guide une courageuse génération de pilotes ayant grandidans l’ombre de la guerre. Alors qu’ils sont en quête de justice pour leurs camarades tombés au combat, leur unique espoir est de s’allier dans un soulèvement général contre la menace des Kaiju.

Jake est rejoint par son rival, le talentueux pilote Lambert (Scott Eastwood,Fast & Furious 8)et Amara (Cailee Spaeny) et par Amara,une hackeuse de Jaeger âgée de 15 ans, les héros du Corps de Défense du Pan Pacific devenant la seule famille qui lui reste. S’alliant pour devenir la plus grande force de défense que la Terre n’ait jamais connue, ils vont paver un chemin vers une extraordinaire nouvelle aventure.

The article goes into the script issues that were happening between Trevorrow and Kathleen Kennedy. It also details how many people gave the script a pass in an effort to get it to a script everyone could agree with and be happy proceeding to shoot. The article also debunks the rumor about Luke Skywalker’s death being an issue and looks at J.J. Abrams reaction to being asked to step back in and take over for Trevorrow. It also speculates if the script for Episode IX will have any shades of Trevorrow’s script.

John Rocha and Dennis Tzeng sit down to give you their thoughts on this article and what it has to say about the backstage issues that were occurring that led to Trevorrow being released as the director of Star Wars: Episode IX. They also speculate on J.J. Abrams coming in to take over . They also explore what we can expect to see from this series and what new or returning characters might appear.

Falcon Heavy. It’s ALMOST HERE! When it flies, it will be the most powerful and highly anticipated rocket of the 21st century. 

SpaceX will be attempting the ultimate feat in rocketry, strapping three orbital class boosters together to form a heavy lift vehicle. As if that weren’t enough, the Falcon Heavy will be attempting to land ALL THREE of its massive first stages boosters, two by land one by sea. 

SpaceX first announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011 saying the vehicle would be ready to launch in 2013… So why exactly has it taken five additional years to develop a rocket that’s essentially just three Falcon 9’s strapped together? 

Well, we’re going to dive into what all has changed since the 2011 announcement including what specific hardware and technology had to be developed. We’re also going to compare the Falcon 9 to the Falcon Heavy in a side by side comparison and explain just why exactly there’s so much more to the Falcon Heavy than just strapping three Falcon 9’s together.

BUSINESS ONLY - tanndilyt@gmail.com

World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., doing business as WWE, is an American entertainment company that deals primarily in professional wrestling, with revenue also coming from film, music, video games, product licensing, and direct product sales.

WWE also refers to the professional wrestling promotion itself, founded by Jess McMahon and Toots Mondt in 1952 as Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd. As of 2016, it is the largest wrestling promotion in the world, holding over 500 events a year (with the roster divided up into various globally traveling brands),[9] and broadcasting to about 36 million viewers in more than 150 countries. The company's global headquarters is located in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in major cities across the world.[10][11]

As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests, but purely entertainment-based, featuring storyline-driven, scripted, and choreographed matches, though they often include moves that can put performers at risk of injury if not performed correctly. This was first publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner Vince McMahon in 1989 to avoid taxes from athletic commissions. Since the 1980s, WWE publicly has branded their product as sports entertainment, acknowledging the product's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FOtsUijC5uo/sddefault.jpg,0.017643142476697737,0.0003328894806924101,53.0,0.0016644474034620505,0.017976031957390146,0.0196404793608522,2018-01-29,21:01:57,Monday,0,10,31,10,21,63,249,0,37,9,0,0,0,2,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.592202070730384,2,"['happy', 'sad']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

The surviving members of The Cars have not played together onstage for several years until the Rock Hall.

The Cars have been eligible to join the institution since the 2004 ceremony and were previously nominated in 2016 and 2017. All five of the band's members – vocalist-guitarist Ric Ocasek, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes, drummer David Robinson and the group's late bassist, Benjamin Orr – were included.  The Cars performed their hit singles Just What I Needed, My Best Friend's Girl and You Might Think.

The Killers' Brandon Flowers inducted The Cars into the Rock Hall earlier in the evening. He said ""On the back of what is now established as one of the greatest debut albums ever made, the Cars were named “Best New Artist” in the 1978 Rolling Stone Readers Poll. Forty years later they still sound like a new band to me.”

Weezer bassist Scott Shriner joined the group onstage in place of Orr who died in 2000.  Everyone from the Cars paid tribute to the late Ben Orr in his hometown of Cleveland during their speeches. ""Obviously it's hard not to notice that Benjamin Orr is not here,"" Ric Ocasek said. ""He would have been elated to be here onstage in his home town. It feels quite strange to be up here without him. We miss him and love him dearly.""

""I lived in Cleveland for a while – it was actually the first place I ever played music in front of people,"" said Ric Ocasek. ""I think it was about 20 blocks away. So I've only moved this far up the street for all those years.""

Bon Jovi, The Moody Blues, Dire Straits, Nina Simone and Sister Rosetta Tharpe were also inducted in the Rock Hall April 2018 ceremony.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPBQKmV1nN8/sddefault.jpg,0.009543867132307857,0.00025177799697273984,37.90588235294118,0.003086502033477587,0.009795645129280595,0.012882147162758184,2018-05-06,20:54:56,Sunday,6,21,29,21,29,100,190,4,31,1,0,16,0,8,4,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.496784880329606,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

It was the first competition of the Olympic season for us and it was great to perform our programs for the first time and see a bunch of our friends after the off-season.

By the way, the only reason we finished this Russia vlog was because we had 12 uninterrupted hours on a plane without Wi-Fi.

Become a Morning Person. I have a few tips to help you try to become a morning person and start waking up earlier. Sometime when we want to achieve our goals or new years resolutions we have to work through challenges. The biggest morning routine challenge is the horrible feeling you get when your alarm goes off. We have to do things we hate sometimes in order to reach our goals. If you want this to be an easier task give yourself a reason why you are doing this. A good solid reason as to why you want to achieve something will keep you motivated and help you get through the tough part.

At this point, almost everyone with access to the Internet knows about the disgusting video Logan Paul posted just before the new year that showed a man’s dead body after he had committed suicide in a Japanese forest. YouTubers, celebrities, and thousands of fans have since spoken out on the controversial video, but there was silence coming from something very important -- YouTube itself. Now, more than a week after the video was originally posted, YouTube decided to release an open letter regarding the situation. 

In a series of tweets, YouTube wrote QUOTE “Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently. You’re right to be. You deserve to know what's going on. Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week. Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views. As Anna Akana (uh-kah-nuh) put it perfectly: ‘That body was a person someone loved. You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness.’” 

One of the major criticisms people had regarding the way YouTube handled the Logan Paul situation was that they didn’t delete the video in the first place, but rather waited for him to take it off his channel. Also, Logan’s channel is still active, despite it clearly violating YouTube’s guidelines which could be cause for deletion. 

The statement continued QUOTE “We expect more of the creators who build their community on @YouTube, as we’re sure you do too. The channel violated our community guidelines, we acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences. It’s taken us a long time to respond, but we’ve been listening to everything you’ve been saying. We know that the actions of one creator can affect the entire community, so we’ll have more to share soon on steps we’re taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.”

Logan is currently on a social media break right now, but he apparently plans to come back soon. I guess only time will tell if he actually ends up facing those consequences YouTube mentioned. What do you think of YouTube’s statement? Sound off in the comments below. I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr thanks for watching and I’ll see you next time.

ABOUT BEARDBRAND
Beardbrand is a men’s grooming company that is helping men keep on growing by providing education and tools for urban beardsmen to master their morning routine. We’ve found that confidence starts with self investment, and allows men to do great things for their families, co-workers, and community. We are working to break down the negative stereotypes that surround bearded men, and show the world it’s the man who matters, not the way he looks.

Will they officially join the Clout Gang?
Which fact surprised you the most?

Ivan and Emilio Martinez are two popular YouTubers from Spain who left Jake Paul's Team 10 back in November 2017. They accused Jake of bullying them the entire time they were part of Team 10 and revealed that they didn't have any privacy in the house. Since they were two of the most loved Team 10 members, fans were shocked to hear that they were leaving. However, the Martinez twins are doing even better now that they're on their own. If you want to learn more about them, make sure to watch our video on 20 Things You Didn't Know About the Martinez Twins.

When the Martinez twins first moved into the Team 10 house, Alissa Violet was still living there as a member. Alissa is a very beautiful girl, but we had no idea that Ivan and Emilio found her hot. RiceGum asked them if they did while they were hooked up to a lie detector and they both said yes. But youll have to keep watching to see what Ivan and Emilios names would be if they were hot girls too.

Did you know that Ivan and Emilio were not allowed to open up their own bank accounts while they were with Team 10? Jake told them that they werent allowed to because of their visa. This meant that all of their money went into an account that was owned by Jake. The saddest part is that they just want to get their money back so that they can send it to their mother in Spain.

From their ultimate quad goals to getting deported to being one of Chad Teppers tattoos, theres a lot that you dont know about the Martinez twins. Make sure to keep watching to see why they chose to publicly expose Jake Paul.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FTI06Qh34xo/sddefault.jpg,0.014122280744359115,0.0012009644872810561,11.759116022099445,0.0015566092194261646,0.015323245231640172,0.016879854451066337,2017-12-24,18:00:01,Sunday,6,9,28,9,24,50,196,1,41,0,0,7,2,4,1,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.644173079123568,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Today’s practice invites you to slow it down and be still.

Listen to what is going on inside.

Time on the mat is time well spent because it’s time that you get to practice listening.

If you are here for the hip dips, great.

But today we refocus on why we are truly here.

Day 14 is a self-study & mindful mental health practice that is also a delicious and restorative day for the body, particularly your neck, back, and shoulders.

Subscribe to our channel : http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6 

In the world of filmmaking, we often imagine everything as being perfectly planned, rehearsed, choreographed, and perfect. But as most of us should know, there is no such things as perfection. Filmmakers are well acquainted with Murphy’s Law, which basically states that what can go wrong will go wrong. But hey, that’s life. Things don’t always go as planned. Not even in the seemingly perfect world of movie magic. It doesn’t matter how much you rehearse something, things can always take a turn for the worst. And sometimes mistakes can turn out to be a good thing and make scenes in films a lot better. These mistakes, or enhancements, are sometimes left in the final cuts of the films. Such is the case for several movies that we will be discussing today.
In Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord tries to hand over the orb that unbeknownst to him contains an Infinity Stone. But he ends up dropping it and without missing a beat grabs it and continues to hand it over to the Collector. This drop was a total mistake but it fits Star Lord’s dorky personality don’t you think? 
Did you know that the scene where Aragorn kicks a helmet and drops down screaming in agony was a mistake? No it wasn’t just the anguish of thinking Merry and Pippin were dead, Viggo Mortensen actually broke his toes when he did that take.

Not only does 6ix tell stories of how him and Logic work together but he also opens up the FL Studio file and even shows the plug-ins he used. 6ix goes on to talk about how his 3 favorite producers, Kanye West, J Dilla and No ID influenced him, how Illmind provided sound for 44 More and how they didn't use the Barrington Levy sample again because it took up most of the publishing of 44 Bars. 6ix also shares his reaction to Kevin Durant being inspired by 44 Bars and says that he wants to produce a track with him.

Introverts are a smaller group. It is believed that it’s easier for them to focus, that's why they can cope with our test without difficulty. And then, there are ambiverts – they are right in the middle and have the best of both worlds. But what type are you?
It's time to find out more about yourself: just look at a couple of pictures and try to find the hidden items in them. 

TIMESTAMPS

Picture #2 2:08
Picture #3 3:01
Picture #4 3:55
Picture #5 4:51
Picture #6 5:43
Picture #7 6:38
Picture #8 7:30

SUMMARY
- If you found the items easily, then you can be referred to as an introvert. You possess unique observation skills, and you know how to focus and see the tiniest details. You prefer to be by yourself rather than inside a noisy get-together, and feel a bit tired after you've spent hours communicating with others. Instead of going to the big party, you will most probably just stay home and read a book or watch the last episode of your favorite TV show, which you were too busy to catch up before. And you will still have a great time! 
- If you became bored looking for the items and lost your patience, then you are probably an extrovert. You are an active and emotional human being. You're completely different from the previous type – you will most probably become the life of the party, even if nobody knew you when you got there! After you've spent loads of time communicating, you feel energized and inspired by other people. You like to have conversations with others, and you know how to attract attention. You have a lot of friends and a long list of acquaintances, and you enjoy getting to know new people and make new friends. You are open to everything that's going on in your life, and you tend to react emotionally in most of the situations. 
- If you experienced difficulties but still passed the test, then you are an ambivert — a rare type of personality. You were probably confused listening about introverts and extroverts, as you could find similar traits to your character in both of these descriptions. Well, that's because you're right in the middle of the spectrum! You are a person of many talents, you know how to adapt to different environments, and you find it easy to talk to almost everyone. You're confident in yourself, and you feel comfortable in pretty much every social situation.

“He’s a Holocaust denier, he’s a white supremacist and he’s set to get the Republican nomination for a major congressional seat in Illinois.

Arthur Jones, a Prairie State anti-Semite who has been unsuccessfully running for office for decades, is poised to get closer than ever to office this year after emerging as the only GOP candidate for a congressional spot representing parts of Chicago and its suburbs.

Jones has made no secret of his view that the Holocaust is a “racket,” and he has even made that a prominent part of his latest bid for public office. His campaign website features a page called “Holocaust?” that includes a typed note calling the murder of 6 million Jews by Nazis “the biggest, blackest, lie in history” and falsely claiming there is no proof of the Holocaust beyond “a few professional concentration camp survivors.” The website also features a page calling the Confederate flag “a symbol of White pride and White resistance” and the LGBT rainbow flag “an attack on traditional Christian morality and religious freedom.”

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Wow...we've finally reached the end of 2017. It's been a long and challenging year to say the least with a vast amount of twists and turns along the way. A year of bad decisions, good decisions and growth in ways I couldn't possibly imagine. I couldn't have gotten through it however without the support of my amazing girlfriend Lynn, my family, our leader JoBlo and the amazing site crew, my close friends and of course...the power of amazing cinema.

If I've learned anything in this past year, it's that time, honesty, friendship and clear-thoughts are precious things that one must take great care with or you risk going down the wrong path. With that I present my return to the year-end movie mashup with Final Cut 2017 and wish everyone a brilliant and wonderful 2018.

P.S. Sorry that I missed Final Cut 2016! ;)

Snapchat’s latest update has upset a lot of fans, and Kylie Jenner, 20, is no exception. The lip kit mogul took to Twitter to express her frustration with the app on Feb. 21, and it’s totally relatable. “Sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me… ugh this is so sad,” Kylie tweeted. And, of course a few fans reiterated Kylie’s sentiments with “OMG if the queen of snapchat hates snapchat then why isn’t snapchat taking notes?? We don’t like it!!!!” So funny, right?

FAQs:

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.

Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?

This local hotpot place is awesome! The broth is DELICIOUS and the goat is not gamey at all. LOVED that goat leg as well.

Location 3: Quan 909
I was told that I HAD to try some water buffalo while in Vietnam. The meat was leaner than beef and not as flavorful. The broth I loved but the bbq was a bit underwhelming.

For those of you interested on how I make my videos, I primarily use Final Cut Pro X to edit my videos. I use different stock footages (both free and paid), clips of videos that I can find related to the video and search images to visualize the narrative and story that I’m trying to tell. I hire different researchers and writers for the script for each video along with my our original commentary and hire different voice over actors that can properly convey the the theme of the video. Most importantly, find the best background music, usually royalty free from Incompetech to create an exciting atmosphere while watching the video.

Correction: In a previous version, the Russian Empire at 2:31 did not include Finland and northern Kazakhstan and at 2:34 the map mistakenly depicted the Warsaw Pact members, not the Soviet Union.

At 2:03 the Minsk II agreement refers to the separatist enclaves as ""certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine"" not the DPR and LPR.

The present conflict in Ukraine started in 2014. Today, there are 100,000 fighters stationed in the country, making it one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world. In Ukraine's east, Ukrainian forces are engaged in a struggle with Russian-backed separatists. 

A ceasefire was called in 2015, with a security zone established that was meant to foster peace. However, today the security zone remains one of the most violent places in the Ukraine. With over 10,000 deaths to date, and over 1.5 million civilians displaced, the cost of ignoring the ceasefire continues to mount by the day. And both sides are still building up their forces.

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

=================================

INGREDIENTS:
1 whole roasting chicken
3 russet potatoes
1 onion
1/3 cup soy sauce
Olive oil
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 cloves of garlic
1 tsp crumbled oregano leaves
1 tsp crushed rosemary
Salt and pepper

Wash your vegetables. Thinly slice your onions and cube your potatoes and add to a large baking pan. Drizzle olive oil on top and add salt and pepper. Mix together thoroughly in the pan.

In a separate bowl, combine your soy sauce, 3 tbsp olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Stir together.

Prepare your chicken by discarding the giblets and neck. Rinse the chicken under cold water and pat completely dry. Place the chicken on top of your vegetables in the baking pan.

Brush your soy sauce mixture all over the chicken, flipping it to make sure you cover the underside, and also brushing the inside of the cavity. Make sure to place the chicken breast side up in the pan.

Place the baking pan in an oven at 375F for an hour and a half. A meat thermometer can also let you know when the chicken is fully cooked through when the inside is 180F.

Every thirty minutes, remove the chicken from the oven and re-brush with your soy sauce mixture. Also make sure to stir the vegetables.

When it's finished, remove from oven, let cool, and carve up and serve!

Blue Ivy told Beyonce and Jay-z to stop clapping during Camila’s speech at the Grammys  and it was nothing short of iconic - Blue Ivy is literally the only person who would dare sush Queen B.

Jay-z, Beyonce, and Blue Ivy were seated VIP in the front row at the Grammys and rightfully so seeing as though they are basically musical royalty. Naturally, ANYTIME the camera is on them people watch with full attention, but one moment in particular during the show has the internet in a frenzy. During Camila Cabello’s speech, the camera happened to pan over to Beyonce and Jay-z just as they began to applaud and caught Blue Ivy gesturing for her parents to relax. 

This is easily one of my favorite things that has ever happened. I definitely don’t think she was throwing any shade. I think it was more of a ""OMG Mom & Dad, let her finish before you start interrupting!"" Because remember, to her they’re not HOV and Queen B, they’re just mom and dad.  Maybe she’s a big Camila fan and really wanted to hear what she had to say. Or maybe she thought it best that they collectively don’t show emotion. Either way it was frickin hilarious and the internet can’t get over it. 

Rap Up tweeted – “Blue Ivy for president.” One person wrote – “Blue Ivy is the only person who can tell Beyoncé and JAY-Z to calm down. A LEGEND.” Another said – “Blue Ivy was like “no no I will give the signal to clap.” 

No one really knows why she did it but I am here for the sass. Why do you guys think Blue gestured for her iconic parents to relax? Sound off in the comment section below.

Thank you, everyone, for all the support of this video. I’ve been involved with media (photography, video, content creation, writing, journalism) since 2007. It’s amazing how you can use one video (like this one) or a picture or an article and shift the mind of many changing cultures. I hope I can do my part to inform, improve media, and shift culture in a positive way.


Got follow up questions like ""did you get your card back?"" Check out my follow up video here: https://youtu.be/COlsbNNZsTM

Oakland, Ca - At around 11:20 AM a white woman approached a black man named Deacon for having a BBQ grill at Lake Merritt today.
She told him he could not BBQ there and called the police. She would not leave Deacon alone. A young black woman was walking by overheard how the white woman was harassing him telling him he can not be there, she stopped and asked the woman to leave her alone. The white woman became aggressive with the woman. She started filming the woman's aggressive behavior and has told us it's up on Facebook (probably a live stream).
Shortly after that Deacon's friend Kenzie arrived. According to Kenzie, the woman said ""Oh another nigger."" She proceeded to tell all three of the people at the BBQ table that she owned the park, and they are not allowed there. She also said them they were going to jail.
Kenzie's wife (me) was up the street finishing brunch at Lakeshore Ave. He texted me a picture of the white woman and said: ""If I go to jail this who did it to me.""
So I walked over to the scene, and that's where the video starts. I arrived 12:50 pm.

The police did not stop the BBQ. They spoke with Deacon about an hour later and said they were BBQ-ing in a permitted zone.

Referred to as franchise Viagra in the past, his very inclusion in a film is enough to bring a lot of people to the theaters and that is due in large part to the lovable persona he has crafted. While there are certainly some wrestlers whose statements make it abundantly clear that they too hold him in high esteem, we’d be lying if we tried to pretend there aren’t dissenting voices. That is what inspired us to create this list detailing some of The Rock’s most outspoken proponents and detractors. In that light, we searched in order to bring you this depository of the people who’ve said the most about The Rock on either end of the spectrum. We’ve also done our very best to decipher when comments seem to be meant to set up a wrestling storyline.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

From filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  

“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).

Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FjVljgn3nRs/sddefault.jpg,0.02874548379440386,0.0012394841636119095,23.19148936170213,0.0036393364803924155,0.02998496795801577,0.03362430443840818,2018-03-14,23:40:48,Wednesday,2,5,1,5,1,24,2,1,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,4.0,2.0,"['Ps ea ta RSS Seo', '', ' ', '', ' ', '', ' ', '', ' ', '', ' ', '', ' ', '', 'Ki) yee', '', 'beet) F tele) 7']","['Ps', 'ea', 'ta', 'RSS', 'Seo', 'Ki)', 'yee', 'beet)', 'F', 'tele)', '7']",True,"['Ps', 'ea', 'ta', 'rss', 'seo', 'Ki', ')', 'yee', 'beet', ')', 'F', 'tele', ')', '7']",14,12,30,3,1,3,0,5.085223503245286,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

The last several days has been so weird, I am not one to like skipping class, even for illness. I didn’t go to a couple of classes in order to rest at home (in the beginning of the video my cold was a mere cough and then it would blow up to flashes of fever and more and more coughing ughHH) and now, I feel better, just constantly coughing from time to time. It’s been gross.. Like in a restaurant, or in someone’s store, I have to spit out mucus into a napkin. Cringe.

But I am very happy that it is the start of break! I think this weekend has been the first in a long time that I have felt THIS well rested, and care free. Mind you- I have 3 huge projects on the table in conjunction with other art painting assignments, because the fall term for uni is ending in the next couple of weeks! Going to be hectic. But as always, I am so blessed to have this education, and every opportunity to explore my passions and grow as a person and artist. Thank you for coming along this journey with me, and for being a part of this amazing, loving community. It’s amazing.

I will be going to NY in the middle of the week, and perhaps spending thanksgiving there! If you see me, DO say hello! I would love love to hug and meet you.

Thank you for all the holiday video suggestions, btw! Really want to make time to decorate, finally, and maybe make more WeWednesdays? Baking ideas certainly sound fun- and my sister is amazing at making paper snowflakes so perhaps we will dazzle up our little dorm 8-) We shall see.

Until then- happy thanksgiving!

Best,
Annabelle

It's been a busy week, with a trip to the BMW Welt to collect the M5 as the icing on the cake. The latest Shmeemobile arrives to be the daily driver in Germany, a car from BMW M and hence there will be a lot of content to come as we get to know it inside-out. 

The 6th Gen M5 mixes incredible performance with vast levels of technology, making it a super-saloon and a dream daily driver. I'll be taking the car to events like the Nurburgring 24H, Le Mans 24H and on other adventures around the continent as I get to know the M5 over many thousands of miles. We'll also be making special visits to venues like the factory, BMW individual, and experimenting more with the intelligent M xDrive system and the ability to pop it purely into 2WD mode - if 4WD/4WD Sport isn't your thing.

The car comes with thanks to BMW M who have very kindly provided it for test purposes over the coming months. As a car of particular interest to both myself and many of you - this seems like the perfect time to get to know what it's all about and put it through its paces.

To kick things off, a collection experience was lined up at the famous BMW Welt in Munich. It's a location home to handovers of cars to those from the USA and Canada doing 'European Delivery', but also to almost 20,000 customers from Germany, Italy, France and more who choose to come to the factory for the experience. As a way to have a memorable time collecting a new car, I honestly could not recommend it enough, it felt truly special and exciting.

It's been a busy week, collecting my Dad's Aston Martin DB11, then both my new Ford Focus RS Heritage Edition and Red Edition, and now the long-term test car BMW M5, but certainly one I won't forget as the new adventures for this summer get underway!

Thanks for watching, Tim

In light of the assault and harassment allegations directed at former Today show anchor Matt Lauer, many of the morning show icon's on-screen moments are now being reviewed through a much darker lens. Lauer was fired from his post at NBC in November 2017 after 20 years with the network. Given these awkward, cringe-worthy segments, it now seems surprising that his career survived for so long...

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/GmtyPv

Black holes are mysterious and bizarre objects in the universe that really have no explanation. In fact, we hardly know anything about what lies inside of a black hole. We know and understand what we see on the outside of a black hole, but we have no way of going inside one to take a look at what is really happening. Even if we sent a probe inside a black hole, it would not survive the journey, and there would be no way that the probe could transmit a signal outside once it had been sucked inside. This is because a black hole is the product of mass being squeezed together so densely, and so tightly, that it creates a gravitational pull that is so strong, that not even light can escape its grasp.

Supermassive black holes with masses millions to billions of times that of the sun are thought to lurk at the hearts of all galaxies in the universe. You may notice that when you see a photo of a spiral galaxy, such as the Milky Way, in the center of the galaxy is a giant mass of light, which many people would think looks like a massive sun.

But this is not light coming from the black hole itself. Remember, that light cannot escape the heavy gravitational pull. Instead, the light we see comes from the magnetic fields near a spinning black hole that propel electrons outward in a jet along the rotation axis. The electrons produce bright radio waves. Quasars are believed to produce their energy from massive black holes in the center of the galaxies in which the quasars are located. Because quasars are so bright, they drown out the light from all the other stars in the same galaxy.

You’re probably asking, ‘well, what’s a quasar?’ A Quasar is the short name for ‘quasi-stellar object’ and is a very highly energetic object surrounding an actively feeding Supermassive Black Hole. In more basic terms, the Supermassive Black Hole in the middle of a galaxy feeds intermittently. As it feeds, gas swirls around it at incredible speeds and forms an insanely bright hot orbiting disk. And if the black hole is swallowing a large amount of material, this feeding is accompanied by gigantic jets of gas. These are called Quasar. They are essentially fueled by the Black Holes they orbit.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FoExPq04OQQ/sddefault.jpg,0.008714765237218034,0.0004586355557731871,19.001503759398496,0.0011590030849275804,0.00917340079299122,0.010332403877918802,2017-12-21,15:21:34,Thursday,3,7,72,7,48,38,519,3,86,1,4,5,24,1,8,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.524477054586134,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Demi Lovato is embracing her Latina roots in her upcoming new song.

Demi Lovato JUST dropped her album, but she already has a new song in the works.

Demi Lovato’s sixth studio album “Tell Me You Love Me” has only been out for two months and Demi is already teasing us with a new song. The album was everything we could have hoped for and we may or may not be counting down the days until her “DEMI X DJ KHALED TOUR” kicks off.

We know by now to always expect the unexpected from Demi, which is why we are seriously freaking out about her latest Instagram post that gives us a teaser clip of her brand new song. The catch is that this song is set to be all in SPANISH and will be featuring the iconic Luis Fonsi.

Luis is one of the hottest singers right now, and hold the title for most watched video in YouTube history for his hit song “Despacito”, that currently has over 4.3 BILLION views. Ever since Despacito topped the charts, there has been a huge influx in Spanish songs hitting the radio.

Popular girl group Little Mix even recently collaborated with CNCO for their song “Reggaetón Lento” and we have seen more Spanish influences in pop music, and we are totally not complaining.
Demi has always been vocal about her Latina roots and wanting to connect more to heritage. We first heard about Demi and Luis’ collab last month, so we were so excited to finally get a teaser of what they’ve been working on. While Demi posted a 10-second clip on Instagram showing off her Spanish

Luis announced the name of the song, “""Echame La Culpa"" which translates to “Blame Me”, and said that it’s being released on November 19!

We cannot wait to hear the song in its entirety, we know it’s going to be a good one.

Are you excited for this incredible collab? Let us know in the comments below and then click here to see the best performances from the European Music Awards. I’m Renee Shafii, thanks for tuning in.

Once upon a time, American actor and martial artist Wesley Snipes was the most in-demand action star in show business—and for good reason. Snipes' unique ability to be both athletic and charming led to some very successful performances. These days, however, Hollywood doesn't seem to give him much work anymore, and here's why...

Jordan and director Ryan Coogler were in Seoul on the first leg of a worldwide tour to promote the ""revolutionary"" superhero movie.
The stars of Black Panther kicked off the movie's international tour this week in South Korea, where key action scenes were shot, and were eager to discuss the political aspects of Marvel's most diverse franchise.

""My own personal culture and heritage is something I've always appreciated since I was very young and I've always loved superhero comic books and movies. So it's a blessing to be able to merge these two ideas into one project. It was really surreal to be a part of this process,"" director Ryan Coogler told reporters during the Asia junket held Monday in Seoul. The filmmaker added how he was in his northern California hometown with his wife when he received the directing job offer from Marvel, and the first thing he did was visit the comic book store where he first came across the original Black Panther books as a kid.

Chadwick Boseman, who plays the lead role of the shadowy superhero as well as T'Challa, the young ruler of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, also expressed his excitement of being part of the franchise. ""I never said yes to any role without reading the script, without knowing the director,"" he said about agreeing to take part in the project while attending a red-carpet event in Switzerland.

Do turbo blankets actually work? What is the purpose of a turbo blanket? What are the advantages of using a turbo blanket?

This video involves two tests, one completed by myself and Humble Mechanic, the other as a thesis for a masters at UT Austin. For our tests, we seek to see if there are any major temperature differences between using a turbo blanket, versus not. This can mean different cabin temperatures, lower hood temperatures, lower engine bay temperatures, and even lower intake air temperatures. 

The idea of a turbo blanket is that it keeps all the exhaust heat contained within the turbocharger, rather than radiating out from it. This means more heat is contained as useful pressure, and that pressure spins the turbochargers. With more pressure, you create more power. Does it actually work? Let's watch and find out!

Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, where I did loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! Nail videos are too difficult to film + I prefer makeup!
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? 21

I'm finally catching up with the vlogs, it's December yay! I head to a Jo Malone breakfast with some wonderful ladies and then over to Feel Unique to record a full Tom Ford beauty look for New Years Eve that ends up inspiring a blog post too. Then it's back to the flat for some time with Alex and opening some absolutely insane beauty advent calendars. Thank you to all the lovely brands that have gifted them to me :) and a HUGE thank you to Dolce & Gabbana for the incredible pieces they gifted to me too, so so lucky x

I bought this rotary engine from ebay. It is obviously used, so I thought I would clean it and make a video about it. The engine is so beatiful, and so nicely made.
I'm not sure where I will install it though. In the beginning I was hoping to put it in the MK2 micro chainsaw, but it is a very smokey engine. Maybe I'll restore my childhood's nitro rc car and put it on it. Any suggestions?

We also visited Fun Spot to ride their newest wooden roller coaster Mine Blower. The start of the day was in Old Town where we ventured around to all of the quant little storefronts to see what sort of things they had for sale. It was very much like a flea market of sorts with some very random retail locations including a store called Groovy that sold all sorts of hippie themed merchandise and another one called Wound N' Around that sold merchandise based on the 50s and 60s. After we did some window shopping and went into lots of strange stores we headed over to Fun Spot to see what sort of attractions they had to offer. Fun Spot has an all new wooden roller coaster called Mine Blower that we haven't had a chance to ride yet so we paid our $10 and got on front row! It was a fun little roller coaster with one inversion. It was a bit rough, but most wooden roller coasters are. I would ride it again. All in all it was a fun trip to Old Town and Fun Spot. Join us again tomorrow for another new video.
