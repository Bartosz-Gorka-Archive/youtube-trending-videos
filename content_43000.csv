sikEngOp2Co,JrFiNSueT3Y,Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard Skipped SAG Awards for THIS Reason,Clevver News,24.0,2018-01-22 20:14:08+00:00,"['News', 'newsfeed', 'clevver news', 'entertainment', 'stranger things', 'finn wolfhard', 'millie bobby brown', 'Sadie sink']",52467.0,1446.0,50.0,301.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sikEngOp2Co/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

In case you were wondering why the heck Finn Wolfhard wasn’t at the SAG awards, don’t worry he’s fine and has a solid excuse. 

Am I the only one who thought he wasn’t there because he found out Millie Bobby Brown is dating Jacob Sartorious? 

Let me stay out of pre-teens’ business and tell you the real reason why Finn was MIA. In case you missed it the Screen Actors Guild Awards were last night and naturally the cast of Stranger Things was in attendance looking adorable per usual. But noticeably a key member of the squad was missing in action. Finn Wolfhard! We missed you dude. 

So no he wasn’t MIA because he was salty about Millie dating someone else. We don’t even know if they actually had a thing going anyway. He tweeted before the show to let his fans know that he would not be in attendance because he has the flu. He wrote QUOTE - “I had flu and I couldn’t get to the sags on time! Hope everyone has a wonderful time! Root for us!”

Stranger Things was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series and Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Comedy or Drama Series.
And just to be clear, Millie did not show up with Jacob Sartorious. Also is it weird that I kind of want her and Finn to hold hands on the playground? They’re just so cute. Let me stay out of grown folks business. Do you guys ship them or do you like Millie with Jacob Sartorious?

Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey and I’ll see you next time.

Gaming Historian provides a history of the SEGA 32X. In an effort to stay ahead of the game, SEGA released the 32X in late 1994. It was an add-on that transformed the Genesis from 16-bit to 32-bit. SEGA pitched it as a cheaper alternative to the upcoming next-gen systems. But in less than a year, it was forgotten. The 32X damaged SEGA's reputation with developers and consumers.

See #CrazyRichAsians in Cinemas this August.

Jon M. Chu (“Now You See Me 2”) directed Warner Bros. Pictures’ and SK Global Entertainment’s contemporary romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians,” based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan.
The film features an international cast, led by Constance Wu (“Fresh Off the Boat”); Henry Golding, making his feature film debut; Gemma Chan (“Humans”); Lisa Lu (“2012”); Awkwafina (upcoming “Ocean’s 8,” “Neighbors 2”); Harry Shum Jr. (TV’s “Glee”); with Ken Jeong (the “Hangover” films”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Star Trek: Discovery,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”).  The film’s large ensemble cast also includes Sonoya Mizuno (“La La Land”), Chris Pang (“Marco Polo”), Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”), comedian Ronny Chieng (“The Daily Show”), Remi Hii (“Marco Polo”), Nico Santos (“Superstore”) and Jing Lusi (“Stan Lee’s Lucky Man”).
Color Force’s Nina Jacobson (“The Hunger Games” films) and Brad Simpson (“World War Z”), and Ivanhoe’s John Penotti (“Hell or High Water”) produced the film, with Tim Coddington, Robert Friedland and Kwan serving as executive producers.  The screenplay is by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim, based on the novel by Kwan.
“Crazy Rich Asians” follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Golding), to his best friend’s wedding in Singapore.  Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick’s family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life.  It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country’s wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors.  Being on Nick’s arm puts a target on Rachel’s back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick’s own disapproving mother (Yeoh) taking aim.  And it soon becomes clear that while money can’t buy love, it can definitely complicate things.
The behind-the-scenes team included director of photography Vanja Cernjul (“Marco Polo”), production designer Nelson Coates (“Fifty Shades Darker”), costume designer Mary Vogt (“Kong: Skull Island”) and editor Myron Kerstein (“Going in Style”).
“Crazy Rich Asians” was filmed entirely on location in Singapore and Malaysia.
Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with SK Global Entertainment, a Color Force/Ivanhoe Pictures/Chu Studios Production, “Crazy Rich Asians.”  The film is set for release beginning August 17, 2018, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Entertainment Company.

This video is aimed towards children and people with learning or hearing difficulties, but can be enjoyed by all :)

Makaton is a unique language programme which consists of signs and symbols, ideal for those with learning difficulties. The visual aid helps people to communicate and express needs.
Please visit the Makaton Charity Website: http://www.makaton.org for more information.
(The signs are very similar to British Sign Language)

Although I've been using Makaton signs for the past since 2004, I only did my first formal Makaton course in 2014. And though I have been studying signing books since then, I am still only a beginner! The reason I began signing is because I have several fostered and adopted sisters who use Makaton to communicate and I originally began making my videos to encourage them as they learn new signs easier when it is fun. My sisters and I all love music! Since then, it has grown because my sisters wanted to share the videos with their school friends. I hope you continue to enjoy my videos as much as I enjoy making them.

Climbing to the top of Mt. St Helens and looking down into the massive crater below was a truly amazing bucket list item for me. It was the hardest climb of my life, but absolutely worth it. However  I had no idea of the unbelievable magnitude of destruction the eruption left below the mountain. St. Helens erupted May 18th 1980 with such force that it changed the surrounding landscape and destroyed everything in it. Finding all the mangled abandoned trucks still sitting on the county side and walking through the lava tubes was just as incredible as being able to finally climb to the top of the mountain to see it for myself.

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:
The Screen Actors Guild Awards® presented by SAG-AFTRA has become one of the industry's most prized honors. The only televised awards show to exclusively honor performers; it presents thirteen awards for acting in film and television in a fast moving two-hour show, which airs live on TNT and TBS. The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

This is a live stream of the moon via NASA TV from multiple viewing points. This full moon is the third in a series of “supermoons,” when the Moon is closer to Earth in its orbit -- known as perigee -- and about 14 percent brighter than usual. It’s the second full moon of the month, commonly known as a “blue moon.” The super blue moon will pass through Earth’s shadow to give viewers in the right location a total lunar eclipse. While the Moon is in the Earth’s shadow it will take on a reddish tint, known as a “blood moon.” The first time this has all occurred since 1866!

Why is it called a Super Blue Blood Moon?
🌕Supermoon = When the Moon is at or near its closest point to Earth
🔵Blue Moon = The second full moon in a month
🔴Blood Moon = The red tint Earth’s shadow casts on the Moon during a lunar eclipse

The opening scenes portray a young girl in need. She is given a new orange backpack by a United Way worker, and then brings her parents along to receive assistance with basic needs and financial stability. The girl progresses through school and benefits from academic support, and then ultimately graduates from high school. This same young girl returns to United Way to provide support to future children. The music video portrays how parents, schools, and United Way work in partnership to open doors for every child to achieve their dreams. 

Masa Fukuda’s arrangement of the “A Million Dreams” and the voices of One Voice Children's Choir beautifully illustrate United Way of Northern Utah’s capacity to make a difference in many children’s lives, which then inspires those children to reach out and positively influence others. Inspiring hope is a common thread in the missions of both the United Way and One Voice Children’s Choir, which this video richly portrays. 

Make a tax-deductible donation to United Way to help assist children in need: https://uwnu.org/a-million-dreams/a-million-dreams.html, or by clicking on the donation link within the video.

Lyrics:
(On my phone)
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone

I try to pull the curtains back
Turn you off but can't detach
When all I want and all I know
Is time spent looking at my phone

(On my phone)

Find me when the lights go down
Signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home
Find me staring at my phone

I'm wondering where the hours went
As I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow
Time spent looking at my phone

Last thing that you need
Is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared
Devoured by perverted creatures

Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones

(On my phone)

Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone

I call you, you don't call me back
Almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan
Time spent looking at my phone

Clouds are getting full
So you close all the windows
I would never let you die
Even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need
Is a way to remember
You can never find the time
If you spend everyday looking at your phone

You should come with me
We can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed
And then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again
You can go ahead and stop pretending

Mark Tremonti is the Grammy Award-winning guitarist and songwriter known for his work in the critically acclaimed Alter Bridge and in the multi-platinum rock juggernaut Creed.  His sound is recognizable and has garnered him a loyal fan base worldwide. 

In 2012, Mark formed Tremonti with Eric Friedman and Garrett Whitlock as an outlet for his love of harder riffs and the band has released three full-length albums to date. On June 8th, Tremonti returns with their fourth album A Dying Machine, a concept album that showcases Mark’s unique songwriting style and vocal melodies. Anthemic choruses, punishing riffs and fiery guitar solos are showcased on the album in rockers like ""From the Sky"" and ""Throw them to the Lions"" and places them alongside the infectiously catchy ""Take You With Me"" and ""The First The Last"".

Tremonti will be on a worldwide tour in support of A Dying Machine including opening for Iron Maiden this summer.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/suGBbS4gylM/sddefault.jpg,0.010128368520729021,0.0003191203588690213,31.73839662447257,0.0006988331909410213,0.010447488879598043,0.011146322070539064,2018-04-06,14:57:50,Friday,4,11,21,11,20,66,178,4,40,2,0,8,3,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.751087252528483,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{},0

Harry Styles performed at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show over the weekend in the company of THREE of his exes. 

Dating multiple Victoria’s Secret models sounds like a dream, until you have to perform at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. 

Although it isn’t televised in the US until November 28th, The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show took over Shanghai over the weekend when the Angel’s stomped to the death down the runway. Harry Styles was one of the musical guests and naturally everyone was so excited because duh it’s Harry Styles, but it just so happens that he’s dated three of the Angel’s who walked in the show. In other words, remember what happened to the Weeknd last year when he had to sing as Bella Hadid strutted past him looking like a beautiful snack, well that happened to Harry Styles x3. 

Sara Sampaio, Georgie Fowler, and Nadine Leopold have all done two things, strutted the Victoria’s Secret Runway and been linked to Harry Styles according to the Daily Mail. 

One fan tweeted – “Harry styles is literally performing in a room that's filled with his exes.” 

While performing at an event where you literally have to come face to face with not one, not two, but THREE  of your exes in lingerie seems a bit awkward, sources say that watching the show you had no idea. Everyone was extremely professional and unphased. So it sounds like Harry survived this one, but remembers those rumors that Taylor Swift was also going to perform? It didn’t happen but can you imagine? The three model exes plus Taylor Swift? I would dig Harry’s grave for him. 

But thankfully he survived and apparently killed it. He performed a special rendition of “Only Angel” which of course was very fitting. He also performed “Kiwi” during the Punk Angels segment of the show. You can catch all the action when the show airs November 28th. What would you guys do if you had to perform in front of three of your half naked exes? Sound off in the comment section below and don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey and I’ll see you next time. Click left to see one of the angels fall from runway heaven. This episode was brought to you by T-Mobile.

While he was in Hospice, in the last months of his life, I had the idea to play some of our favorite music for him. It gave us both an opportunity for peace and healing and joy in some very painful times. This is the most difficult and personal video I have ever made. I hope my father's legacy of music can bring some hope and healing to anyone going through a hard time.

안녕하십니까. 저는 대한미군 UN군 사령부 채드 캐롤 대령입니다.

오늘 저희는 판문점 귀순 사건과 관련한 UN군 사령부의 입장을 발표하겠으며 공동경비구역을 통한 11월 13일 귀순 사건 관련한 CCTV 영상 일체를 공개할 예정입니다.

본 영상의 공개 목적은 해당 일자에 발생한 사건을 시각적으로 정확하게 보여주는 것에 있습니다. 모두 아시는 바와 같이 지난주 본 영상을 공개할 예정이었으나 추가적인 영상을 더 확보하여 최대한 사건을명확하게 하기 위해서 영상의 공개를 연기하였습니다.

본 영상 시청 완료 후 보도자료에 있는 링크를 통하여 영상을 다운받으실 수 있습니다. 오늘 여기서 질의응답은 받지 않겠으나 브리핑 후 추가적으로 질문을 받아 추후에 최대한 빨리 답변드릴 수 있도록 하겠습니다.

이해를 돕는 차원에서 설명을 드리면 본 영상은 다양한 각도에서 촬영한 CCTV 영상을 기반으로 제작되었습니다. 동시에 발생하는 상황을 보여드리기 위하여 때로는 2개의 영상이 같은 화면에 보여질 수 있습니다.

북한군 귀순자가 차량을 통해서 72시간 다리를 건너 접근하는 모습을 보실 수 있으며 공동경비구역 건물 주변에 차량이 박히는 모습을 볼 수 있습니다.

영상에서는 북한군의 대응을 볼 수 있으며 이후 군사분계선을 넘어 남쪽으로 도주하는 귀순자의 모습을 보실 수 있습니다. 마지막으로 응급처치를 위한 의무 후송을 위하여 JSA 경비대대 인원들이 귀순병사의 신병을 확보하는 영상 또한 보실 수 있습니다.

본 사건이 발생한 시각에는 남북 양측 모두 공동경비구역에 대한 투어는 진행되고 있지 않았음을 알려드립니다. 이제 영상을 보여드리며 각 화면에 대해서 제가 좀 더 자세히 설명해 드리겠습니다.

본 초기 화면에서는 북한 차량이 72시간다리로 향하는 모습을 보실 수 있습니다.

보시는 바와 같이 해당 차량은 상당히 빠른 속도로 이동하고 있으며 차량이 72시간 다리를 건너 이동함에 따라 주변 건물에서 일부 북한군 병사들이 뛰어나오는 모습을 보실 수 있습니다.

그리고 보시는 영상 왼쪽 하단의 시간을 보실 수 있습니다. 지금 영상에 보시듯 차량이 빠르게 이동하여 다리 쪽으로 향하는 모습을 보실 수 있습니다.

차량 운전자는 빠르게 이동하여 다리를 건너 김일성동상이 북한의 공동경비구역... (중략)

Lyrics:

Take a hit, shoot me down, shoot me down
I won't ever hit the ground, hit the ground
Playing dead, I'll never do
Gotta keep an eye on you
Patience is wearing thin, paper thin
Promises broke again, what a sin
But it only feeds my energy
So don't expect no sympathy
Smoke, fire, it's all going up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?
Smoke, fire, flares are going up, flares are going up
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Put an X on my chest, on my chest
But I'm still standing 'cause I won't forget
The hell on earth you put me through
I'll save myself in spite of you
Smoke, fire, it's all going up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?
Smoke, fire, flares are going up, flares are going up
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
White flag never going up, never going up, no, no
White flag never going up, never going up, no, no
White flag never going up, never going up, no, no
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no (wave my white flag)
This time I won't let go (won't let go)
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no (wave my white flag)
Oh, I won't go down slow (go down slow)
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Wave my white flag
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Raise my white flag, no

✎ His love of food was kindled in his youth when he tried his first oyster on an oyster fisherman's boat. He attended Vassar College, dropping out after two years. He went on to attend the Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1978. He first became known for his 2000 book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly. His first food and world-travel television show were A Cook's Tour, which ran for 35 episodes. He wrote two more New York Times bestselling books: A Cook's Tour, and The Nasty Bits. He has been noted as one of the most influential chefs in the world. He has a public persona that has been characterized by Gothamist as ""culinary bad boy"". His lesser-known writings include both fiction and historical nonfiction. Bourdain appears as himself in the 2015 film The Big Short.

Would you still love them just as much if you found out their secrets movie theater owners don’t want you to know? We’re going to unveil 10 movie theater secrets. 
In cinemas, many people can’t always keep their feelings to themselves and that’s normal. For example, a movie about cannibals called Raw appeared to be too hard to watch for a couple of visitors at The Toronto International Film Festival in 2016. The people fainted and one of them hit his head badly during the fall.
Digital devices can do everything on their own, and there are more automatic processes at a cinema than there were during the previous century.
Keep it in mind that in case there are some problems with a projector (the image is blurred, not centered, etc.), you’ll have to stand up and go notify a staff member in the lobby.
20% of the population, including Johnny Depp himself, simply can’t perceive those three dimensions. Harvard Medical School neurobiology professor Dr. Margaret S. Livingstone explains it could be due to stereo-blindness when eyes can’t see in 3D because of the way they are aligned. 
If you love cleanliness that much, try to visit the cinema in the morning and avoid going there on Friday and Saturday nights when a lot of other people go out to the movies.

TIMESTAMPS
The biggest part of the profit isn’t earned by ticket sales. 0:49
There’s a lot of piracy. 2:45
A younger audience can watch adult-rated movies. 3:35
Viewers cry, weep, and run out of the hallways. 4:11
Creative ways to sneak in food 5:19
Many people avoid 3D films. 5:57
If there’s something wrong with the picture, the projection booth worker won’t help. 6:58
Cinema halls are full of garbage on weekend nights. 7:38
People often fight at the movies. 8:32
You are being watched! 9:00

SUMMARY
-Theaters have to pay a lot to film studios in the first two months of distribution so they have to make their money out of concession. 
-The cinema staff members who manage to prevent movie theft get a $500 prize.
-The younger generations buy a ticket when two movies start simultaneously, and one of them is not R-rated.
-A movie about cannibals called Raw appeared to be too hard to watch for a couple of visitors at The Toronto International Film Festival in 2016. The people fainted and one of them hit his head badly during the fall.
-One couple stuffed a truckload of food into an infant’s car seat and went to watch a movie. A girl from put some pasta into zip-lock bags and brought them into the cinema with her. 
-3D glasses give you an illusion of being inside a movie and it drives your visual analyzer crazy.
-Even though a movie projector has to be programmed during the day, there’s nobody sitting in the booth when you watch a movie.
-A short break between two movies is not enough time for a cinema staff to thoroughly clean up a theater.
-Someone who loves to fight will always find a reason to do so. It could be that someone took someone else’s parking place, they talked on the phone during the movie, or someone is chomping too loudly. 
-Thanks to security cameras, movie theater staff can spot and kick out couples that go too far on their “loveseats”.

This video is about how efficient various reactions are at converting mass to energy (as we know from the Einstein mass-energy equivalence of E=mc^2). Antimatter is very efficient but it is not naturally-occurring. Chemical reactions like fire or explosions are very inefficient. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are better, but not amazing on an absolute scale. Non-rotating black holes (Schwarzschild) and rotating (Kerr) are by far the most efficient, due to their accretion disks and very small radius of their innermost stable circular orbits.

(AllHipHop Features) Where did all the time go? The one-time prince of the city is now big homie. Wiz Khalifa, 30, has evolved from a Pittsburgh spitter in oversized clothing into a certified boss with a unique penchant for crafting the biggest hits. Wiz has evolved tremendously right before our eyes and he continues to do so at a rate that behoves his age.

The next stage in his evolution is Rolling Papers 2, the follow up to his 2011 multi-platinum album. Topping the original won’t be easy. The climate has changed and a whole new crop of artists have come to rise to prominence and dominance. But, in this exclusive interview with Chuck Creekmur, Wiz seems unphased. A shot of liquor and a joint don’t hurt either, as the rapper-turned-mogul appears completely relaxed amid increasingly tense times. The talented Mr. Khalifa is now deep into training in MMA, has a wildly mature demeanor, and even scoffs at the pressure of churning out more hits. 

He tells AllHipHop everything from his relationship with his past (Amber Rose), his son (salute to Sebastian), his kinda sorta beef (Kanye West) and how he deals with the pesky paparazzi he knows are planted booby traps for him. Furthermore, he talks straight business and how he has evolved from that young man that got a big break on this very site into a titan of music decidedly in control of his life.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t0YSa3mwWns/sddefault.jpg,0.012181440158096258,0.0003190744781588373,38.17741935483871,0.0015593478529375435,0.012500514636255095,0.01405986248919264,2018-06-12,14:07:45,Tuesday,1,16,28,16,24,93,239,4,53,1,0,14,10,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.42373709574587,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Also the Escalade is RWD while the Navigator is 4WD. Pricing for the 2018 Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum 4x2 starts at $96,795 while the 2018 Lincoln Navigator Black Label 4x4 goes for $93,705.

When you buy a large Luxury SUV like this it’s about making a statement so you need a prominent front end. Lincoln has applied their new corporate grill to the Navigator. The Escalade meanwhile has been using the same front fascia for a while and it still looks great. Both of these top-of-the-line models are riding on 22-inch rims.

The Lincoln Navigator SUV is powered by a 3.5 liter twin-turbocharged V-6 that makes 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft. of torque. The Cadillac Escalade is powered by a 6.2 liter V-8 making 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of torque.

One of the concept ideas for this scene was to have Luke Skywalker REALLY there and fight Kylo in this big rage-filled epic duel. The idea was scrapped later on because Rian felt it was confusing since Luke's X-Wing was somewhat under water and possibly destroyed (however he could have written that it was fixed or ok) and that's what led him to the ending we got, where hopefully Luke comes back as a powerful force ghost...maybe with Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda to fight Snoke (who could return as a force ghost himself).

What did you all think of this scene? What about the scene that could have happened?

Thanks for watching!
May the force be with you!!!

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

My team and I worked hard on this film for a little over 2 years! Due to my school and work, the visual effects and editing took much longer. But in the end, the Force was with me and I prevailed. 

A huge shoutout and thanks to everyone who supported me and this project. Without you, it would have been impossible!

There are times, like when I'm watching a Logan Paul video or reading about Tide Pod challenges that the natural response for an older adult is to just overwhelming anxiety for next generation.

And, indeed, I've watched as bad ideas (much worse than tide pods) have taken over young people in a way I did not expect and am extremely stressed out by. I worry a lot about people who figure out how to capture this energy for their own gain and do not consider the responsibility that their power brings, or think that they are righteous when they are in fact leaning into culturally destructive ideas.

But also, I have found the level of responsibility pretty paralyzing. John and I have both been shying away from cultural criticism on this channel because, like, I feel more and more drawn to stability and that means compassion for people who are intolerant, but don't necessarily know they are. And I feel like people often (maybe rightfully, I don't know) get roasted for that kind of behavior.

So this video was a surface-level discussion of a deeper and more intense thing that I've been experiencing, and that is pushing me a little bit away from four-minute explorations of culture because:

1. I don't know if I have the guts to put myself on the line for things that I completely recognize I might be wrong about.

2. I don't know if internet-based, echo-chamber-riddled discussion about any of these things is actually helping.

Also, a thing I cut from this is how, just like genetic mutations usually do nothing, I believe we can freak out about cultural changes that actually have no real effect on people. And sometimes the changes are absolutely negative. The way brains are set up after new dopamine channels open around puberty to when the frontal cortex finishes developing in the mid-20s is a recipe for indulging in bad ideas, and individuals certainly suffer when that carries them to the wrong place. Culture at large can suffer as well.

But it can also mean great things...great change...great action. And that's how I'm feeling right now.

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote discovers a deadly
Sydney Funnel Web Spider! 

In Australia there is one species of spider that strikes fear into the hearts of many, and that spider is none other than the Funnel Web! Intimidating in appearance with their up to half inch long fangs, these arachnids possess a dangerous neurotoxin that is particularly deadly to humans. Without proper antivenin after a bite the Sydney Funnel Webs venom has been known to kill humans within hours. Yikes!

However after the start of an ambitious statewide antivenin program at the Australian Reptile Park no one has actually died from a Funnel Web Spider bite in over six years.

Get ready to meet the the owner of the deadliest spider bite in the world!

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Mini Eggs Mega Cake, I stacked pastel-dyed layers of Coconut Cake (soaked with honey lavender-infused simple syrup), iced it with Italian Meringue Buttercream and topped it off with assorted Cadbury Mini Eggs candy! I even added decorative purple and gold bunny cake toppers that I made with gum paste.

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

Gallagher wrote a diary of his experiences for the Big Issue under the pseudonym James Campbell when he first became homeless in May 2015 and continued until he found a new home in March 2016.

This short film was filmed in Manchester and features Molly Windsor in the lead role.

ABOUT RHOBH:
La La Land shines bright when Bravo Media's ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" returns for season eight. Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Lisa Vanderpump are joined by new housewife Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave and friend Camille Grammer for a season of lavish adventures, uncontrollable laugher and confrontations aplenty. Running her successful fitness and nutrition accountability business, newcomer Teddi moves through life with a strict ethos that she rarely strays from, even if this leads to differing opinions with some of the ladies. Friendly face Camille returns with a new outlook on life and is finally able to entertain the idea of remarrying, but when she struggles to get her ""sexy"" back, she turns to her friend Lisa Rinna for advice. This season, the ladies are busier than ever, juggling life at home and in the boardroom. In addition to wrapping production on her series ""American Woman"" and expanding her retail business, Kyle is at a crossroad when she has to decide whether to renovate or move out of the home where she's raised her daughters. Dorit gives herself just a couple months to re-launch her swimwear line, which proves to be a nearly impossible task. Erika pours herself into Erika Jayne's meteoric rise, back in the recording studio and opening up in shocking ways as she writes her autobiography. Meanwhile, Lisa Rinna is a focused ""momager"" to her two model daughters, who are poised to be the next ""it"" girls, but struggles to keep them grounded as they continue to travel the world and grow up very fast. Lisa Vanderpump is knee-deep in rescue dogs, as her new business, Vanderpump Dogs, continues to thrive, but will she be able to do it all once she also takes on editor of a magazine? From casual lunches to luxurious escapades, there's no doubt that living this large has its ups and downs, but these housewives have their famed zip code -- and then some -- in the palms of their hands.

====================

TRANSCRIPT:

The Falcon Heavy was first announced in 2011 at a news conference in Washington DC, but the idea had been floating around since 2004.

And the idea was pretty simple. SpaceX had the Falcon 9 rocket, which at the time had done a couple of test runs into Low Earth Orbit so they were getting a feel for what it was capable of.

And what they saw was it was a great workhorse to take cargo to the ISS, and satellites to low Earth orbit and smaller payloads to geosynchronous orbit… but there were some payloads that needed more power.

So… Why not strap a few Falcon 9’s together? Boom. Done. 

And that’s basically what the Falcon Heavy is, it’s three Falcon 9 cores connected together with a second stage and payload on the top of the middle core, giving it 27 engines total with 5 million pounds of thrust.

Falcon 9 rockets care called Falcon 9 because they have 9 Merlin engines on them.

Liftoff of this thing is going to be awesome. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a rocket this powerful take off but with SpaceX, the launch is just the precursor to watching them land.

So once it gets into space, the two side cores will disengage, turn around, and head back to the pad.

Then, we are going to watch two Falcon 9s land almost simultaneously. It’ll be like some kind of rocket version of synchronized diving.

The third, middle core will continue to push the dummy cargo into orbit before it disengages, turns and lands on a barge further out to sea.

So once all the first stage cores land, the fairing opens and reveals the dummy cargo, which in the case of this first test flight will be… you guessed it… Elon Musk’s personal original Tesla Roadster.

Never to be outdone in the PR department, Elon Musk announced in December that he was going to use this event to launch his personal Tesla Roadster into Mars orbit. Something he seemed to insinuate was just a joke, but… (show picture)

It’s not a joke. He’s actually launching a car into space.

Just to make it more fun, he says that the stereo on the car will be playing Space Oddity by David Bowie, though I don’t think you’d be able to hear it in the vacuum of space, but still.

And just to be clear, the car isn’t going to Mars, it’s going out to the distance of Mars, so it will circle the sun relatively along Mars’ orbit. For the next billion or so years, according to Elon.

Anyway, when the heavy goes into operation, it will be the most powerful rocket currently in use today, by a factor of 2.

And it will be 4th most powerful rocket of all time behind the Saturn V, the Space Shuttle, and the Soviet N-1, which had a tendency to explode. Every time. It never made it.

Because it had 30 engines. Mo engines mo problems.

This title will be taken back by NASA once the Space Launch System gets up and running, it’ll actually be more powerful than the Saturn V, but we’re still a year or so out on that.

The Heavy already has a couple of satellite launches scheduled, the Arabsat 6A communications satellite and Space Test Program 2 mission for the US Air Force…

There’s also a plan to carry a Dragon Crew spacecraft with two passengers on a circumlunar mission in late 2018. But that’s very speculative.

So they’re making a Big Falcon Rocket. The BFR.

The BFR combines all the power of the three Falcon cores in the Heavy with 31 next-generation Raptor engines, and a large second stage capable of hauling more cargo than the Saturn V and can land vertically, making it fully reusable.

The Raptor engines in the BFR use a liquid methane and liquid oxygen mix called Methalox as fuel because those are capable of being created on Mars, which is the ultimate destination of the BFR.

But the Raptors are also a huge step up from the Merlin engines because they work at extremely high pressure to burn more efficiently and provide more thrust.

The plan is to begin construction on the BFR sometime in 2018 and the first launch isn’t expected until 2022, but even Elon said that was optimistic.

So we may get a few good years out of the Falcon Heavy yet. But it all starts with the first test launch, which is what makes this so compelling.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tBWZkrYUtrw/sddefault.jpg,0.02708951344077801,0.0012355117893513565,21.925742574257427,0.0030398483134040795,0.028325025230129364,0.031364873543533435,2018-01-08,13:30:00,Monday,0,16,39,15,35,90,289,4,58,0,3,14,7,5,2,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.562928564104812,2,"['happy', 'surprised']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,{'person': 1},1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of things we know and accept about the royal family. We know all about the perfect curtsy and the proper Windsor wave. But there are a lot of strange family traditions that most of us just pretend don’t exist. Like, what is the last name of Prince George and Princess Charlotte? And for that matter, did you know that Prince Harry’s name isn’t Harry, and Meghan Markle’s name isn’t Meghan? There are rules that affect every action of the royal family’s life, including what they need to pack when they travel. Everyone needs to bring a change of black clothes, but only the Queen makes sure to bring a slice of cake with her. You know there are a lot of rules when it comes to throwing a royal party, but you might have forgotten that the royal family makes an entrance from behind a secret room hidden behind a mirror.

After a massive storm tears through the Hex Archipelago, you find five grizzled survivors in the water. As an act of gratitude for saving them, they reveal a secret – the island they were just on holds some buried treasure. But when the sailors try to describe the island, something seems off. Can you find the booty despite their strange instructions? Daniel Griller shows how.

I know that you’re already been thinking a couple of times to try false  lashes, but the struggle of applying them makes you wanna just apply mascara and call it a day.
I’m here to tell you that YOU CAN DO IT!
If you want to, of course.
Do you NEED false lashes? probably not.
But if you want them, I suggest you to try them on first when you have absolutely nothing  going on, like no specific event, nothing that pressure you.
Because applying false lashes requires a bit of time.
You will get better by practicing.
Watch this video, get  everything you need, then you can send me pictures and tell me how it went for you.

Thank you so much for watching !

English actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer and notorious prankster Sacha Baron Cohen is known for pushing the envelope with his original characters. From British suburban rapper Ali G to Kazakhstani journalist Borat, Cohen's antics have established him as a household name. But we haven't heard much from the controversial actor lately, which makes us wonder: why won't Hollywood cast Sacha Baron Cohen anymore?

Currently I only have a high level warlord and i'll be working hard to get a high level centurion. I also plan on making for honor troll and anti gank videos. P.S These are my For Honor Highlights

In the future I will be playing other game such as Tekken 7, Destiny 2, Absolver and many others! If you enjoy watching For Honor and the other games I mentioned please feel free to sub!

Special thanks to Spliced, Havok, ArchWizard CJ, Dear Gamer and EFB for inspiring me and motivating me to continue youtube through their videos",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFd2yd53HsU/sddefault.jpg,0.017777837052053186,0.0009335698376922154,19.042857142857144,0.004201064269614968,0.0187114068897454,0.02291247115936037,2017-12-27,14:00:05,Wednesday,2,7,69,7,40,40,499,1,76,0,0,6,65,2,1,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.617774587625385,2,"['neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

""It's A Sin""
(originally by Pet Shop Boys)

When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything, I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a
It's a sin, it's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school, they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything, I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a
It's a sin, it's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father, forgive me, I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything, I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a
It's a sin, it's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a
It's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a
It's a sin",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFltbGYU6jQ/sddefault.jpg,0.008667580461836584,0.00013875850951642057,62.46521739130435,0.00039817659252538073,0.008806338971353005,0.009204515563878385,2018-05-31,18:23:43,Thursday,3,7,11,7,11,30,92,3,22,2,0,4,3,1,0,3.0,7.0,"['Leo ae P|', ""It's a sin, it's a"", 'sin']","['Leo', 'ae', 'P|', ""It's"", 'a', 'sin,', ""it's"", 'a', 'sin']",True,"['leo', 'ae', 'P|', 'It', ""'s"", 'a', 'sin', ',', 'it', ""'s"", 'a', 'sin']",12,9,24,1,1,2,4,5.247397911566161,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{},0

On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Monday, April 9th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp discuss the following:

1) New trailer released for Solo: A Star Wars Story

2) New extended TV Spot released for Avengers Infinity War

3) Box Office Report    

4) New ‘The Meg’ Image Reveals the Massive Shark on the Prowl

5) Tim Miller’s ‘Terminator’ Reboot Gets a Release Date Delay

6) Live Twitter Questions

A new trailer dropped yesterday for Solo: A Star Wars Story. The second of the planned Star Wars Story series of films following Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the blockbuster will debut Alden Ehrenreich as the younger version of Han Solo, alongside Donald Glover’s Lando character. It is set for release on May 25th, 2018.

Disney has released an extended new spot for Avengers: Infinity War. The film is more than just an Avengers sequel, as it brings together nearly every character in the MCU to confront the most formidable baddie yet: Thanos. Joe and Anthony Russo direct both Infinity War and its untitled sequel Avengers 4, which were shot back-to-back.

Director/co-writer/star John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place soared to a whopping $50 million this weekend, serving as the third-highest opening ever for a horror movie, behind only the $123.4 million opening weekend of IT last fall and the $52.5 million opening of Paranormal Activity 3 in 2011.  

EW released a new image from The Meg, showing off the scope of the megalodon creature. They also spoke with Statham about his prep for the role, which included swimming with some real sharks. National Treasure and The Sorcerer’s Apprentice director Jon Turteltaub takes the helm for the sci-fi action adventure. The Meg arrives in theaters on August 10, 2018.

Per Deadline, Paramount has shifted the upcoming Terminator reboot back from a prime summer spot on July 26, 2019 to the prime holiday release the Friday before Thanksgiving. The film will now arrive in theaters on November 22, 2019.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tGMrBcfPCR8/sddefault.jpg,0.017393939053881934,0.0007125904064009698,24.409448818897637,0.0011221896163794798,0.018106529460282902,0.019228719076662383,2017-11-22,06:07:48,Wednesday,2,8,38,8,33,52,334,0,79,0,1,8,14,3,0,6.0,8.0,"['eras', 'Cr Dra']","['eras', 'Cr', 'Dra']",True,"['era', 'Cr', 'dra']",3,3,8,0,0,1,0,5.361626807866187,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Sounds pretty great, right? Here’s the bad news: 95% of people think that they’re self-aware, but only 10-15% actually are! Luckily, Tasha Eurich has a simple solution that will instantly improve your self-awareness. As a third-generation entrepreneur, Dr. Tasha Eurich was born with a passion for business, pairing her scientific savvy in human behavior with a practical approach to solving business challenges. As an organizational psychologist, she’s helped thousands of leaders improve their effectiveness, from Fortune 500 executives to early-stage entrepreneurs. Her new book, Insight, reveals the findings of her three-year research program on self-awareness, which she calls the meta-skill of the 21st century.

Thanks for all of your support. This wouldn’t have been possible without you all. Homework EP out now! 

The images of knights on horses and grand kingdoms all seemed like a fun backdrop for this song because of their immediate association with love and fantasy. I wanted the music to feel fantastical- playful & unabashed. Kinda like falling in love feels.

Foolish Thing Lyrics

Good morning, welcome to the kingdom! I’ve got my ducks all in a row. They’re exactly how I like them but now I’m afraid they’ve gone. Good afternoon! I’m losing focus. My soldiers are putting down their guns and I think, “Oh no, where did they go?” Maybe all this time… Maybe all this time I’ve been wrong. Falling in love was another foolish thing that I never really needed, but you were the first to change mymind. You’re knocking me off of my horse and here I lay, fallen and defeated. I’d leave it all behind for this foolish thing of mine. 
 
The jester sent his resignation and my tower is crumbling to the ground. And as far as I see, I would much rather be in the place you appeared. As if I needed a distraction! As if I wanted an attack! But a prince in distress needs a damsel to test what he always feared… I couldn’trun, I couldn’t hide, or look away if I tried to! Falling in love was another foolish thing that I never really needed, but you were the first to change my mind. You’re knocking me off of my horse and here I lay, fallen and defeated. I’d leave it all behind for this foolish thing of mine.
 
I’ll close the door. Put it to bed- my loneliness.
 
Falling in love was another foolish thing I never really needed. But you were the first to change my mind. You’re knocking me off of my horse and here I lay, fallen and defeated. I’d leave it all behind for this foolish thing of mine.
 
Falling in love, falling in love… With this foolish thing of mine.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tHZpWrL89Bo/sddefault.jpg,0.03299343876046405,0.00014823252221537407,222.57894736842098,0.0021298672928840587,0.03314167128267942,0.035271538575563484,2017-12-18,17:58:49,Monday,0,7,62,7,26,45,474,3,58,0,0,6,56,0,0,6.0,7.0,"['darren cries /', '', ' ', '', 'omework ep']","['darren', 'cries', '/', 'omework', 'ep']",True,"['darren', 'cri', '/', 'omework', 'ep']",5,5,19,1,0,0,0,4.502123891199036,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 1},1

In college, women’s hockey players are reporting concussions at a higher rate than male hockey players. In fact, female hockey players are reporting a higher concussion rate than nearly all sports sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In several studies, female hockey players have reported concussions more often than men’s college football, and at a rate that is comparable to men’s college wrestling and men’s college ice hockey.

Compared to sports like women’s tennis or women’s basketball, hockey is faster, played on harder surfaces, and involves more collisions, which partly explains the high rate of concussions but doesn’t account for the fact that female athletes are reporting more concussions than male athletes who also play hockey. In fact, several surveys have demonstrated that, besides hockey, female athletes consistently report a higher concussion rate than male athletes playing the same gender comparable sport (e.g basketball, soccer, softball/baseball).

The reasons why are unclear, but this video highlights some of the plausible factors, including: gender bias, reporting bias, differences in style of play (for example, body checking is allowed in men’s hockey and is illegal in women’s hockey), hormonal differences (progesterone is of particular interest to researchers), neck strength, and differences in the structure of nerve fibers called axons.

To help understand how these factors might influence the concussion rates, this video features interviews with University of North Carolina researcher Zachary Kerr and retired US Women’s Hockey player Josephine Pucci, who ended her career following several concussions. To hear her story of how she came back to win a 2014 Olympic Silver Medal while playing on the Harvard Women’s team, make sure to watch the video above.

To say that sequels are destined to be worse than the original doesn’t seem to be a fair statement, but it happens more often than not. For every Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2, there are a dozen Speed 2: Cruise Controls. However, once every blue moon there comes a film, so good, so powerful that may just be at the same level or even above the original. This is The Dark Knight, Aliens, T2 and now Blade Runner 2049.

Light them up
Light them up
Tell me where you are
Tell me where you are
The Summer nights
The bright lights
And shooting stars
They break my heart
Im calling you now
But your not picking up
Your shadows so close 
If your still on love
Then Light a match
Light a match baby in the dark
Show me where you are 

Oh love how I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh love tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
Cos I don't know how to love
Someone else
I don't know howto forget your face
Oh love god I miss you every single day
Now your
So far away
 
Its breaking me
I'm losing you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
Too many fights and we'd cry
But never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me
Your calling me now but I can't pick up
Your shadows too close and I'm still in love
The summer’s over now but somehow
It still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars

Oh love how I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh love tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
Cos I don't know how to love
Someone else
I don't know howto forget your face
Oh love god I miss you every single day
Now you're

FAQs

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, where I did loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! Nail videos are too difficult to film + I prefer makeup!
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? I am 20

Where are the best places in the state of Oregon?
To the untrained eye they are the places that have awesome economies. They’re the places in Beaver State where people have the best jobs, residents are all above average, and the sun shines the most.

However, here at HomeSnacks, we don’t trust the untrained eye and instead look to data to understand the best places to call home in Oregon.

There might be some surprises on this list, but when you look at the unbiased data, it’s hard to argue against.

After analyzing 73 places in Oregon, we came up with this list of the best places:

Lake Oswego (Photos | Homes)
Sherwood (Photos | Homes)
Brookings (Photos | Homes)
Sandy (Photos | Homes)
Milwaukie (Photos | Homes)
Tualatin (Photos | Homes)
Canby (Photos | Homes)
Silverton (Photos | Homes)
Bend (Photos | Homes)
Beaverton (Photos | Homes)
Follow along as we provide more insight into how we reached our overall best places to live in Oregon.

Mark Hamill has a few things to say about the scene as well which I thought provides some closure on the topic.

Black Panther is one of Marvel’s greatest warriors and fans will soon get to experience all of his full potential on the big screen. If you’ve been following Black Panther in the comics, then you know how many villains he has taken on over the years. Not only has Black Panther defeated villains and monsters from his own series, but he has taken on some of Marvel greatest heroes. In The Avengers: Infinity War, the Black Panther is part of a huge group of heroes who try on take on Thanos. In the Civil War II comics, he is actually one of the only people able to stop the monster from destroying the Ultimates. One of Black Panthers’ classic villains is Klaw, someone he has battled against time and time again. The Man-Ape is a classic villain from Wakanda constantly battling for the throne. Doctor Doom has destroyed countless heroes, but Black Panther has been able to outsmart him and defeat him in multiple comic book issues. Red Skull normally likes to take on Captain America, but his battle with Black Panther told a whole different story and included a violent ending. Erik Killmonger spent years despising the Black Panther and everything he stood for. This lead to a huge feud that has been going on for year and years. Nightshade has been a Black Panther foe on numerous occasions, but the Panther has consistently found a way to stop her. The Jungle Action hero has also taken on Namor, White Wolf, and the devil creature known as Mephisto. Watch to see all the super-villains Black Panther is capable of defeating!

He runs 26.2 miles in half the time it takes the average runner. Every year, the world’s top long-distance runners compete in the Berlin Marathon in a bid to break the world record (of two hours, two minutes, 57 seconds). Berlin’s generally flat course means that runners are more likely to break the record there than at most other marathons. And last year, Bekele came up just six seconds short of the record. Now, in an effort to achieve his ultimate goal, Bekele is training twice a day while exploring the limits of human potential and pushing his body to places few will ever know.

The Grammys started off strong this year with the first award of the evening, which was for Best Rap/Song Performance, and to literally NO ONE’s surprise, Kendrick Lamar, one of the evening’s frontrunners, took it home for his song “Loyalty.” Featuring Rihanna. 

Not too fast! That wasn’t Kendrick’s only award of the evening, and he actually won another four Grammys on top of that! During the live show, we all watched as Kendrick accepted the award for Best Rap Album, but before the show even started, he won in the categories of Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, AND Best Music Video! WOW.

Of course, as exciting as it is to see some of our faves absolutely kill it as they win one award after another, one of the most special moments of the show every year is when they announce the winner for Best New Artist, which recognizes music industry newcomers for their incredible contributions over the last Grammy cycle. But even with crazy talented nominees like Sza (prounounced: sizza), Khalid (pronounced: ka-leed), Julia Michaels and Lil Uzi Vert, Alessia Cara still managed to snag it!

We know… she kills it.

Moving on-- Even though Ed Sheeran was a two-time Grammy Award winner this evening, he was actually a no-show at tonight’s ceremony, leading some to believe that his absence had to do with not being nominated for any of the bigger awards of the evening. Regardless, he won for Best Pop Solo Performance for “Shape of You,” and Best Pop Vocal album for divide, which is definitely nothing to sneeze at.

And if you thought the pop and rap genres were the only ones to be represented during tonight’s show, you’d be wrong because Chris Stapleton also won BIG tonight. During the televised show, he snagged a Grammy in the category of Best Country Album for his latest release, From A Room Volume 1. He also received awards that were not televised, including Best Country Song for “Broken Halos,” and Best Country solo performance for “Either Way.”

And then came the end of the show, where we literally watched Bruno Mars make a clean sweep of all of the major awards for the evening, including Song of the Year, Record of the Year, AND Album of the Year, after already having won four others before the show in other categories.

Well, clearly, it was a HUGE night for Bruno, and considering that he was nominated alongside notable artists like Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, Lorde and Childish Gambino while his song “24K Magic” was nominated against hits like “Despacito,” and “HUMBLE,” it’s pretty amazing that he pretty much owned the Grammys this year, don’t you think?!

But, before we wrap this up, there are a bunch of other amazing artists who won tonight whose awards unfortunately weren’t aired during the show. Among them are The Weeknd, Portugal. The Man, Shakira, Childish Gambino, Little Big Town, Foo Fighters, and so many others!

Well, you guys… now that the Grammys are over, how are you guys feeling about the winners list? Is there anyone you were surprised about? Did anyone get totally robbed? Let us know all of your thoughts in the comments section below, and then click to the left to see all of the best-dressed celebs at the Grammys.

The brilliant and hilarious Deadpool 2 is currently showing in theatres around the world - and it's proving to be every bit as successful as the first movie from 2016.

Ryan Reynolds has absolutely nailed his role as the Merc with a Mouth yet again and the franchise looks set to continue for years to come as a result.

There were more cameos in Deadpool 2 than any other comic book movie that we've ever seen - and in this video, we'll take you through some of them. There are spoilers in the video (and in this text), so don't watch (or read) if you don't want to know what happened in the movie.

The cameos in question are; Ryan Reynolds himself voicing the movie's main villain the Juggernaut, a bunch of celebrities cameoing as the ill-fated X-Force team (including Brad Pitt as the Vanisher), the younger X-Men cast (including James McAvoy as Professor X and Nicholas Hoult as Beast), Alan Tudyk and a very heavily disguised Matt Damon as a pair of rednecks, singer Hayley Sales as Cable's wife Aliya, director David Leitch as a character credited only as ""Ground Chuck Mutant"", writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick as a news helicopter pilot and a news cameraman respectively, former WWE wrestler Kurrgan as Sluggo, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and Stan Lee (sort of) in bust form.

We hope you enjoy the video! Let us know what you thought of it by leaving a comments - and please don't forget to subscribe to CBR’s YouTube channel so you never miss our great new videos in the future.

baby it's 3:00 am
had you on my mind
and it's not the first time we've gone through this
wanting you more and more
i can't help but think of what we could be
(and baby if i could tell you)
baby if i could tell you, if i could tell you
how much i care, i'm in despair
are you still there?
(just tell me)
just tell me how we can make this work
how we can make this work


'cuz baby if i find a way, i'm sure of it this love won't stray
just give me a chance to say i love you
and i need you
now are you here to stay, or fade away like every other day?
you're the reason that i lie awake


baby it's 3:00 am
had you on my mind
and it's not the first time we've gone through this
wanting you more and more
i can't help but think of what we could be
(and baby if i could tell you)
baby if i could tell you, if i could tell you
how much i care, i'm in despair
are you still there?
(just tell me)
just tell me how we can make this work
how we can make this work

Hello everyone! The Medleycrew and I are back with the #2017medley, featuring every hit song and all the best music of the year! Nope, I didn't forget :)

Thank you so much to all of the lovely singers and friends who helped to put this project together - it's been 2 months in the making, and it came together in the most perfect way possible.

So grateful for all of your guys' support this year - I couldn't have done any of the things that I did without your help. Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season, and I will see you soon!

He would then have the most elite and powerful suit that technology could get him. Today's video goes over the concept designs of the BF4 game, showing us just the different types of suits we would have gotten that George Lucas and Lucasfilm would likely have accepted. 

If Darth Vader killed Palpatine with the help of Luke Skywalker and Leia, then his suit would take the form of these concept designs. What do you think of them and Vader's potential now?!

Lyrics: 
If I wasn't thin and white with blue hair would I be here? 
Maybe if I kill myself you'll know I'm sincere. 
I'll shave my blue hair 
Burn the rest of two dares 
Drop from 'parks 
Like ""fuck it, who cares?"" 
But I'll tell you: 
I resent the party scene 
With a part of me that's hard to see 
It's turned my starry friends 
To uninspired's lacking symmetry. 
Hey 
Look what you've done now. 
I'm fucked and hope you're proud 
While you follow around. 
So excuse my tantrum 
Can't you see I've got my hands full? 
I'm getting texts from idols I've looked up to since 15 
But now people use my friends to try to get to me (fuck you) 
But we don't know you and you don't know we. 
We're freaked out and fragile 
It's become more than a hassle 
But I'll tell you. 
Loud gets lonely. 
Loud gets lonely. 
Loud gets lonely 
But I've just got a couple more things to say really quick. 
To a certain married mister 
That tried to move on my missus, (Cam) 
Try to come around again 
You'll catch some swings and no misses. 
And to the rest 
I'll keep them nameless-nah fuck it, here we go: 
It's Richard and Clayton 
And John—shit, Will, yeah, y'all made it 
And if I see you in person 
I'm taking teeth 
Trust, you earned this.

So. This was started as a ""just for fun"" episode and was meant to go up late Sunday night. Then it didn't because reasons and when it became clear it was going to be overdue I made it longer and more ""elaborate"" to be worth everyone's wait... and then we had a blizzard here, so further delays. 

In any case, I'm sorry this is essentially up three days late, I hope it's enjoyed and if not I'm sorry the wait was for something that's more on the just-having-fun side. Next week's should be A.) on time and B.) non-frivolous (or at least as non-frivolous as this series gets)

A primer on London’s bright-burning young jazz scene, this new compilation brings together a collection of some of its sharpest talents. A set of nine newly-recorded tracks, We Out Here captures a moment where genre markers matter less than raw, focused energy. Surveying the album’s running order, it could easily serve as a name-checking exercise for some of London’s most-tipped and hardworking bands of the past couple of years. Recorded across three long, fruitful days in a North West London studio, the results speak for themselves: they’re a window into the wide-eyed future of London’s musical underground. 

KOKOROKO (meaning 'be strong' in Urhobo), are a collective of young musicians brought together by a love for Afrobeat led by trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey. They specialise in a soul shaking, horn fuelled sound with West African roots and inner London hues.

'Abusey Junction' is a ballad written by guitarist Oscar Jerome (fast making a name as an artist in his own right). It was written on the roof of a compound in Gambia where the band spent time last year immersing themselves in the soundscapes of the region.

Welcome to a new parody trailer! This time I edited a parody for the new Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom trailer! Enjoy!

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
In Theaters June 22, 2018

It’s been four years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment.  Isla Skraa now sits abandoned by stupid humans while the surviving dinosaurs and the huge godzilla fend for themselves in the jungles.

The end is near, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs (and godzilla) from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.

With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.  Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

Lyrics: 

Today is one of those I wish that I could frame
Or keep it on a video, replay it over and over
Just replay it over and over,
Cause right now
I'm feeling like I'm walking on a cloud
But I know what’s up's gotta come down sooner or later
Will i come down sooner or later?
I don’t know what tomorrow’s gonna bring 
But can you promise me one thing?

Don’t let me forget
Your hand in mine
The firefly drives
The time I feel asleep and you carried me inside
Kissed my head and said goodnight
When we were sparks
Just the start, our naive hearts had never felt that kinda fire that you and i were playing with
So don’t let me forget
Mmm mm
So don’t let me forget
Mmm mm

One day the sound of you saying my name 
Won't make my heart stop in the same way
That it used to
So remind me
How we used to 
Stay up late, sing those songs
That made us feel invincible when we were together
I always wanna remember 

Don’t let me forget
Your hand in mine
The firefly drives
The time I feel asleep and you carried me inside
Kissed my head and said goodnight
When we were sparks
Just the start, our naive hearts had never felt that kinda fire that you and i were playing with
So don’t let me forget
Mmm mm
So don’t let me forget
Mmm mm

I don’t know what tomorrow's bringing
All I know is I don’t wanna lose this feeling...

So don’t let me forget
Your hand in mine
The firefly drives
The time I feel asleep and you carried me inside
Kissed my head and said goodnight
When we were sparks
Just the start, our naive hearts had never felt that kinda fire that you and I were playing with
So don’t let me forget
Just don’t let me forget
Don’t let me forget, oh

Simone Umba - So news broke that Antman and the Wasp are getting released a month later in the UK due to the World Cup. I think its smart because it will keep it from falling under the radar but some UK fans are mad about the wait cause England will be knocked in game 2, Sounds like us during playoff season. Do you think Marvel made a smart move or ran the risks of spoilers?

Aliaa Abdel-Gawad - I am wondering if the success of Black Panther contributed to IW's record breaking opening weekend.  Using myself as an example, I am new to the MCU because of it, and I added it to my must see list because of the film.  Wondering if there were enough of people with my viewpoint to contribute to that factor. Agree? Disagree?

Justin Arana - Hey John. I'm a big fan of power rangers, I loved the new movie but understand financially didn't do any well as they would like it to. Now with Hasbro acquiring full rights do you think they'll take another chance?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tXEhwIN9u3A/hqdefault.jpg,0.03226763348714568,0.0012524719841793012,25.76315789473684,0.0077455504284772575,0.03352010547132498,0.04126565589980224,2018-05-02,21:46:48,Wednesday,2,15,44,15,44,82,331,3,65,0,1,12,19,2,1,5.0,7.0,"['A ‘ } r', '', 'MOHSWAdINW9 NHOf 3H.']","['A', '‘', '}', 'r', 'MOHSWAdINW9', 'NHOf', '3H.']",True,"['A', '‘', '}', 'r', 'mohswadinw9', 'nhof', '3H', '.']",8,8,22,2,2,2,1,6.639259209181957,4,"['happy', 'neutral', 'scared', 'sad']",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,{'person': 5},5

In order to stand out in the new marketplace, arcades began creating novelty experiences to bring gamers back into the fold. One of these experiments was “Mad Dog McCree,” an interactive, Western-themed arcade game, and one of the first of its kind to bring a live-action element into the gaming world. The end result? A game so bad you can’t help but love it. Twenty-five years later, we reunited with the original actors on the New Mexico ranch where the game was first filmed.

Join us as we delve into the untold stories behind your favorite video games with Great Big Story’s Emmy® nominated series, 8 Bit Legacy: The Curious History of Video Games. How did a game so bad become iconic? What does it REALLY take to become a Nintendo game master? And what ever happened to the Street Fighter II champion who simply disappeared one day?

You can try adopting the habits of super rich people and see how it will help you save money. 
Successful people are rarely night owls; they go to bed and wake up quite early. So this was the first habit I decided to take on. By the end of the first week, I noticed that I was able to do way more before noon than I could ever do during the whole day. One more week into the experiment I started waking up completely well-rested and excited to start a new day. Self-made successes swear by exercising every day for at least 30 minutes. After just 10 days, it already became a habit. I became more concentrated and calmer.
If meditating helps successful people stay on top of their game, it should help me out too. Networking is like currency for successful people. 
A lot of successful people (like Steve Jobs, for instance) keep a super minimalistic approach to fashion, often wearing the same outfit every day.  Truly smart and successful people control their expenses and don’t spend their money on useless things.

SUMMARY
-With will power of steel, I decided to wake up at the same time every day and come to work an hour early. It took me 3 days to get the schedule right.
-The hardest part here wasn't even the gym itself, it was exercising after working all day. After just 10 days, it already became a habit. I started sleeping better and waking up easier.
-Meditation turned out to be a really good way to get my head straight and renew my energy.
-Even though I didn’t manage to tackle all my tasks, I was able to do more things in the first week than I did during the entire previous month.
-I learned to find common ground with people from the get-go, met a lot of extraordinary individuals, and made some really good friends.
-I carried a book with me at all times and read it on the way to work and back home or during lunch. As a result, by the end of the first month, I had finished my fourth book.
-I no longer had to waste time every day choosing my outfit, deciding whether or not it matched or if it was trendy and whatnot. 
-I started out by making a list of everything that I bought every day so that I could see what I spent my money on. This system helped me save 40% of my salary in the first month and almost 60% in the second.
-New habits really did completely change my life for the better.

Don’t let a small fire turn into a big problem. Keep the Mini Firefighter handy to quickly and easily extinguish little blazes.

The compact canister contains a specially-formulated foam that expands up to 40 times its size to smother flames before they get out of control. 

With a simple shake and spray, you can extinguish multiple types of fires in your kitchen, car engine, campground, or even while riding a faulty hoverboard. Once disaster has been averted, just wipe off the residue-free foam and dispose of it in the drain or trash. 

It may not kick down any doors (or have a sexy calendar), but the Mini Firefighter will come to the rescue when you need it most.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Benjamin Zhang: So you may have seen this video of a Tesla Semi driving around California. We’re not exactly sure what it’s doing. But it’s real and you can see it in the flesh.

Matthew DeBord: I’m not sure what they’re doing either. I did see that video. I think, what’s going on is- I saw the truck when it was revealed in Los Angeles. And I think most of the trucks are being kept down their at Tesla's design studio. Somehow one of them made it up to northern California and I think it’s just going back and forth between Tesla’s headquarters which is in Deer Creek in Silicon Valley and Fremont which is where their factory is on the east side of the San Francisco Bay.

Benjamin Zhang: We know they can’t even build their Model 3 sedan, how the heck are they going to build the truck?

Matthew DeBord: That’s an excellent question. They have one factory, in Fremont, California which currently pretty well maxed out trying to build the Model 3 which is their new mass market vehicle. They hope to sell it for $35,000 one of these days. And then their other two cars the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV was just their as well, and I don’t think they really have room to build a semi truck in there. So you look at the situation, and they're supposed to be building a lot more Model 3’s at this point and they aren’t.

It’s a puzzling thing, why can’t Tesla, do a better job at its core -what should be its core competency- which is building stuff. They seem really good at, as you pointed out already, designing stuff, doing really dynamic and interesting reveals of the vehicles that they intend to produce. And then when it gets down to the nuts and bolts aspects which is bolting everything together and rolling it on the assembly line and getting it out to the customers they struggle. Folks are putting money down to buy this truck you know deposit the truck itself is going to be priced anywhere from $150,000-$200,000 I guess that general ballpark by the time they get around to actually building it.

Benjamin Zhang: Why are people plopping down this much cash for a truck that they can’t have?

Matt DeBord: Well, there have been some cynics out there who have said 'oh yeah sure sure sure these big companies are plunking down their deposits to eventually get their semi their Tesla Semis. And isn't just marketing? Isn’t this just a way for them to say hey we’re on with the green future, the sustainable future, we’re down with electric transportation. On the other hand you might be looking at the truck and saying well, it’s probably going to be- they’re going to operate it in a fleet context anyway that’s probably going to be cheaper to operate over the long haul then my diesel trucks are, if I have a central place where I can charge them up. It’s supposed to be a lot faster than a present-day diesel truck,

Tesla’s always distinguished themselves. You got to think about, how cool it is. Right if you get inside the cab of the truck it’s nothing like a traditional you know tractor-trailer big rig it’s nothing like that at all. It’s almost like the deck of a spaceship there are a couple big screens it’s all glass, the driver sits in the middle opposed to sitting off to the side. And they really kind of thought through self-driving aspects of the truck, the drivers' comfort, the drivers' safety, all kinds of things along those lines so I mean it looks like a pretty appealing product and it really doesn’t look anything like you know big rigs that are on the road right now.

Benjamin Zhang: But to wrap this whole thing up, in the grand scheme of things where does the Tesla Semi exist, in sort of automotive history?

Matt DeBord: Well nobody else is really is directly attacking this problem. Most of the big truck makers are going to stick- are sticking with the platforms they’ve got I mean they might be thinking about hybridizing the big diesels you know instead of making them full electric. Tesla’s going full electric and if they- if it is successful, it will be much more revolutionary and much more game-changing then doing the consumer autos.

This version of the game has been patched to support color when running on a Game Boy Color system. For more information on how to play this game in color, check out   https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1187/

I've always loved this game. I first got it when I got my Game Boy for Christmas back in 1989, and have played it so many times in the years since. I thought that the work that was done to colorize this was really neat and suited the game well, so I figured I'd record a video of it in case anyone else was interested. It does work just fine on a real Game Boy Color with a flashcart!

*The video was recorded using the GBC LCD shader in Retroarch to give it that classic old-school hardware look that we all remember so well.* 

Update:
Just in time for Game Boy's 30th birthday, toruzz has just released a brand-new colorized version that he calls Super Mario Land DX, and it's an extremely impressive update. Be sure to check out my new recording of it here: https://youtu.be/D2as4Z3WwMM

Mit Halloween wird das gleichnamige Franchise, das 1978 von Regisseur John Carpenter ins Leben gerufen wurde, fortgeführt.

Handlung von Halloween Returns
Erneut treibt Michael Myers – jene zwielichtige Figur des Grauens, die schon 1978 in Halloween – Die Nacht des Grauens für Angst und Schrecken gesorgt hat – ihr Unwesen in einer kleinen US-amerikanischen Vorstadt. Ehe sich die Einwohner versehen, bricht die verschlafene Idylle in sich zusammen und der mordende Wüterich lässt eine rote Blutspur hinter sich zurück.

[GALAXY S9 REVIEW]

In a world where companies are adding keyboards, rumble packs, even lasers to their smartphones, the Samsung Galaxy S9 might seem a little dull. Not only does it strongly resemble its immediate predecessor the Galaxy S8; it also carries much of the same functionality. So whether you should splurge on the Galaxy S9 will depend mostly on how old your current phone is … and how much you care about that camera. I’m MrMobile and I'm here to help you figure it out in the Galaxy S9 review, brought to you by Tech21.

In this episode of HACKED! we will have a closer look at the BLDC Motor of a hard drive. We will find out how it works and how we can use its construction to determine whether it spins clockwise or anticlockwise. At the end we will connect the Motor to an Arduino in order to use it as a rotary encoder.

Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Rihanna and Helena Bonham Carter team up in the action adventure “Ocean’s 8.”

Five years, eight months, 12 days...and counting.  That’s how long Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) has been devising the biggest heist of her life. 

She knows what it’s going to take—a team of the best in their field, starting with her partner-in-crime Lou Miller (Cate Blanchett).  Together, they recruit a crew of specialists: jeweler Amita (Kaling); street con Constance (Awkwafina); expert fence Tammy (Paulson); hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna); and fashion designer Rose (Bonham Carter). 

The target is a cool $150 million dollars in diamonds—diamonds that will be around the neck of world-famous actress Daphne Kluger (Hathaway), who will be centerstage at the event of the year, the Met Gala.

The plan is rock solid, but everything will need to be flawless if the team is going to get in and get away with the ice.  All in plain sight. 
“Ocean’s 8” also stars James Corden as an insurance investigator trying to put the pieces together, and Richard Armitage as Kluger’s unwitting date at the Gala.

Gary Ross (“Seabiscuit,” “The Hunger Games”) directed “Ocean’s 8” from a screenplay he cowrote with Olivia Milch, story by Ross.  Steven Soderbergh and Susan Ekins produced the film.  Michael Tadross, Diana Alvarez, Jesse Ehrman and Bruce Berman served as executive producers, with Milch co-producing.  

Ross’s behind-the-scenes team included director of photography Eigil Bryld (“In Bruges”), production designer Alex DiGerlando (“Beasts of the Southern Wild”), Oscar-nominated editor Juliette Welfling (“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”), Oscar-winning editor William Goldenberg (“Argo”), costume designer Sarah Edwards (“The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”), and composer Daniel Pemberton (“Steve Jobs”).  Based on characters created by George Clayton Johnson & Jack Golden Russell
Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Rahway Road production, “Ocean’s 8.”  Opening beginning June 18, 2018, in UK cinemas. The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

His face is recognized all over the world – the young medical student who became a revolutionary icon. But was Che Guevara a heroic champion of the poor, or a ruthless warlord who left a legacy of repression? Alex Gendler puts this controversial figure on trial in History vs. Che Guevara.

Meghan Markle should get ready to take notes, as we’re taking you inside the lives of British royalty.
 
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the British royal family, and her daily routine is amazing. For a woman in her 90s, she sure does have an amazing work ethic, and an incredible amount of stamina. You’ll love discovering the quirky things that happen in her day-to-day life with her husband Prince Philip, like what cheeky treat she enjoys before she has breakfast.
 
As we let you in on what really happens in a day in the life of royals, we also show you how two of the Queen’s granddaughters, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice spend their time. They both have full-time jobs but also make time to support their grandmother. Eugenie even does plenty of regular things, like standing in line for her lunch and getting her own groceries at the supermarket.
 
If you want to know where Harry and Meghan will live, or what family life is like for Wills, Kate, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte, then watch out video full of royal family secrets. We reveal what George and Charlotte love doing, and what Wills and Kate get up to once the kids are in bed!

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

I will point out all of the differences between my German flat and an American apartment.

Hi! I'm Kelly and I am an American who lived in Germany for 18 wonderful months. While I lived abroad before in Turkey and had done quite a bit of traveling beforehand, those 18 months in Germany definitely broadened my perspective of Germany, Europe, and even the US in so many different ways! I wanted to share my perceptions with you guys through YouTube so that maybe you can gain context to things you've heard about, or learn new information or a different perspective, or maybe this is everything you've heard before and further confirms your world view.

Hailing from Cameroon, Joel's first basketball practice in America resulted in all his teamate laughing at his kills set. I bet their pretty mum these days. His initial goal growing up in Africa was to become a soccer or Volleyball player ideally playing in Europe. It was at a summer camp that his athletisisim for basketball were first discovered and it would only take him a few short years to transform himself into NBA star. In one year her shot up from 6'9 to 7ft and his ruthless work ethic would allow JoJo turn those who doubted him into believers. Besides non stop time on the court he also closesly studied Hakeen Olajuwon a Nigerian born NBA player who also started out with ambitions to play soccer getting in on basketball in his teens. Just like Olajuwon who had been nicknamed the dream, Jo-Jo would call himself The Process, a nickname bestowed on his team that he would become the embodiment of. If your a super fan of 76ers it's likely that this is info you already know, what yout might not know is that back in Cameroon, Jo jo killed a lion with his bare hands at the age of six...

오늘은 흔한 영국 슈퍼마켓 디저트를 먹어봅니다... 먹어보니까 솔직히 좀 졸리 끔찍하더라고요! 솔직히 좀 더 맛있을거라 기대했는데... 편의점 음식은 어쩔 수 없나봐요! 저희가 이 디저트들 제대로 만든 버전이랑, 다른 고급 영국 디저트도 먹어보는 영상을 보길 원하시면 댓글로 알려주세요!

******************* ABOUT THE VIDEO ***********************

We have had a few fans suggest that we cut a chainsaw in half.  But cut it while its running at full throttle.  We first cut the chain while its running, then we cut engine in half.  Then we went to return the chainsaw, it was classic, ultimate chainsaw fail.  Cutting it in half and seeing inside was my favorite part, and I loved how the guy at **** reacted.

We do more than just cut stuff with water! We build stuff and do crazy stunts. Most of what our waterjet does is create useful things out of metal and plastic.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/toR3xdNQ88Y/sddefault.jpg,0.014884503295714594,0.0002738279187122264,54.35714285714285,0.000684569796780566,0.015158331214426819,0.015842901011207385,2018-05-11,08:35:00,Friday,4,8,37,8,32,44,332,1,76,0,1,6,16,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['OSEVELT', 'iOTEL', '', 'ui', '7', 'ears', 'CLT', '', '  ', '', 'NUE ae']","['OSEVELT', 'iOTEL', 'ui', '7', 'ears', 'CLT', 'NUE', 'ae']",True,"['osevelt', 'iotel', 'ui', '7', 'ear', 'clt', 'nue', 'ae']",8,8,26,0,0,0,0,6.413872184529141,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Film edited to make this video by Ash Thorp, an ALT-C Production.

This purely cinematic film is intended to stimulate your mind and senses, while provoking further thought about our passage and presence in this world.

BTS of me building 7,000 dominoes on the set of Katy Perry's Witness Worldwide live stream!) Here is Katy's reaction to the domino project I made for her 😊 Katy was so nice :) This was certainly one of coolest experiences I've had yet because of dominoes!

Here's the rundown: Katy Perry did a live stream for 4 days straight to launch her new album, Witness. An enormous set was built on a street in LA for her to live in with 42 hidden cameras. While she was sleeping, various artists came in and created a piece of art to keep the live stream going (otherwise it would be quite boring for people on the other side of the globe to watch Katy sleep for 8 hours haha). I was the #Domino Artist featured on the live stream and stayed up ALL night building 7,000 dominoes! Worth it though :)

Hey loves! So this #YouTriedIt video is very different in the sense that I did not anticipate doing a video like this on my channel at all.  However, given the recent events that have taken place surrounding Tarte Cosmetics and the launch of their Shape Tape Foundation, I could no longer hold back on expressing some of my thoughts.  As many of you may know, they launched two foundation formulas, one being the Shape Tape Matte formula and the other being the Shape Tape Hydrating formula.  In this video I discuss the limited shade range and give my opinions concerning the situation as well as a few realities of being a person of color in this day and age when companies are still not reflecting what has always been a diverse population.  I also discuss the possibility of them repackaging an old foundation formula that was used for their Empowered Hybrid Gel Foundation and selling it as the hydration formula of Tarte Shape Tape Foundation.  I did try my best to do a full makeup review in spite of all that happened and I also did a 9 hour wear test.  Be sure to watch in 1080pHD and I hope you enjoy.  I look forward to moving on to even more positive content on this channel.  Much love and thank you for your continual support.

Researchers suggest the behavior was sexually motivated. The adult male took the calf by the tail and dove deep underwater ... while its mother blocked the calf’s mother from pursuing its child.

Lions, rodents, and even primates have been known to do this, too.

SAVE THE INTERNET
Thanks to John Oliver there's a SUPER easy way to do this. Do you enjoy Netflix? If net neutrality goes away, our Internet bills go up and we give power to companies like Comcast and Spectrum to control what information we can access.
Here's what you can do - takes less than a minute.
1. Go to gofccyourself.com
(the shortcut John Oliver made to the hard-to-find FCC comment page) or google ECFS Proceedings Results.
2. Under ""Proceedings"", you will see a 17-108 link (Restoring Internet Freedom). To the far right of that, you will see ""+Express"" Click this link.
3. Be sure to hit ""ENTER"" (or return key) on your keyboard after you put in your name, so it registers. (They make it a tad tricky there.)
4. In the comment section write, ""I strongly support net neutrality backed by Title 2 oversight of ISPs.""
5. Click on Review, then Submit, done. - Make sure you hit submit at the end!
Copy & paste to repost this, pls., rather than ‘Share’-ing, as it will be seen by more people. (And if the ""CONGRATULATIONS everybody"" at the beginning confused you as it did me, it's utilizing a Facebook algorithm to make sure this post appears on more of your friends' feeds).
PLEASE DO THIS!!! Cable, cell and internet companies already have far too much power, this makes it so much worse!!!!! Please copy and SHARE!!!

I have a 2017 John Deere x739 garden tractor which is four wheel drive and also four wheel steer.  I've added a quick attach weight bracket on the rear end which holds up to six 44 lb suitcase weights.  You'll notice I have HDAP tires all around which I feel provide the best all around traction on snow, packed snow, and ice.  These are an aggressive tire, however I've noticed very little turf damage with them.  I'm using a John Deere 54"" plow with Superior Tech 9"" plow extensions which create a 72"" blade with steel edge.  John Deere uses a quick hitch system that contains two hydraulic cylinders that allows movement up, down, left, and right from the operator station.  

This same concept will work with any X4 Series tractor, many X5 Series tractors, and all X7 Series tractors.  In addition, this is also a similar setup to the 1 Series subcompact tractor models and 2 Series compact tractor models.  However, with those models you will use the loader joystick to control the up, down, left, and right functions. 

SAFETY FIRST!

Be sure to always plow snow in the float position!  Failure to do so could not only damage your driveway or tractor and plow!

Also, there is a locking pin on the plow blade which should be in the ""unlock"" position at all times while plowing snow.  Plow between low and medium speeds.  Failure to do so could lead to property or equipment damage and serious injury to the operator!

I'm super bummed that YouTube took my initial Reputation Reaction EVEN AFTER I chopped it up so it was never playing the full song or even 20 seconds of it....BUT THAT'S OKAY! I hope you got to enjoy my audioless reaction just as well haha. 

You guys HAVE to go out and buy this Taylor Swift magazine, it's SO awesome I kinda want to buy the vol. 2 magazine as well haha

Don't forget to comment #Awesomesauce below if you were able to join my livestream! That was so much fun wasn't it?! I'm also looking forward to decoding these songs for you all so make you're subscribed with Post Notifications (hit that bell!) so you'll be the first to see it!

I hope you enjoyed my half vlog half unboxing video. SPEAKING OF WHICH I'm considering starting a Vlogging channel because that sounds like fun! Let me know if you'd be interested in that at all. AND I'm also wanting to do more livestreams in the future and probably some Q&A's so make sure you're following me on Twitter! I usually update what I'm up to allll the time on Twitter and I've been loving the people who have been reaching out to me on Instagram as well! 💖

BTW at the end can you catch the part where I call out KIM AND KANYE for my reaction to This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things?! Oooooooh the tea!! haha she spilled it ALL and I cannot WAIT to decode that song!! It might be my favorite...or maybe Delicate....or I Did Something Bad... ahhhh I can't decide! Do you have a favorite? or even a top 5??

1) Will Ready Player One mark a return to form for Steven Spielberg?

2) Sony Passed on Purchasing The Entire MCU

3) New ‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ IMAX Trailer Teases Massive, Colorful Kaiju Fights

4)  Robert Eggers’ The Lighthouse adds Robert Pattinson

7) Live Twitter Questions

Warner Bros. released a new Ready Player One trailer yesterday, giving us an even better look the upcoming film that was tailor made for Steven Spielberg. Packed with 80’s nostalgia and a seemingly endless amount of Easter Eggs found in the new trailer – could this be the return to form for Steven Spielberg, who’s beloved films (mostly) came from the 80’s and 90’s?

In a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Sony Pictures back in 1998 passed on purchasing the entire Marvel character catalogue for a price described as “dirt cheap.” The characters that ultimately made up the current MCU, was offered to Sony by Marvel while negotiations were underway to bring Spider-Man to the screen.

AGREE / DISAGREE

A new Pacific Rim Uprising IMAX trailer was released online yesterday, showcasing all new footage from the upcoming sequel. Guillermo del Toro departed the director’s chair to focus on The Shape of Water, with Daredevil Season 1 showrunner Steven S. DeKnight taking on directing duties.

A24 announced yesterday that Robert Pattinson has signed on to join Willem Dafoe in the fantasy-horror movie The Lighthouse, from The Witch director Robert Eggers. RT Features and A24 are behind the project, which will head into production this spring from a script by Robert and Max Eggers, with a story set in the world of old sea-faring myths.

Amazon Studios and STX Films have released the final trailer for the upcoming dark comedy Gringo. Directed by Nash Edgerton, the film stars David Oyelowo as a mild-mannered American businessman facing crushing debt who ventures to Mexico to hand-deliver a formula for a revolutionary new weed pill to a lab.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Arnold Schwarzenegger has joined the cast of Kung Fury, the feature-length follow-up to the cult 2015 short that will star Michael Fassbender; with the trade reporting that Schwarzenegger will play the American president.

[ Samuel(사무엘) ]

Samuel successfully made his debut last year with his debut album ‘SIXTEEN’ and the first regular album ‘EYE CANDY’. As a beloved solo artist, he came back with his second mini album ‘ONE’ in about four months.
The title track ‘ONE (Feat. JUNG ILHOON of BTOB) is an electro house-based dance song, which was made in collaboration with JS and ChaKun under the leadership of Brave Brother, the head of Brave Entertainment. The straightforward lyrics that describe the desire of a couple to become the only one for each other are maximizing the mood of the song. The emotion of the song was well captured in the powerful and emotional voice of Samuel.

To see how students across the country really felt about school shootings, we put out an open request for students to send us their thoughts. Here are some of their responses. 

Gun violence, particularly school shootings, ranks among the most contentious issues in America. Since the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, mass shootings have again become a staple of the news cycle.

This school shooting is distinguished from previous ones, because students around the nation have rallied to organize for safer schools. Whether that means stricter gun control, metal detectors, regulating ammunition sales, or arming teachers, remains unclear.

In case you haven’t noticed, off-road trucks are a thing and they’re gaining in popularity.  No longer do you need to up-fit a garden variety pickup with aftermarket parts to accomplish the task.  Companies like GM are providing the opportunity to buy these serious off-road trucks straight from the factory.  Case in point: the new Colorado ZR2.

I only feature products I like, or want to try.

A little about me:

Sean Daniel is a man. A man of simple needs and desires. And the one desire, no, the one NEED, that stands above all is to spread the challenges, joy and intellectual stimulus of music to people of Earth and beyond.
Born on the mean streets of upper middle class suburban Chicago, Sean learned the ways of the world through the dizzying heights of success to the lonesome depths of failure and emerged with the promise of a better tomorrow reflecting in his eyes and fiery passion in his belly.
He plays and teaches guitar on his YouTube channel where he regularly releases original music and projects to the adulation of legions of fans, who often compare him to Chris Pratt and one time Ryan Reynolds. He’s currently in the market for a nice leather jacket.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzMOp6-lzoA/sddefault.jpg,0.023310300744747887,0.0013116311048090524,17.771994472593274,0.003004487095446991,0.024621931849556945,0.027626418945003933,2018-01-11,14:00:04,Thursday,3,6,31,6,20,27,210,0,31,0,0,5,0,2,3,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.369173906351899,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Plus, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split after two years of marriage. The internet was buzzing about the possibility of Jen and Brad getting back together. Find out what Wendy thinks.

Then, Fergie was slammed for her rendition of the National Anthem at the NBA All Star game.

And, Omorosa denied having sex with Trump, but Piers Morgan said she asked him to have an affair when they were both on ""Celebrity Apprentice"".

Which is better, horsepower or torque? Two words that are often stated in the car community, but often misunderstood. This video seeks to clarify the difference between the two, without silly analogies like ""horsepower is how fast you hit the wall, torque is how far you take it with you"" (which, by the way, is highly inaccurate). 

Torque is a force acting at a radius, while horsepower simply incorporates time into the equation. This video will discuss the differences, how each applies to internal combustion engines, how they relate, what peak torque and peak horsepower actually mean, and how to analyze torque and horsepower curves. Finally, what's more important for acceleration, a car with lots of power, or lots of torque? 

Let's get technical. With the context of an engine: Power = Torque x Angular Velocity. In imperial units, this translates to Horsepower = Torque x RPM / 5252.

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

Yes, this is a 100% acoustic titanium violin (except strings and bridge), the only one in the world like it, so of course I had to play David Guetta/Sia's ""Titanium"" on it, with a hint at the end of one of my next songs. Did you hear it?

Born to a large musical family, Rob gave his first solo recital at 10 years old, performed in the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on the Disney Channel with the Disney Young Musicians Symphony Orchestra, and founded a piano trio that performed actively throughout his teenage years. Rob has won first prize at numerous music competitions and has soloed with the Utah Symphony, Utah Valley Symphony, San Diego Chamber Orchestra, BYU Philharmonic, and BYU Chamber Orchestra.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U video game consoles. It is the 19th main installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. The story is set in Hyrule and follows amnesiac protagonist Link, who awakens from a 100-year slumber to a mysterious voice that guides him to defeat Calamity Ganon.

The title's gameplay and mechanics constitute a departure from the series' conventions, featuring an open-world environment, a detailed physics engine, high-definition visuals, voice acting, and the ability to play through the game's dungeons in any order. Announced in 2013, the game was initially planned for release as a Wii U exclusive in 2015, but was delayed twice prior to its release on 3 March 2017. Breath of the Wild was a launch title for the Switch and was the final Nintendo-produced game for the Wii U.

Upon release, Breath of the Wild received widespread critical acclaim, with critics particularly praising the game's physics-driven open world and gameplay that encourages player experimentation. The title is one of the highest-rated games of all time on review aggregator Metacritic, and has been deemed by several critics to be one of the greatest video games ever made. sheikah breath of the wild master sword prince sidon how to get breath of the wild dlc",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2GdXLMM8Y8/sddefault.jpg,0.009809903024853895,0.0005137756085029863,19.09375,0.0020353418336849075,0.010323678633356882,0.012359020467041787,2017-12-15,22:46:10,Friday,4,19,83,19,45,94,531,1,77,4,0,10,0,5,16,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.422868817036141,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Little things make a big difference.

For Practice Notes 36, I have a little fun with some well known piano pieces, and I modify them to flip between Major and Minor qualities.  Sometimes the change is as simple as raising or lowering the third, but sometimes it's a little more complicated.  I was just curious to hear what these sound like when only the chord qualities are modified, so I can hear the opposite in a way.  My notes on the music theory behind what is being played moves fast (and may not be totally accurate), but I just included it to have a reference for anyone interested in following it.
