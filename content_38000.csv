Lyrics:

surfing the snow
are you ready for
a revolution to show the way
seven more weeks until the day

because heart breaks come in an bend us the wrong way
places memory are changing into all things

doesn’t matter whats tripping you out theres ways to go
this is where we get carried away enough to start again

what I see
is nothing like before
dreaming is the home of the brave
future is the healing of pain

because heart breaks come in an bend us the wrong way
places memory are changing into all things

doesn’t matter whats tripping you out theres ways to go
this is where we get carried away enough to start again
doesn’t matter whats tripping you out theres ways to go
this is where we get carried away enough to start again

like a cannonball
shot across the floor
we have found a way through the darkest hour
like a cannonball
shot across the floor
we have little time for worry

doesn’t matter whats tripping you out theres ways to go
this is where we get carried away enough to start again
doesn’t matter whats tripping you out theres ways to go
this is where we get carried away enough to start again
doesn’t matter whats tripping you out theres ways to go
this is where we get carried away enough to start again

LYRICS
When I ride by myself
I don’t ever get no help
But when I roll up with her
Everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay
They never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her
Everybody calls me sir

Northern California
Same old Friday night
Tend to be invisible
Underneath these city lights
Then I met my baby
Felt like I struck gold
Now they treat me like royalty everywhere I go
When I ride by myself
I don’t ever get no help
But when I roll up with her
Everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay
They never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her
Everybody calls me sir

Oh oho oh ohoh oh oh
Call me sir
Oh oho oh ohoh oh oh

Ohoh oh oh oh

I ain’t goin nowhere
Unless he’s there with me
Cause I don’t stand in line no more
Admissions always free
He could break the law he could break your heart in two
But I promise that you won’t care when he smiles at you

Ohoh oh oh oho

When I ride by myself
I don’t ever get no help
But when I roll up with her
Everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay
They never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her
Everybody calls me sir

Oh oho oh ohoh oh oh
Call me sir
Oh oho oh ohoh oh oh
Call me sir
Oh oho oh ohoh oh oh
Call me sir
Oh oho oh ohoh oh oh

Ohoh oh oh oh

Every time we hit the streets it’s like a world premiere
She makes me feel like Sia swinging from that chandelier
Went from marginally famous to the top of the A list
And just for future reference here’s a tip Mr. Belvedere
Never judge a book by it’s cover
And never judge an ugly duckling by his mother
The frog prince got kissed
Her lips granted his wish
It’s a sad world when your net worth determines your lover, but
What would I ever do without you
Prolly wouldn’t have a clue without you
But one things for sure when I pull up with her
Don’t refer to me as Travie
You can call me sir

What would ever do without you
What would ever do without you
What would ever do without you
What would ever do without you

Call me sir

We haven't been to the park in about a month so it was cool to see how the Star Wars Land and Toy Story Land construction was progressing. We were able to get a construction progress update on the all new Disney gondola system, The Disney Skyliner. We also wanted to show what the park is like during Spring Break, so we went around to each of the rides to check the wait times. Every single ride was over 90 mins and went up to 160 mins! Before we left we made sure to check out the merch! All in all, it was a busy day at the Studios but it got us more excited for what's to come! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

Dr. Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people.

The Dr. Phil show provides the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television.

Olivier Rousteing, Josephine Skriver, Ming Xi, and Romee Strijd offer a DIY guide to sexy style. 

Earlier this year, Victoria’s Secret and Olivier Rousteing joined forces to create the VS x Balmain collection, making graffiti-covered T-shirts and ’70s rock–inspired finery accessible to the masses. While Rousteing’s in-your-face aesthetic translated into the lingerie giant’s edgiest collection to date, the designer reveals in a new video that you don’t even need to buy the collection to get its signature look. Behind the scenes at the brand’s Shanghai show, Rousteing delivered a crash course in how to elevate a basic tee into something exceptional. Utilizing items that you’re sure to have lying around the house—safety pins, beads, and a sharp pair of scissors—he transformed Josephine Skriver, Ming Xi, and Romee Strijd into the newest members of the Balmain army.

Segment Journalist:  Jamaal Finkley


Based on an original story by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Donald E. Stewart (Missing), the Entertainment Studios production takes place in 1892, following a legendary Army captain (Christian Bale) who leads a dying Cheyenne chief (Studi) and his family through dangerous territory, overcoming his reluctance to put himself in harm’s way for a man deemed by the U.S. government to be the enemy.


Taking on his own period Western with iconic filmmakers like John Ford in mind, Cooper hoped to “contemporize” the film, contemplating racial divides that exist to this day. “We know that the racial and cultural divide in America is groing wider by the day,” the actor-turned-auteur said, “and I hoped to possibly create a conversation about inclusion, because I think that’s what’s most needed in a polarized nation.”

Approaching the project, which was a “homecoming of sorts” for Studi, Kilcher and Bale — who appeared together in Terrence Malick’s 2005 period drama The New World — Studi reflected on the way in which the Bale character’s actions mirror present-day realities. In a sense, John Rolfe’s rescue of Opechancanough is more of a “publicity stunt” than anything else. “I think it was a good look at how our world functions and has for a long, long time,” the actor said. “The fact that someone gets some publicity points out of the story that we tell is very telling of the world we live in these days.”

Impressed by Bale’s ability to become “fluent” in Cheyenne for the film, Studi also was challenged to learn the language for the production. “This was my first time speaking Cheyenne, but I do have a whole lot of Cheyenne friends,” Studi shared, “and I hope to keep them.”

Premiering in Telluride before moving on to Toronto, Hostiles is the first major awards prospect for Byron Allen’s new Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures. Also starring Rosamund Pike, Jesse Plemons, Ben Foster and ubiquitous up-and-comer Timothée Chalamet, the film is scheduled for release on December 22.

It was January 23rd, 2018 on the beautiful islands of Hawaii. Chloe was fast asleep when she was woken up by her Mother who was running through the house and telling everyone to hurry up, quick get out of bed, and pack their bags.

Chloe was still groggy and half asleep, so she got up slow, stumbled into the bathroom, then headed to her sister's room to find out what all the commotion was about and what was going on. But, her sister was frantically trying to pack a suitcase for herself and her daughter, Chloe's niece, and she looked totally freaked out. She didn't answer, just ran around the room throwing things into her suitcase, totally distracted.

Chloe wandered into the living room, grabbed her phone and turned it on, waiting to see messages and new posts, but instead what she saw scared her half to death: ""ALERT - INBOUND BALLISTIC MISSILE/BOMB THREAT. SEEK SHELTER NOW."" And it wasn't just Chloe and her family, or just one of the islands, it was everyone in the state of  Hawaii - they all got that alarm on their phones, on TV and on the radio. The Emergency Broadcast System, and all of the alarms on the islands went off.

That sent Chloe into action and she rushed to her room to pack a bag - the whole time though, she and everyone else, really thought that this was it, that they might die.

Chloe's Mom's best friend actually had a bomb shelter under her house that was meant to protect them from any type of bomb or missile threat, so the whole family piled into the car - Chloe's sisters and Uncle and nieces - and went to their friend's house.

They ran downstairs into the shelter while her Mom and their friend started bringing supplies downstairs to prepare for the supposed missile attack - canned goods and bottled water, blankets and first aid supplies - panicked and frantic and frightened.

They turned on the television, waited for news and instructions, and, after what seemed like forever, a newscaster came on and told them, and everyone, it was a false alarm. A FALSE ALARM! And, while they were totally and completely relieved, they were also a little bit confused and angry! How could a false or fake alarm like this happen? How could they cause such a huge panic about a bomb or a missile, and have it last so long, and then just come on the air waves and just say ""oh, sorry - our bad."" The word was that someone supposedly pressed the wrong button. Wrong button?!?!

It was the scariest moment of Chloe's life, and probably everyone else's on Hawaii too - almost 1.5 Million people freaking out and afraid that they were literally minutes from being attacked. Missle defence.

And, even though it was so scary, ultimately it really helped Chloe appreciate all that was in her life, her family, her island, and to live every day with appreciation!

Amancio started his business in the ’70s: He made nightgowns and bathrobes with his wife right in their living room. Once, their German partner declined a huge order and the spouses decided to sell clothes on their own. Later, the company was renamed to Inditex and opened new clothing stores: Massimo Dutti, Pull and Bear, Oysho, Zara Home, Uterqüe, Stradivarius, Lefties, and Bershka.
In 2000, the famous Pandora charm bracelet was created: buyers were able to create jewelry of their own design by putting the charms they wanted on the bracelet. Since then, the company has been growing and the Enevoldsen family are one of the richest people in Denmark.
In 1969, the musicians from The Doors were recording the album Morrison Hotel. At about the same time, they accidentally came across a diner named Hard Rock Cafe, and their album was exactly in this music style. They made a few pictures in this cafe and then put the photos on the back side of the album cover. A year later, 2 Englishmen called them — Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton and asked them to let them open a cafe in London named Hard Rock Cafe.
At the beginning of the 1930s, Ole Kirk opened a company that made ironing boards and ladders, but he soon started making wooden toys. The word “Lego” consists of 2 Danish words: “leg” (play) and “godt” (good).

A Parkland shooting survivor on why teen activists won't be silenced: “We are teenagers who have nothing to lose.” - http://bit.ly/2qMGudJ

After surviving the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Hogg and his classmates became vocal activists in the fight for gun control. But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting.

Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics. In the face of intense media attention, the Parkland students are putting on a masterclass in how to deal with bullies.

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.

Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her Dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who - against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit - must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, “Tomb Raider” is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero. The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (“Ex Machina,” “The Danish Girl”) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”), with Oscar-winner Graham King (“The Departed”) producing under his GK Films banner. The film’s production began on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

“Tomb Raider” also stars Dominic West (“Money Monster,” “300”), Walton Goggins (“The Hateful Eight,” “Django Unchained”) and Daniel Wu (AMC’s “Into the Badlands”).

Shooting on location in South Africa and the UK, Uthaug directs from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet. The director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (“Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”); production designer Gary Freeman (“Maleficent”); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (“Skyfall,” “Gorillas in the Mist”); and costume designer Tim Wonsik (key costumer, “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”).
“Tomb Raider” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM.

Comedian and storyteller Bill Bernat takes on the difficult topic of clinical depression. Depression is common, but most people are hesitant to talk to those challenged with the condition. After his own experience, Bill realized how important it was to be able to talk about his depression and have a genuine connection with another person. Bill provides tips to the “bridge-curious” on what others living with this condition might find helpful.  Responsible for marketing strategy and operations for this fast-growing organization.

Led go-to-market (GTM) planning and execution in partnership with leadership team. Developed public relations design, and implemented, with agency. Coordinated event messaging, strategy and logistics for targeted events and large ones including Microsoft Ignite.

I love learning about people and their inner worlds. I work in technology marketing and I enjoy what I do. I meditate badly, but consistently. Creativity is another key wellness activity for me. I’m a mental-health awareness advocate and share positive messages about life as a comedian, storyteller, playwright, actor and speaker. I live well with bipolar condition most of the time and I’ve overcome a few things such as overeating, addiction (nine years clean) and social anxiety. My greatest joy is watching people who are struggling emotionally find ways to beat personal demons and get glimpses of inner peace. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-ft-8zlfXg/sddefault.jpg,0.01563678573524381,0.0005739451789320612,27.24438902743142,0.0010620132737346366,0.016210730914175873,0.01727274418791051,2018-06-11,17:40:12,Monday,0,12,66,12,38,82,518,2,79,2,0,7,0,1,5,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.349530124297588,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'laptop': 2, 'cup': 1, 'wine glass': 1, 'person': 2}",6

One thing’s for sure, she’s incredibly glad she’s not having Drake’s baby.”

On Feb. 12, 1984, astronaut Bruce McCandless, ventured further away from the confines and safety of his ship than any previous astronaut had ever been. This space first was made possible by a nitrogen jet propelled backpack, previously known at NASA as the Manned Manuevering Unit or MMU.

After a series of test maneuvers inside and above Challenger's payload bay, McCandless went ""free-flying"" to a distance of 320 feet away from the Orbiter. This stunning orbital panorama view shows McCandless out there amongst the black and blue of Earth and space.

I know. YouTube is getting flooded with everyone's reaction to this music video, but... hey, what the hell? why not jump into it? But hope I and Yoo-hoo offered you something special in this video :)
I only knew Donald Glover as an actor(I'm a really huge fan of Community), but I’m really glad that I got a chance to come across his music because he’s really talented and I appreciate his work.
Hope you enjoyed today's video! and don’t forget to check out Yoo-Hoo’s channel as well! :)

Things you don't know about this video: The weather in Hastings has been so nice lately guys. Since we're moving mega soon, all of our friends from London are coming and staying here for the weekend. I'm going to Mexico next weekend but after that we're planning on doing a garage sale (or at least the first of many home-sales) and I'm so sad we're starting to sale/giveaway/donate stuff!

We are in Hawaii, specifically Kauai for a week for our Babymoon! We have two months left until our little girl joins us so we're enjoying our time while we can! Day 1 and we awoke to the missile threat alert. We didn't handle the situation very well and realized how unprepared we were. Thankfully it was a false alarm and we hope that people don't disregard any future alarms in the future!

We also hid a treasure in today's adventure. It's valid for a Bear Butt Hammock! Whoever finds it is one lucky dude or dudette.

Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4YT7_b90lE/sddefault.jpg,0.0067205576781285605,0.0002230712514243582,30.12740384615385,0.0005630404182585964,0.006943628929552918,0.007506669347811515,2017-12-07,09:35:00,Thursday,3,9,38,9,33,51,334,1,79,0,1,6,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,"[': e', 'COWL G', 'HOLLY WOOD}', '', 'eres', 'as[l 3', '', 'rT Da']","[':', 'e', 'COWL', 'G', 'HOLLY', 'WOOD}', 'eres', 'as[l', '3', 'rT', 'Da']",True,"[':', 'e', 'cowl', 'G', 'holli', 'wood', '}', 'ere', 'as', '[', 'l', '3', 'rT', 'Da']",14,14,29,3,1,2,1,6.385442267804086,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'cup': 1, 'person': 2}",4

If this is true this would make him the first YouTuber to be featured in a SuperBowl ad - making YouTube history! We cannot wait to watch it on SuperBowl Sunday... how about you?

There were some cool pieces in the Launch Bay from Rogue One, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. But first we checked on the new Star Wars themed Magic Bands and had a cobb salad at the Brown Derby restaurant. Then we headed into the Launch Bay and checked out Grand Avenue afterwards. The walls have come down near the Star Wars Land entrance (Star Wars Land is still behind walls and very incomplete) so we can see the structure that will be the separator between the different areas of the park and Star Wars Land. It's pretty neat to see! We can't wait to see it when it finally opens! Then we checked out the muppets fountain, it's back! The Miss Piggy Muppets fountain is back and it's a fountain again! We also saw lots of new Star Wars merchandise and treats and then we called it a day. This was a great trip and it was exciting to see all the new things since the last time we were here!

WITH a house full of dummies, teddy bears and sippy cups, you’d be forgiven for mistaking Max for a young mother. But Max, 20, is a “little” who pretends to be five and lives with her “daddy” Johnny, 31, in Kentucky, USA. The pair have a DDLG (Daddy Dom, Little Girl) relationship and while they say that it isn’t a sexual thing for them, Max has a list of rules to obey, including no back talk and no staying up past bedtime - and gets banished for a timeout in the 'naughty corner' if she breaks them. And while Max stresses she is an adult capable of making rational decisions, she loves nothing more than when her daddy reads her a story before her daily nap or takes her to the nearby park to play on the slide and swings.

If you have a question, please read the description first! You might find your answer there :)



About my handwriting: Yes, I am aware that my handwriting has changed. It doesn’t look as neat as before, but this is my real, fast handwriting. My last one probably looked better, but it was a lot slower. I realised that the only reason I kept using that handwriting was because I wanted my notes to look good, and for me that was a wrong reason. So I’ve started using my fast handwriting, and even though it might look messier, it feels so much better. I don’t have to constantly worry that my handwriting isn’t neat enough for instagram, I can write my notes a lot faster, and I get extra time which can be used for actual studying. 
So I’m sorry if you’re disappointed because I changed my handwriting, but the main reason I take notes is because it benefits my studies, not because people on Instagram and youtube like to see them. Starting to care less about my handwriting has made me less stressed and anxious, so for me this change is definitely for the better.
I’m hoping you guys will support me on this! My handwriting is still legible after all. 😉

These are not revolutionary tips or anything, just some helpful techniques that I’ve picked up in my schoolyears☀️ Feel free to leave your own note taking tips below, and thank you for watching the video!

FAQ (will not be answered in comments):

Which grade are you in?
- I'm currently on a gap year after high school

Why are you studying if you're on a gap year?
- I'm studying for a math exam necessary to get into the course I want to study in university this year. I'm also self-studying biology and chemistry to get a solid foundation for the subjects I'll be taking in university, as well as to get some repetition so I don't forget everything I learned in high school.

Where do you buy (name of stationery item)?
- If nothing else is specified I got it from a local book/stationery store. Google the brands to see where it's sold in your country!

How old are you/where do you live/what's your name?
- I prefer not to answer these questions for privacy reasons. I'm on a gap year after high school/before university so that is a good indicator for my age, I'm from somewhere in Norway, and I go by the name studytee/Tee here on the internet :)

Can you send me your notes, or do you sell them?
- I post my notes on Instagram, and other than that I don't share/sell them, I'm sorry!

*Question/comment about my voice*
- I am aware that I have a child-like voice, but that’s just the voice I was given. This is my «natural voice», and if you don’t like it then your computer or phone probably has a mute button somewhere. There, problem solved!

LOOΠΔ [Go Won]

Each member releasing her own singles with distinct character to create their own universe, LOOΠΔ started with the introduction of HeeJin in October, 2016. With the debut of each additional member, and with formation of units under the name of LOOΠΔ, they grew along with their fandom all around the globe.

‘LOOΠΔ 1/3’, composed of HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul and ViVi, put together stories of innocence and excitement in the first crush of the girls in their music. Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry formed ‘LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE’ and take charge in their love.

Each unit pursuing their music as independent groups, ‘LOOΠΔ’ realized their idea of becoming one big group with many colors, and now, the eleventh member Go Won appears where Yves and Chuu have met after denying the Garden of Eden.

Go Won’s titled track ‘One&Only’ is about self-love.

Even when it feels like the existence of oneself seems irrelevant in the world and may feel very little among others, Go Won sings, “it’s not a coincidence that I’ve met myself” and emphasizes how she met herself, ‘one and only’, is precious.

The version of the ‘One&Only’ distributed online has been mixed in 3-D to stimulate stereognostic perception of the listeners when listened on either earphones or headphones. The CD version of the track will be the ‘original mix’ version as a perk for fans who purchase the CD.

‘See Saw’ the supporting track which is a duet of Chuu and Go Won, defies the typical grammar of the k-pop genre to expand the boundaries of music with the uniqueness of LOOΠΔ. Chuu’s refreshing voice along with Go Won’s adolescent voice create the dynamic balance like riding a see-saw.

Yves, Chuu and Go Won will soon meet the last piece of the puzzle to create their own universe of girls who escaped the Garden of Eden.

There are 20 health tips that are worth following and which are better left in the past. Do you still believe that humans have five senses and using a microwave can give you cancer? In that case, you will be surprised to see those and other health myths exploded. After watching this video, you will have a great excuse to eat at night. 

Myths:
Pregnancy lasts 9 months 0:36
If you are overweight, you are unhealthy 0:58
Organic food is free of pesticides 1:41
Honey is a natural sugar, and it's better than processed sugar 2:29
You can catch a cold because of cold weather 3:12 
Chicken broth is the best cure for everything 3:40
Eating carrots can give you excellent night vision 4:08
You use only 10% of your brain 4:53
Using microwaves can give you cancer 5:34
Yogurt can improve digestion 6:10
Eating at night will make you fat 6:53
Milk is good for you 7:39
Humans have five senses 8:20
Chocolate can give you acne 8:59
Blind people can’t see anything 9:28
You should always stretch before you begin exercising 9:56
Too much salt is unhealthy 10:34
Your tongue is divided into four parts 11:15
If you crack your knuckles, you will get arthritis 12:05
Only a direct blow to the head can cause a concussion 12:39

SUMMARY
- Each pregnancy is different. It turns out that only 5% of babies arrive on their supposed due date. 
- The death rate of an overweight person who exercises regularly is half of the death rate of a person who falls into the standard weight category. 
- There is a list of more than 20 chemicals that have been approved to be put in organic food production by US Organic Standards.
It must also be kept in mind that despite regulations, even organic food is susceptible to chemical flow from fields or nearby factories. 
- There are 64 calories in one tablespoon of honey and 49 calories per tablespoon of sugar.
- More people catch a cold in the winter as we spend more time indoors which is good for viruses because they can spread easier. 
- In fact, chicken broth makes you feel warm on the inside working as a placebo. It doesn’t actually cure anything. 
- The presence of vitamin A in carrots can help improve your eyesight, but it’s merely a myth that it can help you obtain night vision.
- Several scientists and experiments have proven that almost the entire brain is active during a person’s lifespan. The brain’s different parts are all responsible for our body’s performance, and 10% of the brain could not handle the functioning of your entire body. 
- Microwaves do not cause cancer, and this has been confirmed by some of the top researchers. If we look at the heating method of microwaves, we’ll see that they produce radiation that heats up the water molecules present in the food, thus making it warm. 
- The probiotics have slowly entered our systems, and they’re ruling it. These probiotics are said to be the “good kind of bacteria” which helps regulate our gut. However, when your body is already full of different kinds of bacteria, how can it be determined that it’s the bacteria coming from yogurt that is helping? 
- What and how much you eat and how much you exercise throughout the day and not the time of day when you eat that matters when it comes to weight gain and loss. 
- There is no association of milk intake with healthy bones and the prevention of calcium and Vitamin D deficiency.  
- Anyone who has seen The Sixth Sense is convinced that humans have only five senses. It turns out that we possess more than 20 extra senses. 
- Chocolate fans will love this. No, chocolate doesn’t cause acne. Too much oil, bacteria, and dead skin cells do. 
- Most of the blind people sometimes actually miss being able to see darkness. It’s incorrect to believe that blind people cannot see anything at all. 
- Stretching before a workout may make you less efficient. As per Italian researchers, overstretching before running or cycling may reduce your efficiency by as much as 5%. 
- There are some health conditions requiring you to increase your salt intake. Low salt levels can lead to the probability of diabetes, increased fat storage. 
- There are five tastes instead of 4. The fifth taste is umami, which is like the taste of glutamate.

Studies indicate that bickering about the hard work of keeping house, taking care of kids, cooking, and mowing the lawn can contribute to relationship problems and divorce. Going to restaurants and hiring out some of the work can help. This is obviously not possible for most people, but if you can work it into your budget, buying back your time is one of the most satisfying ways you can use disposable income. Also, there seems to be a bigger bang for your buck if you're NOT rich.

Chicago Cubs star Kris Bryant is an MVP, World Series hero – and of late – the ultimate prankster. In this latest prank, three fantasy baseball leagues thought they were being filmed for a “documentary on fantasy sports.” Yeah, right. Little did they know that the delivery guy was none other than Kris Bryant, “owner and operator of Kristio’s Pizza & Wings.”

Without giving away all the amazingness, our favorite character in the clip is an unsuspecting, nice guy named Cole, who just happens to be a diehard fan who named his newborn son Bryant. When Cole takes Bryant with the 5th pick in the fantasy draft, Bryant coolly walks over to him and hands him a Red Bull Limited Edition Can that features his image on it.

In the detailed report he provides examples of the sordid history of Robert Mueller. 

Rep. Gohmert stated on the show, “In a nutshell – number one, he [Robert Mueller] has done tremendous damage to the FBI by running off thousands and thousands of years of experience, purging the Islamic training material –as some of our intelligence guys say – ‘we didn't know what we were looking for. He blinded us of the ability.’ But, the other thing— he identifies people he doesn't like and destroys them –leaves terrible destruction in his wake.”

Lyrics:
2am, and I'm still breathing
Staring at my thoughts floating up to the ceiling
I'm swimming in everything you said
I'm thinking 'bout jumping in instead
I've got you skinny dipping deep inside my head

It's in the way you see
You know what I need
It's in the way that you're holding me, bringing me close
You know that I won't let go
You've got me on repeat (repeat)
You've got me in a dream (a dream)
I let my worries go soon as you come through the door
Thinking 'bout what it'd be like to be yours

Every time you move
You’re looking like you’re dancing
I think that you could have it
(Ooh-ooh)
Everything you do
I want to do it with you
Don't ever want to miss you

Woah, oh
You do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do

It's in the way you touch me
I don't know much about love
But I'll keep on checking my phone to see when you're home
Or when you want me to pull up (ah)
We're one in the same
You got me caught in a daze (oh, no)
I love it when you say my name real slow
All my love is your's

I'm swimming in everything you said
I'm thinking 'bout jumping in instead
I've got you skinny dipping deep inside my head
(Inside my head)

Every time you move
You’re looking like you’re dancing (dancing)
I think that you could have it (you can)
(Ooh-ooh)
Everything you do
I want to do it with you (with you)
Don't ever want to miss you",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8t5mqYO9Yc/sddefault.jpg,0.010199444527764029,0.0001277447604914613,79.84237074401008,0.00010825281090827492,0.010327189288255488,0.010435442099163764,2018-04-06,06:16:10,Friday,4,8,1,8,1,52,2,4,2,0,0,7,0,0,0,6.0,2.0,"['VTA ON weet', '', 'Alina Baraz', '“Hlating’ (feat.

In the epic finale to the Maze Runner saga, Thomas leads his group of escaped Gladers on their final and most dangerous mission yet. To save their friends, they must break into the legendary Last City, a WCKD-controlled labyrinth that may turn out to be the deadliest maze of all. Anyone who makes it out alive will get answers to the questions the Gladers have been asking since they first arrived in the maze.

Lyrics:
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
All ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
They're singing ""Deck The Halls""
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
They're singing ""Deck The Halls""
Not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
All the fun we had last year
Oh if there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back this tear
(Christmas)
Oh but it's Christmas day
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
Oh come home
Oh babe
You know I need you
Oh come home
I gotta have you
You know I need you
(Christmas)
Whooaa
I gotta have you
It's Christmas, Christmas,
Christmas, Christmas yeah

""Swim"" Lyrics:

I bet you feel it now baby, especially since we've only known each other one day but,
I've gotta work shit out baby, I'm exorcising demons got em running round the block now,

Location drop now,
Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now,
Oh what a cop out,
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out,

The waters getting colder, let me in your ocean,
SWIM,
Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,

So hard to ignore ya, especially when I'm smoking,
SWIM,
The world is on my shoulders, keep your body open,
swim,

Pop a couple pills in the daytime,
Heard you got a friend, what's her head like,
Probably should have fucked on the first night,
Now I gotta wait for the green light,

I don't wanna wait for no green light,
Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright,
Luckily I float at insane heights,
Luckily, luckily, luckily, yah,

Location drop now,
Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now,
Oh what a cop out,
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out,

The waters getting colder, let me in your ocean,
SWIM,
Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,

So hard to ignore ya, especially when I'm smoking,
SWIM,
The world is on my shoulders, keep your body open,
SWIM,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh,

Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open,

SWIM,

Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip,
Check your footing don't get caught up in the rip no,
I know I said I'd call, I never did no,

Swim swim, I can take you even though I've never been,
The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again now,
And I've been drowning for a minute your body keeps pulling me in, girl,


The waters getting colder, let me in your ocean,
SWIM,
Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,

So hard to ignore ya, especially when I'm smoking,
SWIM,
The world is on my shoulders, keep your body open,
SWIM,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh,

I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeh,

Out in California, I've been forward stroking,
SWIM,
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open,

SWIM.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mC9v5FaLt84/sddefault.jpg,0.03371907604188973,0.00023955981806485186,140.75430643699002,0.001297054608779053,0.03395863585995459,0.035255690468733634,2018-02-21,20:00:39,Wednesday,2,7,30,7,30,46,282,5,80,1,0,5,8,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.487266312902262,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

LYRICS
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you and you've got to

Make it on your own but, we don't have to grow up, we can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

Won’t admit what I already know
I’ve never been the best at letting go
I don’t wanna spend the night alone
Yes I need you
And I need to

Make it on my own but, I don't wanna grow up, we can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going and you know that

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

All you have to do is stay
All you have to do is stay
So stay
Yeah

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

This is definitely the longest vlog we have ever released – only because we met so many amazing people who came out to show their support and appreciation. We loved skating for you guys and we hope the #ShibSquad enjoys this video we put together!

Following is the transcript of the video:

With the announcements of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and Big Falcon Rocket, Blue Origin's New Glenn, and NASA's Space Launch System, it can be tough to tell one rocket apart from the other.

NASA’s Saturn V rocket was the pinnacle of technology during the Apollo era. More than 40 years after its final flight, it’s still the world’s most powerful rocket. But that’s finally about to change.

NASA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin are developing their most impressive rockets yet. Here’s how America’s monster rockets of the future measure up to NASA’s moon rocket

Saturn V - 363 feet tall
Falcon Heavy - 229 feet tall
BFR - 348 feet tall
SLS - 365 feet tall
New Glenn Rocket - 326 feet tall

At peak performance, the Saturn V could lift 310,000 pounds to orbit. That’s equivalent to the weight of 33 African elephants respectively (avg. African elephant weighs 9500 pounds.)

Some of these payloads are subject to change, but here’s an estimate of how much each rocket can carry to space.

Saturn V - 310,000 lbs (33 elephants)
Falcon Heavy - 119,000 lbs (12.5 elephants)
SLS - 286,000 lbs (30 elephants)
BFR - 330,000 lbs  (34 elephants)
New Glenn Rocket - 99,210 lbs  (10 elephants)

The Falcon Heavy will be the first rocket since Saturn V capable of sending humans to the Moon, though it won’t be quite as powerful. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket will compete with SpaceX for commercial satellite launches.

But the real monsters of the group are NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s Big Falcon Rocket. Both will out power the Saturn V and are designed to eventually launch humans to Mars.

Now, let’s check out the true test of a rocket’s power — its thrust.

Saturn V - 7.6 million pounds (42 Boeing 747s)
Falcon Heavy - 5.1 million pounds (28 Boeing 747s)
SLS - 9.2 million pounds (51 Boeings)
BFR - 11.8 million pounds (66 Boeings)
New Glenn - 3.85 million pounds (21 Boeings)

The Saturn V generated 7.6 million pounds of thrust at liftoff

That’s equivalent to the same propulsive power as 42 Boeing 747s

(referring to Boeing 747-400 model, which has 4 engines that produce 44,700 lbs of thrust each)

Before the decade is up, we can expect to see at least a couple of these rockets roar to life for the first time.

SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is scheduled for its maiden voyage in early 2018. NASA’s SLS will likely take flight two years later in June 2020, and we can hope to see New Glenn launch by 2020.

The era of monster rockets is fast approaching. Can you hear the engines, yet?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mD1_UdW4qqQ/sddefault.jpg,0.008291481095423103,0.0007385689042981923,11.226415094339623,0.0013391787113784205,0.009030049999721295,0.010369228711099715,2017-12-08,22:00:05,Friday,4,9,44,9,43,59,358,3,78,1,3,6,18,2,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.529795335955758,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

the move from a tiny town in texas to the big city was really hard for me. everything changed, the people, the sounds, the streets. but i can say with certainty that i am so happy i moved. la is really starting to feel like home, and i am really starting to feel like an adult (with the personality of a 7 yr old).

again, thank you for watching these videos. i leave to go to toronto to record my ep in a couple weeks, and every once in a while it dawns on me how much my life has changed because of these little videos i've been making since i was nine, at first just out of boredom. thank you for watching these things haha.

Typically cars are outfitted with larger gas tanks to break the drifting record. The rules also allow the car to stop and refuel. But BMW thought that was boring. BMW decided to refuel the car mid-drift. They pulled inspiration from fighter jets. They call the method car-to-car refueling. A custom fueling system was built for the stunt. The refueling car pumped 18 gallons of gas in 50 seconds. The biggest obstacle was connecting the fuel hose mid-drift.

Unlike a fighter jet, they used a person to fuel the car. It took three people to complete the task. The refueler hung out of the car via a safety tether. There was a slim margin for error. They practiced the stunt multiple times before their record-breaking attempt. During the attempt, they refueled five times. 

BMW broke two Guinness World Records:

1. Longest Vehicle Drift in 8 hours

2. Longest Twin Vehicle Drift.

“The Disaster Artist” is the true story of the making of the film “The Room,” which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies.” Tommy Wiseau’s cult classic has been screening to sold-out audiences nationwide for more than a decade.
James Franco directed “The Disaster Artist” from a screenplay by Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber, based on the book by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell. Franco leads the cast, along with Dave Franco and Seth Rogen.  The ensemble also features Alison Brie, Zac Efron, Josh Hutcherson, Jacki Weaver, Ari Graynor, and Jason Mantzoukas.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mE4lS7zmROw/sddefault.jpg,0.006733080154842497,0.00011925073843726492,56.46153846153846,0.000522868622378777,0.006852330893279762,0.007375199515658539,2017-11-25,13:00:04,Saturday,5,6,59,6,37,42,437,3,73,0,0,5,52,1,3,6.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.784910131460976,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

A CORPORATE high-flyer has traded in her high heels and glitzy networking events to spend her days training giant alligators and handling some of America’s deadliest snakes. For years, Shannon Saurage, 42, worked in the executive world as part of an HR company where she dealt with 700 employees daily. Now she spends her days with her own 11ft, 550-pound gator named Mr Cuddles – training, feeding, and even kissing the beast at Gator Country, a reptile park and rescue centre in Beaumont, Texas. Shannon works alongside her husband Gary Saurage, who opened the park in 2005, and acts as the lead nuisance alligator hunter for the state of Texas.

SUMMARY
- When you have an important level to pass or battle to win, and suddenly, completely out of the blue and at the most inopportune moment, there it is – an ad. Just turn on the Airplane Mode on your phone and the problem is solved!  
- Every time you connect to a new Wi-Fi, your phone shows you dots instead of the actual password letters on your screen. But what if you need to quickly connect the other device to the certain source of Wi-Fi and you don't remember the password? There is the app called Wifi Password Show. 
- You can create your own texts for any occasion possible! Just go to Settings, choose Phone, then Respond with Text and voilà – here you can make your own personal message that will be sent to your contacts. 
- Turn on a Guest Mode! To switch it on, simply tap the User icon in the top right corner of the quick Settings panel. Then tap Guest.
- If you enter *#31# you will hide the number for all calls. If you need it just for one certain call, you can type #31# right before the number you’re calling. 
- Audio Timer will allow your device to turn off all the audio at a certain time. This is available only to iOS users, though, and takes only a couple of quick and easy steps. 
- Another one of the coolest features that your iPhone has – taking photos while filming a video. This option is available for all the iPhone models from iPhone 5 and onward. 
- Tap the Share icon in any app, choose Android beam from the list of options, and then just put the devices together back-to-back. A couple more seconds and your mission has successfully been obtained. 
- If it is necessary, Android users can easily use keyboard or mice. This can be very useful if your display is damaged or if you just need to type a lot of text. All you need to do to attach a keyboard or mouse to your Android phone is a USB on-the-go cable. 
- ! The app is called Screen Lock – Time Password and it will make your phone’s current time (or any other option related to time) its lock screen password. Just look at the clock and unlock your phone with the current numbers.

SUMMARY
- Your brain is like a hard drive — the space is limited. Remember Sherlock Holmes? He couldn’t name all the planets of the Solar system — this was not because he missed school or something like that, but because he was too smart to have such irrelevant information in his memory. He deliberately erased facts he would never need. This is what your brain does: it protects you from overloading with information. That’s why all new data is stored in the short-term memory, not the long-term one. So, if you don’t repeat it or use it, you forget it very quickly. 
A German psychologist, Hermann Ebbinghaus researched the memory and its mechanisms. He described the Forgetting Curve which shows that just one hour after learning something new we forget more than half of the learned information. One day later we remember only about 30% percent. Well, you see where this is going. 
- There is a memorization technique called «Spaced repetition». To keep some information in your head for a longer time, you need to try to put it into your long-term memory. Forced memorization is not very effective in this case because your brain can’t make sense of the information quickly and form strong associations. Here it all depends on the reason why you are learning something. 
- To memorize something quickly, repeat the information right after learning it. 
The second repetition should be after 15-20 minutes. 
You don’t need to return to the information between repetitions — just rest and do something different. Let your brain relax. 
Repeat the learned material the third time after 6-8 hours. 
And you should have the final repetition 24 hours after the first contact with the information.

If ""Reality TV"" was Real Life - Shark Tank
After months and months of trying to get on Shark Tank Mahk finally got his opportunity.  He spent weeks rehearsing his pitch and watching old reruns of Shark Tank. He didn't like Mark Cuban much, only room enough for one Mahk in Mahk'Merica.  Mr. Wonderful might be too tough to crack. Robert Herjavec and Daymond John were the Sharks he thought would be the perfect fit for his company......Unfortunately they're not there so Mahk has to improvise, worst of all A-rod, Mahk's Arch nemesis, is a guest shark. This should go well...

Nothing More - Do You Really Want It (Lyrics)

Do you really want it? 

We say give me a high, oh god, give me a feeling because I've lost my reason
We say, give me a push through this concrete ceiling 
We say, give me a sign that proves what I believe in; a “psychic reading”
So I can shake these American demons

Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing's clear 
No one ever wants to change themselves 
That's the way things are 

All because we hate the buzzkill
Jaded when we need to feel
But we can change it all
If you really want it

Do you really want it?

You gotta bite the bullet until your gums are bleeding; grab the mic and scream it 
You gotta dig up the past to get passed this anxious feeling
You gotta get ripped apart to see why you’re breathing; to find your reason
So I can shake these American demons

Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing's clear 
No one ever wants to change themselves 
That's the way things are 

All because we hate the buzzkill
Jaded when we need to feel
But we can change it all
If you really want it
Then we can change it all...

Do you really want it?

So I can shake these American demons
Screaming screaming screaming


Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing's clear 
No one ever wants to change themselves 
That's the way things are 

All because we hate the buzzkill
Jaded when we need to feel
But we can change it all
If you really want it

Everybody wants to change the world
No one ever wants to change themselves

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

My Patreon Expense Report:
https://goo.gl/ZB7kvK

Calculation: 
The equation is a=(w^2)*r where a is the acceleration, w is the angular velocity and r is the radius.
First we must convert RPM to radians per second. There is 2(pi) radians per revolution and 60 seconds in a minute. So 10,000 RPM equals (10000*2(pi))/60, which rounds to 1047. We then simply enter these values into the equation. For our first calculation on space station v we get a=(1047)^2*0.455=498,775 m/s^2
Acceleration due to gravity equals 9.8 m/s^2, so if we divide our answer by that we can see that it is 50,895 times the acceleration due to gravity.

But as it turned out, it definitely wasn’t enough because we all needed to see the hilarious SNL sketch which spoofed the hit movie, ‘A Quiet Place.’ Only this time, the lives of our main characters were directly affected by Kanye’s twitter feed. Introducing… ‘A Kanye Place.’ 

In the sketch, the gang have to escape from the monsters that threaten their lives, so it is extremely important for them to be absolutely quiet. Unfortunately, the temptation to read Kanye’s wild tweets is just too strong, especially when they find out he’s tweeting from Chrissy Teigen’s baby shower. One of the group member’s exclaim QUOTE “Leave Chrissy Teigen out of this!” It is her outrage though, after discovering Jesse Tyler Ferguson was also in attendance, that leads her to yell out in anger, which then get’s her killed by the monsters, and as the group quickly gets smaller, Glover is left to experience Kanye’s TMZ interview all alone, which has definitely taken priority over the whole monster thing. Obviously. 

Obviously, this super relevant sketch was a huge hit for Donald Glover and SNL, and with his newly released track, ‘This is America,’ everybody can’t get enough Glover… myself, included. But how did Kanye respond to all of this?

Well, really well, actually. Kanye retweeted the SNL sketch with a few crying laughing emojis. I mean, it is pretty funny. You’d have to be lying to yourself if you couldn’t recognize the hilarity of it all. Kanye also tweeted out the new Childish Gambino song, so looks like it’s all love between the two artists. YAY!

Unlike the majority of fake homeless experiment and social experiment videos popular on YouTube, this video featuring a homeless woman in Seattle is as real as real can be. 

I have been trying to vlog more and I did my very best to capture the experience of meeting Manda for the first time, touring Seattle's sanctioned homeless tent encampments, and handing out Hanes socks with Manda to homeless people downtown Seattle. Because capturing vlog content is often challenging some of the footage is not the greatest but I selected clips on emotion over quality.  I feel it's important to bring you through the experience as authentically as possible. This video is far from perfect but it is real! 

A few months back Manda posted a selfie on one of my Facebook pages of her drinking coffee from her homeless camp. We became friends online yet I never imagined that I one day I would be at Manda's camp drinking coffee with her.  

This video starts off with the moment I met Manda in real life for the first time. Manda then takes us on a short tour of her homeless camp. I have huge respect for Manda. It takes a lot of courage to open up your life for the world to see when you live under a bridge homeless. 

We then meet up with a friend that works for the City of Seattle who takes us on a tour of Tent City 5 Interbay that is run by homeless people Licton Springs Village, a low barrier tent community that is a harm reduction model. 

The next day folks from Hanes flew out to Seattle to meet Manda and to give socks away to several of Seattle's homeless camps, the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC), and homeless people unsheltered downtown. 

If you want to connect to homeless people you need to listen to homeless people. Manda took control. She was a force of nature handing out socks and hard to keep up with. The passion Manda had to help other people was contagious. 

This video is an inside look into Seattle's homeless population and how homeless people survive. Throughout this video, Manda shows us why it feels good to give to others. Let's follow her lead and do all we can to help the hurting people in our communities.  Manda is living proof we can all make a real positive difference in our world!

About Invisible People: 

Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they're on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can't ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation's most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America's homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.

mQrij7m7uow,-m3L9lA5_tA,This Elite Gymnast Quit At The Height Of Her Career To Escape USA Gymnastics Abuse (HBO),VICE News,25.0,2018-03-28 16:14:13+00:00,"['Gymnastics', 'abuse', 'self-defense', 'olympian', 'career', 'US gymnastics', 'corruption', 'gymnast', 'sport', 'training', 'regulation', 'USAG', 'national tram', 'training center', 'ranch', 'Larry Nassar', 'sexual abuse', 'scandal', 'sexual misconduct', 'criminal', 'harassment', 'sexual harasser', 'Nassar trial', 'malnourishment', 'hospital', 'mistreatment', 'college gymnast', 'NCAA', 'humane', 'personality', 'medical care', 'nutritionist', 'practice', 'Elite Gymnast', 'VICE News Tonight', 'vice on hbo', 'Elle Reeve VICE', 'Martha Karolyi', 'Mattie Larson']",332588.0,3677.0,167.0,541.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQrij7m7uow/default.jpg,"Mattie Larson was an elite gymnast who was adored by fans. She was also one of the dozens who were sexually abused by USA Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar. 

""I don't think it's possible for someone like Larry to get away with doing what he did for 20-plus years if it's not in a corrupt environment and organization,"" Larson told VICE News. ""I just don't really see how that would work.""

Here's how the organization USAG works. Gymnastics isn't a popular high school sport like football, so the path to the top, the Olympics, goes through some 3,400 private clubs nationwide. Those clubs are governed by USAG, which sets rules about who coaches and what levels gymnasts compete. 

When gymnasts reach the very top level, elite, they're invited to ""the ranch,"" a gym in remote Texas that's also the home of legendary coach Martha Karolyi. From 2001 to 2016, Karolyi was national team coordinator — she effectively picked the world and Olympic teams, and so was the most powerful person in the sport. And she required the national team members to spend one week each month there, to monitor their fitness. The ranch was the site of much of Nassar's abuse.

At the ranch, ""The rules were never show any weakness,"" Jessica O'Beirne, host of the gymnastics podcast GymCastic, told VICE News. ""You don't talk, you don't giggle. You don't show a lot of personality. There's not a lot of food. You workout twice a day. There's not a lot of time to do homework or study. Up until February 2018, you could not bring a parent or chaperone with you to the ranch."" O'Beirne added, ""And the other rule was you had to see Larry for treatment.""

That's one way Nassar exploited the system, according to Larson. He would be kind to the gymnasts, and give them snacks — even let them make fun of their coaches — but he also let them compete injured. She would hide the pain from injuries from her coaches, but not from Nassar.  ""Like with him we would be honest,"" Larson said. ""But he never really like kept us out of competition. So they definitely benefited from him. He let us compete when we were super injured."" 

In 2009, Larson dislocated both her ankles and broke a foot at the same time at the ranch. ""He didn't wrap them whatsoever. I didn't get a wheelchair. I had to stay the rest of the camp crawling on my hands and knees."" She did upper body and core exercises while her feet dangled. What did the adults do while a teenage girl crawled around them? ""Nothing.""

USAG closed the ranch in January, after Simone Biles tweeted that she didn't want to go back to the scene of her abuse. Multiple congressional committees are looking into USAG, and the Texas Rangers are investigating the ranch. USAG told VICE News it’s “cooperating fully” with the investigations, but won’t comment on the ranch amid litigation.

Blac Youngsta grew up in severe poverty in the crime riddled streets of South Memphis. Raised by his grandparents, he started working when he was just seven years old to help feed his younger siblings. When an honest days work wasn't enough to pay the bills, Blac turned to scamming and slinging crack. Before reaching adulthood, he'd seen more than life time's worth of guns, jail time, and more. Prior to hooking up with Yo Gotti and CMG, he suffered from severe depression.

Everybody knows that cars are about horsepower and torque!  But what does that even mean?  What is Horsepower?  What is Torque? We get into the nitty gritty of force- talkin’ ‘bout Torque and ft. lbs., and we build up to the triumphant power we measure with horses. It's Horsepower! ...did I need to say horsepower?  We explore the relationship between horsepower and torque.   You’ll find out what all those dyno numbers mean, and why diesel engines can make a bunch of torque, but not always as much horsepower as gas engines.  It’s FORCE!  It’s POWER! It’s HORSES!  It’s SCIENCE GARAGE!

Bart teaches us how cars work by blowing stuff up and cutting things in half.  It’s a science show for the car lover who’s easily bored.  Join Bart as he explains the science behind everything automotive.  This is cars down to the atom.  This is Science Garage.

Then, ""The Real Housewives of New York City"" cast was trapped on a cruise from hell and Lionel Richie thinks his daughter's relationship with Scott Disick is a phase and he's waiting for it to end.

Plus, the couple who own the house used in ""American Horror Story” are suing the people who sold it to them. They claim they had no idea the house was used on the show, and didn’t know fans by the hundreds would show up daily to take pictures and even try to break into the home!

These optical illusions and hardest choices ever tests will surprise you how precise they are:

00:14 - Hardest choices ever - Test your personality.
Now you will face the hardest choices ever that a person can make in their life! It's a test, so you can't just pick both or make no choice at all 😨😰 If you're brave enough to know the shocking truth about yourself, then sit back and take the test. Tell me in the comments what you have chosen!
02:06 - Optical illusions to test your personality - Cool personality test.
04:35 - Personality quiz.
This tough and heart-breaking test will make you face your most terrible fears and choices. The rules of the game are very simple: you should choose your option and can't say just 'I don't know', 'I want both' or 'I want nothing of it'. How does it sound? Are you brave enough to face these hardest choices and be honest? Tell me in the comments which options you have chosen and if you were surprised to know the answer?
06:51 - Fun personality test - Are you a good kisser?
A fun personality test to check if you're all right with kissing😉 But no laughing! Kissing isn't only about biology, but rather about how comfortable you are with the other people. This short simple test will make you reflect upon what impression you make and how good you are at interaction with people. I never thought I can be a kind of insecure person, but now that I've had a little time to think, I see it's true. Tell me if it was all true about you!
09:22 - Fun quiz questions to reveal what personality type matches your type.
This truthful and precise personality test will reveal what kind of partner you're really looking for! Chill your brain and try to not overthink the answers so that they were the most reliable. If you feel the result and your real relationship are different, look deeply inside your soul: probably you're just hiding your true desires. But be careful and remember that there are no ideal people, and it's better to discuss your relationship and reach compromise together rather than look for a new partner.

TELL me IN THE COMMENTS which personality type matches you (09:22), I'm looking for a #RomanticDreamer :)

All the while, she's also solidified her career in show business. So, to celebrate all of her accomplishments thus far, let's take a look back at Emma Watson's journey since her first ride on the Hogwarts Express…

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mU95zf_7UOM/sddefault.jpg,0.014723023978685612,0.0004255476613380699,34.59782608695652,0.0007354573712255772,0.015148571640023685,0.01588402901124926,2018-03-20,05:09:03,Tuesday,1,9,35,9,30,52,306,3,73,2,1,7,14,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['a mela', 'eer', 'sy', '', 'Cra']","['a', 'mela', 'eer', 'sy', 'Cra']",True,"['a', 'mela', 'eer', 'sy', 'cra']",5,5,13,0,0,0,1,5.724063804096532,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Whether it's deck size, wheel size/hardness, truck tightness, or shoe size, a lot of people ask about which is the best for skating. Learn a little info and hear my opinions on the matter in this video!

It’s pretty rare that I ever leave the house these days without bringing some type of homemade treat because when I pack my own food to go, not only do I save a ton of money, but the reward of eating my homemade yummy food made with love, trumps anything I would get in a store! It can be a little strange at first, but the more you do it, the more it become second nature and part of your everyday lifestyle.

Camila Mendes, Josh Gad, and Kim Kardashian are just a few of the celebs who spoke out after the horrific mass shooting.
The deadly shooting in Parkland, Florida hit very close to home for quite a few celebrities. While many stars are sending their thoughts, prayers, and asking congress to do something about the current gun laws after the tragedy, others like Camila Mendes opened up about their ties to the community.
Camila reflected on the memories she had growing up in Parkland and tweeted, “Parkland used to be my home. My sister attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas when I was in elementary school there. It’s devastating that such a violent tragedy happened in a place that I’ve always considered safe, a place that I associated with such innocent, childhood memories. My heart goes out to all the families who are grieving the loss of a loved one, and for all the survivors who have to live with the trauma.”
Josh Gad, who grew up fairly close to the city tweeted that a friend of his was deeply affected by the tragic events. He wrote QUOTE, “Last night, I received a text while I slept that our friend’s son passed away from his gun shot wound. My grief for this family and the many others knows no bounds. I’m so sorry this happened. I’m so sorry our leaders are worthless. I’m so sorry we are bound to repeat this again.”
Meanwhile, other celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Gabrielle Union tweeted about the necessary action that desperately needs to be taken to stop this epidemic from happening.
Kim wrote, “We owe it to our children and our teachers to keep them safe while at school. Prayers won’t do this: action will. Congress, please do your job and protect Americans from senseless gun violence.” While Gabrielle tweeted, “Like thousands in South Florida, we sent the boys to school in Broward County this morning… there are no words to describe the despair, horror and anger. This does not have to be our collective reality. How many more? How many children must not make it home?”
Like Kim and Gabrielle, stars like Hailey Baldwin and Ellen DeGeneres also used their platform to bring awareness to this tragic event and to send their love to those affected by the shooting.
Hailey wrote QUOTE, “Sending all my love and prayers to the families affected in Florida. More lives lost due to gun violence.. I don’t understand how this is still happening after all the horrifying tragedies we’ve witnessed! My heart is in pieces today.” Ellen tweeted, “No words, no actions, no laws are enough until we end this epidemic of school shootings in our country. My heart is with the students and parents of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.”
Much like Ellen and many others out there, we at Clevver send all of our love to those who were sadly affected by this senseless tragedy. Thanks so much for tuning in, I’m Ava Gordy and I’ll see ya next time.

Kanye West is back and this time it's a little different. All in within one week he's shown support for President Donald Trump and that has a lot of his fans feeling some type of way, but some there might a method to his madness.

Although she makes use of a number of different bass models, she uses them all to great effect in creating memorable rhythmic bass lines with roots in genres as wide-reaching as Motown and punk. The surprising and fun work she has produced with bands like the Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club are instantly recognizable, and we hope that our dive into her repertoire inspires you to dig deeper into Tina's catalog and experiment, using her signature style as your guide.

Lukas Nelson and his band, Promise of the Real, are an American rock n roll group based out of California. Lukas first picked up the guitar at age 11 to honor a promise he made to his father and was able to teach himself the craft by playing along to classic Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jimi Hendrix songs. Lukas is building his following the old fashioned way by touring year round and delivering high energy performances to fans across the country, having performed with the likes of Neil Young, John Fogerty, Bob Weir, B.B. King, and Bob Dylan.

Just Outside of Austin Lyrics

Cedar trees, the morning air, the way the dew sits on her hair
So peacefully below a Texas sky
I think I'll leave her lying there
Take a walk I don't know where
Just bathin' in the sunlight in my life

I hear the sound of windy leaves
Summer birds are gently flowing
River's creeks and pools up form the spring
The music of the water on the rocks is getting louder
As I walk towards whatever life may bring

Just outside of Austin
High as I've ever been
Just outside of Austin
I think I fell in love with you again

I went out to play the other day
The city and and it's city ways
A time and place for everything you'd say
But I just wanna sit at home
Ride my horse or write a song
A little bit of weed and I'm okay

Those nights when it's just you and me
Or maybe soon we could be three
It ain't so bad a place to raise a kid
Or maybe we should wait a while
No need to hurry nothing
I'm just saying I'd be happy of we did

Just outside of Austin
High as I've ever been
Just outside of Austin
I think I fell in love with you again

Just outside of Austin
High as I've ever been
Just outside of Austin
I think I fell in love with you again

I think I fell in love with you again

We decided instead of a box fort to open a $100 Vs $10,000 SPY GADGETS EBAY MYSTERY BOX and see whats inside. We found lots of fun spy gear, spy toys and even stuff for a Fortnite box fort in the bay mystery box challenge. We also had a bunch of cool toys that we unbox. This box fort challenge was really fun and inspired us to try a 24 hour spy box fort! Subscribe to Papa Jake for more PG kid friendly & Family friendly video's with no swears! 😁✌🏻

About The Opposition w/ Jordan Klepper:

Are you a fan of the show Pretty Little Liars, but you just can’t find the time to read the books? If so, we’ll give you a sneak peak inside and discuss how the characters differ from the ones you see on screen. It might surprise you to know that some of your favorite characters should look totally different. Aria Montgomery is known in the books for being tall, while the actress who plays her is only 5’2! Hanna Rivers is supposed to be a brunette, and Emily Fields should be strawberry blonde. While your feelings about Mona Vanderwaal might be complicated, in the book it’s clear that this character is pale with light eyes and nearly white blonde hair. Let’s see if you look at your favorite character the same way after watching this video and discovering what they should truly look like!

 ***Read The Description***  

Lava flow at Kilauea volcano Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 

Panasonic GH5.
Panasonic Lumix G X Vario 35-100mm f/2.8 II POWER O.I.S. Lens.
Filmed at 200 iso.

Sennheiser MKE 440 Compact Stereo Shotgun Microphone. 

This isn't a technical review. There are plenty of those posted on Youtube. I'm just showing how well the GH5 handled the tricky lava flows that night and morning. The flow area was quite active and heat made me cut many clips short. 

I was trying out various focus settings so, there are times I keep the camera filming while changing compositions to show how well the GH5 adjusts.

Often I used the touchscreen to manually change the focus.
It worked great.

Also, the AFC worked great 99% of the time.
There were situations where the intense heat waves proved too much for that setup but, that's a tough situation for any camera and normally I'd use a different method.
Again, these were test clips. 

It was also very windy but, the dual I.OS. handled it just fine. 

I posted this in the 4K 60fps because it would be an injustice to render at 1080p. The 4K is spectacular in comparison.

The only editing was a slight increase in both the saturation and contrast. 5% - 10%.

The GH5 can be as simple or complicated as you want it to be. The filming options are endless. Beautiful images too.

Watch full screen and look for the intricate little changes in the flows.

61g lava flow.

Thanks for subscribing and watching. Many more videos to come.
Be patient. What I do isn't always easy.

My usual warning.
Do not attempt to do what I do.
I have 26 years of experience and I know what I'm doing out there.
So many things can go wrong for those who don't understand or can't recognize the dangers of a volcanic eruption.
Stay away and watch my videos instead. 

Having said my usual warning, let me add that this flow is accessible via bike and hikes of at least 8-9 miles round trip.
Expect large crowds of people. Be sure to carry at least 3 liters of water per person.  

Always use extreme caution at the sea cliffs and never walk out onto new land as it could easily collapse into the ocean taking you with it.
As the bench grows the immediate sea cliff will be vulnerable to collapse also.
I highly recommend you watching this HVNP safety video on safety at ocean entries.

http://lavapix.com/#/page/lava-viewin...

Also, it's best not to breath if you find yourself engulfed in the steam plume. If you think you will be in it often, be sure to wear a respirator or at the very least cover your mouth and nose with a shirt or similar when breathing.

2002年1月17日生、アメリカ合衆国出身。 幼い時からアメリカでダンスを習う。その後韓国に移り、11才の時に「SEVENTEEN」の練習生生活を経て、13才でヒップホップ ユニット「1PUNCH」としてデビュー。そして2017年、Mnetのオーディション番組「プロデュース101シーズン2」に出演して活躍の場を広げた。同年8月、16才（韓国数え年）でミニ アルバム‘SIXTEEN’でソロデビューを果たす。類まれな多才な才能を変幻自在に操り、ソロデビュー後さらに多くの関心を集める。今年16才という若さながらも、目を見張る実力と才能で魅了する男性ソロアーティストとして、唯一無二な存在感を誇示している。

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON SUPPORTER Jeff Bingham - Hey, John. With A Quiet Place breaking out in a *massive* way, how do you think Truth or Dare will fare now? We usually expect good things from Blumhouse these days, but this looks like a stinker for them, even though it'll make a cheap profit. The director does not inspire confidence. And I can't even with those Joker smiles.

Aaron Schmerold - Hello John, Aaron here and I just watched the Solo trailer and I'm super excited. In the trailer Woody Harrelson says ""there's a big shot gangster who's putting together a crew"" and it cuts to Paul Bettany's character. Could he be talking about Jabba instead of Paul's character and this was a good way to just trick the audience?

Steve Ron - Hey John big fan .

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the major men's professional basketball league in North America, and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. It has 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[2] which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[3][4]

The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1][5] The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.

The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.

The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.

The Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers, who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls with six championships, all won over an 8-year span during the 1990s. The San Antonio Spurs have five championships, all since 1999, and the Golden State Warriors also have five championships overall (2 in Philadelphia, 3 in Oakland).

Following is a transcript of the video:

First, figure out how much you spend each year, then divide it by 4% (0.04).

This is how much you need to save before retiring.

Once you know your goal, you can leave work as soon as you reach it. But to make this work you have to invest your savings.

You can survive for only 25 years on these savings alone. So if you retired at 40, you would have to start working again at 65. But there's a way to make it stretch even longer.

Continue to invest and earn an average of 5% on your investments each year, then you will have enough to live on for the rest of your life.

This is probably one of my proudest creations yet. While the video might simplify the process, it took nearly 30 hours of 3D design in SolidWorks CAD to finalize the design.

Stay tuned for the test video and a Questions and Answers video that will be on our vlog channel soon!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches.

Ziggy arrived at Connecticut’s Mystic Aquarium after rescuers from The Marine Mammal Center found her stranded in the San Francisco Bay area. MRI scans showed a brain disorder causing seizures, preventing a return to the wild. Despite treatment, symptoms worsened and fluid filled her brain. Ane Uriarte of Tufts University developed a plan for surgery. Vets had treated fluid filling into the brain—hydrocephalus—in cats and dogs. But seals had never been treated for the condition. Veterinarian Jen Flower reports Ziggy Star is now eating and swimming normally at Mystic Aquarium, where she inspires much affection.

(☞ ᐛ )☞ Hey megababes, how u doin (☜ ᐖ )☜

Do you have a Valentine this year? It's ok if you don't! 
I've never had a Valentine but I never really feel bad around this time of year. Valentine's Day actually makes me very happy haha I love all of the pink and red makeup looks (and chocolate) and I think it's just an overall very cute holiday! 
Remember, you can be alone without having to be lonely. (◍•ᴗ•◍) So don't feel too bad if you're single, enjoy being completely selfish pampering yourself and know this...I LUV U!!! ( ˘ ³˘)♥ 

Thank you for watching, and Happy Valentine's Day, angels!

Can you choose a wand and devise a strategy that ensures you will win the duel? Dan Finkel shows how.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

From Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television, A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE! is inspired by the holiday classic feature “A Christmas Story” and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway production “A Christmas Story: The Musical.” Marc Platt (“Grease: Live,” “La La Land,” “Wicked”) and Adam Siegel (“Grease: Live”) will executive-produce, with Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary (“Grease: Live,” “Anything but Love,” “Ira & Abby”) serving as co-executive producers and writers. Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “La La Land”) who composed the original score to “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” will compose several new songs for the LIVE television event on FOX.

Two-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick (“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “The Producers,” “Manchester by the Sea”) will star as the narrator where he will play the grown-up “Ralphie Parker,” who looks back with love and humor on his favorite childhood Christmas. Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker."" Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.

Everything in this video was created by me from zero in programs such as Premiere Pro CC 2017, Premiere Pro CC 2019, Adobe Photoshop CS6 and last but not least Wondershare Filmora.

The images were heavily edited by me in Photoshop CS6 then gave the images a touch in Premiere Pro and Filmora to give a new expression and feeling to this video. All you see in this video is the result of my hard work!
This video it's under fair use and it's not reused content, since it's all original content.
If you enjoyed this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe and why not, share it!
I spend a lot of time, working on this video.

Their decision to hide in plain site and deny deny deny for four years makes perfect sense and no sense at all to some people. Maybe it’s the times were living in or maybe it’s just that some years have passed and it’s now been more than five years since Katie’s divorce with Tom Cruise, their kids are getting older, their growing older as well, so maybe they are both just easing into something that they’ve had all along.

10. Hand in hand- The two lovebirds have been seen walking hand in hand along the beach in Malibu, relaunching all the rumors of a long kept secret romance. They have been seen celebrating Jamie’s 50th birthday together out in Los Angeles and leaving together. They have never officially confirmed a relationship, but plenty of eyes have seen and heard about them spending time together for years.

9. The gala- Reporters called it their official coming out when Katie was introduced by Clive Davis as he was giving a speech on stage at the celebration. When they called on her name, Clive even pointed out that she was sitting next to Jamie. But as soon as the camera zoomed in on her seat, it was empty, and only Jamie was sitting there alone. When the audience found Katie, she had moved to a different seat at an entirely different table. After the event ended Jamie left with friends and Katie had already been long gone. Who knows why they are trying to keep it such a secret, but humans have eyes and saw them giggling and whispering to each other and gazing at each other throughout the night, did they think nobody was around? We all wonder why these two are so weird when it comes to being together.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mrETK9FAny8/sddefault.jpg,0.006759377250817221,0.0013297135575378134,5.083333333333333,0.001551332483794116,0.008089090808355034,0.009640423292149149,2018-04-06,13:00:11,Friday,4,9,66,9,43,56,572,2,115,1,0,6,0,2,1,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.881237396906903,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

[GALAXY S9+ VS iPHONE X]

PART 1 HERE: https://youtu.be/rAOf1Wg_Rh8

To anchor a collaboration years in the making, Jon Rettinger and I chose a comparison that never seems to get old. That's right: for the ninth year running, it's Galaxy vs iPhone time as we put Samsung's Galaxy S9+ head to head with Apple's iPhone X! In this break from the traditional MrMobile format, I visit the TechnoBuffalo offices for a podcast-like debate with Jon Rettinger on the merits of iOS vs Android, FaceID vs iris scanning, and simplicity vs customizability. We evaluate the iPhone X and Galaxy S9+ across five separate categories -- and in keeping with TechnoBuffalo tradition, there are no cop-outs allowed: every category gets a score, and an ultimate ""winner"" is indeed crowned! At the end of it all, we flip the objective into the subjective with our own choices for which would find a home in our own pockets.

A comparison this big takes two videos to tackle, so brew up a pot of something hot and plant your phone in front of your face for Galaxy S9+ vs iPhone X Part 1 over at TechnoBuffalo, and Part 2 at MrMobile! Then be sure to subscribe to each channel so you don't miss the next big smartphone reviews from each!

2) Margot Robbie Says She’s Working on a Third Harley Quinn Spinoff

3) Box Office Report

4) Bryan Singer’s Queen Biopic ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ Halts Production

5) David S. Goyer in Talks to Direct ‘Masters of the Universe’

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

In a report from Variety, Quentin Tarantino’s still-untitled ninth film has finally secured a release date. The movie set sometime in the late 1960’s and having something to do with the Manson Murders, will now hit theatres on Aug. 9, 2019, 50 years to the day the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after actress Sharon Tate was killed. Sony will distribute the film, which at this time will open head to head with Disney’s Artemis Fowl directed by Kenneth Branagh.

In a recent interview with MTV, Margot Robbie revealed that she is working on not one, not two but three Harley Quinn spin-off movies and that she does not yet know which adaptation will move forward first.

BOX OFFICE REPORT

BUY OR SELL

20th Century Fox released a statement over the weekend saying they have halted production on the long-developed Queen biopic ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ due to the “unexpected unavailability” of director-producer Bryan Singer. However, THR reports that word is Singer failed to return to the set after the Thanksgiving break,” leaving producers nervous about the state of the production and talking about potentially replacing him as director.

According to a report from The Wrap, David S. Goyer, the writer behind the Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel, is in talks to direct Masters of the Universe for Sony after writing the most recent version of the script.

SERIES SUMMARY
The Alpha Jay Show reviews animation episodes, animated TV movies, cartoons, and other things as a main series. I have reviewed many things from Fairly Oddparents to SpongeBob to Teen Titans Go to The Amazing World Of Gumball and many more. Expect a fair, open-minded and non-pandering review of whatever episode I use. Bear in mind while I do use copyrighted material, it is highly likely that my content falls under the legal defense of fair use.

SHOW SUMMARY
Mordecai, a blue jay, and Rigby, a raccoon, are groundskeepers at a park. But these best friends are lazy and don't let their jobs interfere with their ability to have fun. While Mordecai tries to be responsible and do a good job, he's frequently led astray by his immature pal, who is totally without fear or shame, and has no boundaries at all. The friends often end up having to pay for their irresponsible actions as they usually get into more trouble than they anticipated. Their slacking off at work causes much chagrin for their hot-tempered gumball machine boss, Benson. -- Google Search

Delete them from your phone immediately to protect your personal data and extend the life of your phone. 
Their creators promise the apps will optimize your device, extend the life of your battery and protect your phone from viruses. Some of them are even supposed to be lie detectors and defragmentation devices.  In fact, all they give you is ads, and what they do is get access to your data and kill your battery. Considering the huge number of apps created every single day, not even Google can keep track and check the safety of all the new programs. So the security of your device mostly depends on you!

SUMMARY
-There was a weather app that allowed the bad guys to avoid two-step authentication and easily get access to banking information of those who installed it.
-Social media apps suck up so much of your device’s energy and kill the battery too.
-Optimizers don’t make your phone’s system faster, they just slow it down and bring you ads as an added bonus.
-Built-in browsers are mostly slow-working and don't have any protection from data interception.
-Hackers create their own antivirus apps, which can steal users’ personal data and even completely block the phone.
-You have at least two reasons two delete browsers from your phone: they slow it down, and require access to most aspects of the system, so they can even manage your calls. 
-You won't get more memory than your phone had initially, but will provide memory apps with access to your data. 
-Lie detector apps are about as useful as crystal balls, but they kill your battery and get access to your contacts and personal data.
-Defragmentation apps don’t work like promised. They can only analyze how much space certain programs take up, use your phone's resources and collect your personal data. 
-You will want to delete this app because it consumes tons of data since it’s full of ads and causes a massive drain of your battery.
-Battery savers and fast chargers can’t really change the speed of your gadget charging, but can give you endless apps even on lock screen. 
-If you don't want these apps to get access to all your data, avoid them at all costs.

With her son’s life in the balance, Gail and Getty’s advisor (Mark Wahlberg) become unlikely allies in the race against time that ultimately reveals the true and lasting value of love over money.

If you've been here before you know how much I love capsule dressing and I credit it with helping me to truly hone in on my personal style in a way that conventional dressing never did. To help you do the same, I'm going to walk you through a model 20 piece capsule and go over each piece I've selected and why, along with over 30 ways to style them. Please note that I've opted to exclude handbags but you can easily pair this model capsule with any handbag style you like. Also, like always I recommend that you take what I'm showing and saying here as just a guide to help you ultimately hone in on what works for you and your personal style. For this reason I haven't linked any of the pieces I'm showing but if you want to know about anything in particular, let me know and I can share the details.* Thank you so much for watching! xx Audrey

Step aside PUBG - there is a new game in town. Fortnite - the number one game to drop you on an island just to destroy EVERYTHING. Yet, the thing I've been seeing most fans ask lately is - where is the lore? It's true, the game doesn't look like it tries to give much backstory to your situation. Except I've found it. LOOK CLOSER THEORISTS! All you want to know is right there for the taking and today I'm going to show you.

CORRECTION: There’s incredible power to data in the hands of companies operating at immense scale.
It’s why there’s now a movement to limit this,
why companies like Digi.me, who I’ve previously mistaken for a data collection company, actually let users manage and safeguard their
information.

Bing is laughed at but it’s actually a profitable product, which demonstrates the power of the control tech companies can have.

*The end of this video includes a paid sponsored promotion. This company had no part in the writing, editing, or production of the rest of the video.

*Clarification: The top Bing searches at the beginning is from a satire website (although I suspect they're not far off from the truth) https://www.thebeaverton.com/2012/07/keyword-term-google-number-one-most-searched-item-on-bing-for-28th-straight-month/

Every night, it puts on a spectacular - and terrifying - show with powerful fountains of lava lighting up the sky. Our Washington Correspondent Kylie Morris has spent the week on Big Island.

After weeks of eruptions and lava flows from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii there are increased worries about the health threats from Volcanic Smog and 'laze' which are thick hazardous clouds containing hydrochloric acid and glass particles.

Kilauea on Hawaii's big island began eruptions at the beginning of the month. Scientists believe that the lava that has been flowing in a Hawaii residential neighbourhood since last week is magma that's been stored in the ground since the volcano erupted in the same area 63 years ago. Hawaii's business community has stressed that many tourist activities remain open, as do the island's airports.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mw3IKKWs2Es/sddefault.jpg,0.004812359366513496,0.0005189968360159665,9.272425249169435,0.002136335813368048,0.005331356202529464,0.007467692015897511,2018-05-30,15:19:27,Wednesday,2,7,40,7,25,47,329,2,52,0,0,2,4,2,0,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.633578479734354,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mxbfVJ2ykqQ/sddefault.jpg,0.01239320413451539,0.0001896039575516958,65.36363636363636,0.0009020551919883713,0.012582808092067086,0.013484863284055456,2018-05-08,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,7,37,7,32,38,327,2,76,0,1,6,16,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.231295774247623,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

He's provided a description of himself and his project.

""I graduated from UMASS School of Engineering in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems Engineering (Electrical Engineering plus Computer Science).  I have worked in the Toy Industry Inventing and Developing Electronic Toys and Games for close to 40 years now,

I live nearby in Northampton, MA and have kept in touch with the school.  I volunteer at the M5 lab and so far 3 of my 5 children have gotten a total 4 degrees from UMASS.  I had heard the library had a bunch of 3D printers, and I started stopping in there.  Dennis and the staff were super friendly and helpful, and I learned a lot about 3D printing.  I started to make some simple prints, and one of the things they told me about was Thingiverse.com, where people upload their creations for anyone to print or modify.

I have always loved to build things, long before the official ""Make"" movement came into being.  Although my degree is in EE, I have love mechanical things.  As a child my parents bought me a small steam engine, which I still have today.

A few months ago a friend told me about ""The New England Steam and Wireless Museum"" in Rhode Island.  I looked it up and found there was an upcoming event called ""The Yankee Steam Up"", where they fire up the many steam engines at the museum, ranging from tiny handheld engines, to huge industrial engines from many years past.  I hung around there for most of the day!  Many people brought their own model engines, some of which ran on steam provided by the museum and some on compressed air.  I saw a really ""cute"" one, and saw it was for sale - $800!  Yikes.  Then I got thinking - I wonder if there are any air or steam engines on Thingiverse?  Indeed there were!  I picked out one that looked particularly nice, and started have the crew at the Digital Media Lab print the pieces a few at a time.  After several printing sessions, all the parts were ready to be assembled.  I carefully wet-sanded the moving pieces so they would fit together and slide perfectly.  I ordered some really cool looking screws on eBay and got it all assembled.  I slowly applied compressed air to the inlet port, and it was off and running!

This particular engine is called a slide-valve engine, since the valve that controls the air to the piston works by sliding back and forth, forcing air first into the back of the cylinder (pushing the piston forward) and then into the front of the cylinder pushing the piston backwards.  The crank then turns that back and forth motion into rotary motion turning the flywheel.  It could operate from either compress air or steam;  I chose compressed air as it was more easily accessible.  This is essentially how steam trains work.

I am now working on a simpler engine called a ""Wobbler Engine"" where the air to the piston is controlled by the cylinder ""wobbling"" back and forth.

Neither engine has enough power to be useful at doing any work, it's just the fun of building it and seeing it work, although I did consider trying to attach a tiny generator and light an LED!""

The Digital Media Lab is a multimedia and 3D print production space designed to support students working on video, audio, animation and 3D modeling.  The Digital Media Lab is on the 3rd Floor of W.E.B. Du Bois Library at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Over the weekend, rumors spread that this year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai would be Alessandra Ambrosio's last one ever. Though reports yesterday appeared to confirm the news, the VS Angel refrained from publicly addressing the news herself on social media—until now. In an emotional Instagram post this morning, the model said goodbye to the VSFS, after walking 17 shows. ""Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have been working for this amazing brand that inspires me and women all over the world,"" Ambrosio, 36, wrote. ""In my wildest dreams I would have never imagined doing 17 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows."" She thanked VSFS executive producer Ed Razek and her ""Victoria’s Secret family"" for ""making these memories unforgettable,"" but the hardest goodbye was to her fellow Victoria's Secret Angels, who include Adriana Lima (who's walked since 1999), Lily Aldridge, Candice Swanepoel, and more. ""Last night was so emotional to say goodbye to my #angel sisters but we put on the biggest and best show ever,"" Ambrosio continued. ""I could not have done this without all the love and support from my fans. It gives me great pride to be part the Victoria’s Secret movement!

안녕하세요 오늘은 카라멜 버터크림을 준비했어요 
카라멜맛이 은은하게 난 버터크림에 카라멜 소스로 데코했어요 
시트는 바닐라 시트입니다 :) 버터크림이라 많이 먹으면 느끼하겠지만 적당히 드시기에 좋아요 부드럽고 맛있어요 

카라멜 소스는 설탕 시럽이 갈색이 되면 생크림을 3번 나눠 붓고 4분 정도 더 끓여주세요 
카라멜 소스는 500ml 좀 넘게 완성됩니다 크림에는 250g만 넣었어요 
버터크림에 소스를 넣을 때 소스가 뜨겁거나 따뜻하면 버터가 다 녹아버리니 차게 만들어 넣어주세요 

버터크림에 카라멜을 넣고 충분히 휘핑을 해야 느끼하지 않은 버터크림이 완성됩니다 
밝은 색이 되도록 오래 휘핑해주세요 !
그리고 시트를 만들 때 계란을 넣고 충분히 오래 휘핑해주세요 !

데코에 쓰인 버터크림은 아이싱 하고 남은 버터크림을 얼려서 스쿱으로 퍼서 데코했습니다
케이크시트는 완전히 식혀서 잘라주세요 
데코는 본인 마음대로 하시면 됩니다 :)아이싱이 서툴러요 양해 부탁드립니다

Description:

Everyone’s eyes have been on Meghan Markle since she started dating Prince Harry. It’s been even worse since they got engaged. There are so many rules that come with the crown. And she’s actually already broken a few. Here are 10 Rules Meghan Markle Has to Follow and 5 She’s Already Broken.

For instance, the royal family is not allowed to play Monopoly. Reportedly, the game gets too intense. Fighting over a child’s game is probably not the way that the family wants to be seen. So they just nixed the game altogether. That didn’t stop this future royal from passing Go and collecting $200!

Meghan must be constantly watching the Queen. When the Queen stands, she has to stand. When the Queen finishes eating, everyone must be finished eating. It doesn’t matter if Meghan is halfway through her meal or just began. When the Queen is done, she has to put down her utensils also.

Meghan must stop taking selfies in public. Not that she does it too often, but we are all guilty of taking a selfie or two. This, however, is not the image that the royal family wants to portray. So from now on, all selfies will be for private use only. Sad news for all of us who follow her Instagram account.

Whether it’s the way to wear her crown or how she holds her hands when she drinks tea, there are so many rules to follow. Stay tuned to 10 Rules Meghan Markle Has to Follow and 5 She’s Already Broken to find out what cardinal rule she broke before she even met Harry.

FAQ: http://bit.ly/2u9uJxX

The list itself is completely objective based on placings and players beaten. However, to create the X-factor a survey was conducted among a panel of community leaders, tournament organizers, and top players from around the world. The X-factor is the difference between their #PGRv4 placing and how they were rated by the panel.

La conversación entre sus pilotos deja claro que no tienen ni idea de lo que tienen delante. 
El vídeo formaría parte de un programa secreto de defensa para identificar amenazas procedentes del espacio que llevaría operando desde 2007 con un presupuesto de 22 millones de euros.

Los oficiales David Fravor y Jim Slaight estaban en una misión de entrenamiento sobre el Pacífico, a unos 160 kilómetros de la costa, cuando recibieron un mensaje por radio en su cazabombardero F/A-18F Super Hornet. Un oficial del crucero U.S.S. Princeton les preguntaba si el avión llevaba armas a bordo. «Dos CATM-9s», explicó Fravor, para referirse a un misil de «atrezzo» totalmente inofensivo. 
El USS Princeton llevaba dos semanas siguiendo un extraño contacto, compuesto por lo que parecían ser varias aeronaves que, de repente, aparecían a gran altitud, a unos 24.000 metros, y que luego se lanzaban hacia el mar, deteniéndose y cerniéndose a unos seis kilómetros de altura. Después de eso, los contactos desaparecían del radar o se escabullían. Fravor y Slaight trataron de investigar el contacto, así que viraron para encontrarse con el objeto. Cuando el control les informó que ya se encontraban en posición, descubrieron que no había nada a la vista ni al alcance de los radares de los F-18. Entonces, Fravor relata que más abajo, un objeto ovalado volaba a apenas unos metros de altura, levantando una estela. El objeto medía unos 12 metros y parecía saltar arriba y abajo de forma errática, sin volar en una dirección concreta. Tenía un aspecto blanquecino que recordaba a la espuma o al agua hirviendo, según recuerda el oficial.
Cautelosos, los tripulantes del cazabombardero iniciaron un suave descenso hacia la «perturbación». Pero, de repente, la «mancha» comenzó a ascender hacia ellos, así que Fravor decidió iniciar un descenso directo hacia el OVNI. Pero entonces, el objeto abandonó su trayectoria.

«Aceleró como nada que haya visto», dice Fravor en la entrevista. Según recuerda, se quedó «bastante sobrecogido».

Después de perder el contacto, el USS Princeton les marcó un punto de reunión, a casi 100 kilómetro de distancia. Pronto, el operador les llamó de nuevo. «Señor, no va a creerlo, pero esa cosa está en el punto de encuentro». Según dice Fravor, el objeto había tardado menos de un minuto en recorrer 100 kilómetros.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n0390DxiBJo/sddefault.jpg,0.0070739776166678404,0.0007390722883085803,9.571428571428571,0.0016893080875624693,0.007813049904976421,0.009502357992538887,2017-12-17,17:25:10,Sunday,6,4,1,4,1,33,2,1,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.410651559041946,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

And it wouldn't be a trip to Detroit without a visit to one of the most infamous pizza names to come out of the Mitten State—Little Caesars. Motown is definitely the dough town.

fromis_9, 타이틀곡 ‘유리구두’ 간절한 소망의 약속 담아!
fromis_9, 타이틀곡 ‘유리구두’로 소녀스러운 풋풋함과 사랑스러운 매력 발산한다!

사랑스럽고 풋풋한 매력을 뽐내며 대한민국 최초 걸그룹 육성 교육 프로그램 Mnet ‘아이돌학교’로 얼굴을 알린 프로미스나인이 오는 11월 30일 오후 6시 데뷔 선행 싱글 ‘유리구두’를 발표한다.

프로미스나인의 팀명은 프롬 아이돌스쿨(from idolschool)의 약자이자 최고의 걸그룹이 되겠다는 육성회원과의 약속(promise)을 지킨다는 의지를 담았다. 프로미스나인은 노지선, 송하영, 이새롬, 이채영, 이나경, 박지원, 이서연, 백지헌, 장규리 총 9명의 멤버로 구성되었으며 Mnet ‘아이돌학교’ 를 통해 육성회원의 투표로 직접 선발된 걸그룹이다. 또한 프로미스나인은 완벽한 비주얼과 함께 무한한 성장 가능성을 보여주어 연일 큰 화제를 몰아 2018년 가장 주목받는 기대주로 떠오르고 있다.

소녀스러운 상큼함에 사랑스러움으로 무장한 프로미스나인은 혹독한 트레이닝을 거쳐 그들의 열정과 노력이 빛을 발휘할 데뷔 선행 싱글곡 ‘유리구두’로 드디어 가요계에 출사표를 던졌다. 그들이 처음으로 보여줄 곡 ‘유리구두’는 동화 속 신데렐라가 남기고 떠난 유리구두를 통해 왕자님을 다시 만나듯, 소중한 마음을 남기고 갈 테니 먼 훗날 꼭 만나자는 프로미스나인의 마음을 담은 곡이다. 이는 그들의 진실된 마음과 염원을 담았기에 9명의 소녀 프로미스나인의 매력이 200% 발휘될 것이다.

프로미스나인의 데뷔 선행 싱글곡 ‘유리구두’는 아직은 화려한게 익숙하지 않은 풋풋한 소녀들이 화려한 파티에 초대받고 12시가 되어 아쉬움을 남긴 채 돌아가야 하는 상황을 뮤지컬적인 곡 구성으로 표현했다. ROCK 적인 요소가 돋보이는 ‘유리구두’는 프로미스나인의 청량함을 극대화했고 대중들의 귀를 단숨에 사로잡으며 프로미스나인만의 9인 9색 매력을 보여줄 예정이다.

데뷔 선행 싱글곡 ‘유리구두’는 단언컨대 프로미스나인의 색과 에너지를 그들만의 이야기로 담아 가요계 중심에서 빛을 낼 것이다.

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Jon DeMotto - Long time fan. What do you think of the box office success of Jumanji? Looking at about 100+ million going through it’s first week. Most box office gurus thought it would gross 100 max domestically. What led to it’s success? Will we see a sequel?

Brian Pulley - Hey John, I was wondering what your opinion is about theater's being open every day of the year and requiring employees to work major holidays.  ( Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc..) My wife just started part time at big local movie theater chain in utah but hates the fact she has to work those holidays away from family. Do you think theater's should be closed on those holidays and why do they choose to be open at all?

Martin Lawrence - I was reading a story about how AMC is looking at going to different prices for different seats. So seats in the front row would be cheaper than better seats elsewhere. Do you think this could get more people in the theaters?

PATREON Supporter Joe Zapata - Merry Christmas! Love the show and you my friend! I am friends with people in the film industry and there is a buzz going around that Carrie Fisher may be getting a push for best supporting actress in TLJ. What are your thoughts and have you heard anything?  Our princess did save the best for last!

Trevor Voletine - Hey John! Greetings from Iowa! The Greatest Showman's critic rating on rotten tomatoes is a 53%. I have read a lot of the critic reviews saying that Barnum's life was not really portrayed correctly, and it is not historically correct. Is this fair to the movie? Don't we all know movies are not history lessons? Overall I think that the movie should be based on its performance and not its historical relevance.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n3QLxKAAjB4/sddefault.jpg,0.04304420663954323,0.0018120277616328765,23.754716981132077,0.012376491503983044,0.04485623440117612,0.05723272590515915,2017-12-29,17:52:42,Friday,4,15,21,15,21,89,178,3,37,0,1,13,17,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['NEW WA', '', 'RICE GOUGE', '', 'UTES', '', '» SHOULDCRITS', 'Dao aa', '', ""'s INU a NEN"", 'ea', '', ' ', '', '=', 'o', '=', 'wn', '=', 'bed', 'a.', '=', '=', 'a', '=', '=', 'j=]', '—', 'an', '— |', '-']","['NEW', 'WA', 'RICE', 'GOUGE', 'UTES', '»', 'SHOULDCRITS', 'Dao', 'aa', ""'s"", 'INU', 'a', 'NEN', 'ea', '=', 'o', '=', 'wn', '=', 'bed', 'a.', '=', '=', 'a', '=', '=', 'j=]', '—', 'an', '—', '|', '-']",True,"['new', 'WA', 'rice', 'goug', 'ute', '»', 'shouldcrit', 'dao', 'aa', ""'s"", 'inu', 'a', 'nen', 'ea', '=', 'o', '=', 'wn', '=', 'bed', 'a', '.', '=', '=', 'a', '=', '=', 'j=', ']', '—', 'an', '—', '|', '-']",34,25,68,11,1,0,5,5.9286594462036755,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,"{'stop sign': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Support John on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Odean Osbourne - Hi John, love your show very much. Maybe one way theaters and movie studios can get more people to go to the movies, is by offering discounts on digital copies of the movies on home release. They would do this by adding a promo code on the customer half of the ticket that offers may a 15% discount. Thoughts?

Bryan Kruse - Hey John hope all is well with you. Why do we get so few swords and sandals movies these days? In the early-mid 2000s there were some great ones like Gladiator, Troy, and 300. But it seems like we haven't had a good one in at least 10 years.

Brennan Ernsonata - Hey John. Watch your show every day. Have you seen the first image of Bumblebee that they just released with B in his classic yellow bug form. Does it give you any further hope for the film?

PATREON Supporter Jermain Sneed - I often get in debates with my friends about the importance of critics and even RT.  However they always come back with mostly bad conspiracy theories.  But one thing seemed logical. These early screenings, Flying critics to set visits, junkets in vacation spots paid for by the studios.  Couldn’t all this seem like payoffs?

Marc P - Hey John. Absolutely love the content you pump out constantly. Would you consider MOS, BVS and Justice League the Superman trilogy we never got? I wouldn't put it on par with the more popular trilogies out there, but the character goes through drastic changes from the start of MOS to Justice League. And with WB being such a hot mess, I wonder if we'll ever get an official trilogy.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n3v1PU-Mmgg/sddefault.jpg,0.04153130537507383,0.0024734199645599533,16.791044776119403,0.009524512699350266,0.04400472533963379,0.05352923803898405,2017-12-30,17:28:17,Saturday,5,16,18,15,18,92,140,3,37,0,0,15,16,4,1,5.0,7.0,"['UCTS', '', 'TICS, JUNKETS', 'CARPETS AND', '', '      ', '  ', '', '3', 'i', 'y', '', '   ', '', ' ', '', 'yam', '', '+', 'Rea ie 7 i', 'N']","['UCTS', 'TICS,', 'JUNKETS', 'CARPETS', 'AND', '3', 'i', 'y', 'yam', '+', 'Rea', 'ie', '7', 'i', 'N']",True,"['uct', 'tic', ',', 'junket', 'carpet', 'and', '3', 'i', 'y', 'yam', '+', 'rea', 'ie', '7', 'i', 'N']",16,15,37,2,1,1,4,6.1862475163236175,3,"['angry', 'happy', 'happy']",1,0,0,2,0,0,0,"{'truck': 1, 'car': 1, 'person': 5}",7

HOLY HECK I have been gone for so long. As most of y'all know, I suffered a traumatic brain injury and developed post concussion syndrome. My entire life for the past four months has been pain and hospital visits. I'm still not healed and most likely will have to live with it for the rest of my life, but I can animate again! I'll try to get back to uploading frequently, I missed y'all :-)

I animate in Toon Boom and edit in Premiere Pro and use a Huion GT 221 to draw!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n5KN6lJnm7E/sddefault.jpg,0.008664508744507759,0.00040614884739880125,21.33333333333333,0.0009046042510246027,0.00907065759190656,0.009975261842931163,2018-03-07,09:35:01,Wednesday,2,8,37,8,32,45,330,0,76,0,1,8,16,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['lUSEVELT a', '', 'HOTEL Ss 35', '{ bi ry in —_', '', 'ar. aS a']","['lUSEVELT', 'a', 'HOTEL', 'Ss', '35', '{', 'bi', 'ry', 'in', '—_', 'ar.', 'aS', 'a']",True,"['lusevelt', 'a', 'hotel', 'Ss', '35', '{', 'bi', 'ry', 'in', '—_', 'ar', '.', 'aS', 'a']",14,13,33,2,0,1,4,5.994180262141204,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

The Thomas Fire chewed through nearly everything in its path on its way to becoming a 55,000-acre blaze and sending hundreds of people to shelters in Fillmore, Ojai, Oxnard, Santa Paula and Ventura.

On Tuesday, between 500 and 600 people were sheltering at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, within sight of the flames that would roll over the Ventura foothills.

At the Red Cross shelter at Nordhoff High School in Ojai, about 250 people either stayed inside the building or outside in their vehicles with their pets.

Today in this video I am sharing with you top 3 easy and 100% effective home remedy to repair and shrink your drooping earlobes easily at home. Years of wearing heavy earrings and clip ons can leave our earlobes looking saggy and scarred. It’s a natural part of ageing but while wearing the heavy earrings could have be prevented, shrinking the lobes is harder than it seems. Sure, you could resort to drastic surgery, but there a few things you can try before you make that decision.

Remedy 1: 

 1tsp Cornstarch + 1/2 tsp Honey + Aloe Vera Gel

Remedy 2:

Olive Oil Or Coconut Oil

Remedy 3:

Apple Cider Vinegar

Extinct animals may be cloned one day, or some of them at least. But one way we can see them again is to watch videos like the ones featured here. They show the last Tasmanian tiger in captivity, as hopeless zoo keepers know he is the last of his kind. They show the Baiji dolphin - a species once thought of as river goddess by local fishermen but now thought to be extinct in the wild. They show the worlds most rare creature, the last pinta island tortoise.

""Transient"" [tran-shuh nt, -zhuh nt, -zee-uh nt]
Adjective. not lasting, enduring, or permanent; lasting only a short time; existing briefly.
Philosophy. person or thing that is transient, especially a temporary guest, boarder, laborer, or the like. Electricity. a sudden pulse of voltage or current.

""Transient"" is a compilation of the best shots from my storm chasing adventures of summer 2017. Most of the lightning footage was captured in uncompressed raw at 1000 frames per second with our Phantom Flex4K. This summer I chased for over 30 days and traveled 20K miles. My respect and admiration for storm chasers became even stronger this year. This is one of the most difficult projects I have ever attempted in my career. On several occasions I found myself uncomfortable either mentally or physically. Chasing storms with a Phantom Flex4K is stressful even when things are going well. There were at least 10 days where I returned home with my tail between my legs and nothing to show after a ten hour chase and 500 miles. There were also a couple of days that I drove home with an ear to ear smile that lasted for hours. Most of the lightning was captured in my home state of Arizona. I also spent a week in the Great Plains chasing with Chad Cowan. It was during this time that I captured a time-lapse of the massive super-cell shown twice in Transient. For some reason that damn super-cell refused to spit out a proper bolt.

Lightning is like a snowflake. Every bolt is different. I learned that lightning varies greatly in speed. There are some incredible looking bolts that I captured that didn't make the cut because even at 1000fps they only lasted for one frame during playback. I also captured some lightning that appear computer generated it lasted so long on the screen.

Technical info: The Phantom Flex4K is a camera that must be post triggered while shooting high speed. This works out well for capturing lightning because the camera is always recording and rewriting to internal ram. As soon as a bolt appears in my view finder I trigger the camera to save what has been stored in the ram. Shooting at high frame rates requires a lot of light. Therefore, I mostly used my Zeiss Otus 28, 55, and 85mm lenses wide open at f1.4. In all, I captured 10TB of data during this production.

Special thanks to Chad Cowan for many of the time-lapse shots in the video and to Mike Olbinski for the storm chasing advice and guidance.

First of all, I want to apologize for my congestion and nasally voice in this video. I was battling a mean cold and didn't want to miss this weeks video. 

I read your comments on the ""How I got into Med School"" video, and you all seemed to want to hear about the residency and social media journey as well. So here we go. In this weeks video, I wanted to have an intimate conversation about my path of getting into residency, my experiences in residency, as well as how my social media route began.Being a doctor and the residency match are both complex topics. This is a much longer video than usual, and I was debating if I should split it into two parts, but the stories seemed too intertwined to separate. 

I will make shorter videos in the future about social media and residency success. I really just wanted to share with you my family medicine residency journey as I hope it may inspire you or at the very least entertain you.  If you enjoy this video, please give it a like, and if you want more intimate conversation style videos like this one, please let me know in the comments below! Stay happy and healthy!

God of War 4 for PS4 just had a new story trailer released that revealed the release date of 20 April 2018. The trailer shows a little bit of gameplay hinting at some boss encounters while telling more about Kratos & Atreus connection and history, including the mother. The game will be coming out soon for PS4 & PS4 Pro, only 3 months to wait. Here is my reaction. Enjoy!

An object was thrown through one of the bus windows -- and the damage left one fighter, UFC lightweight contender Michael Chiesa, cut up and bloodied.

Unclear who was responsible for shattering the side window but it's clear people on the bus suspect it's Conor.

Today’s theme is TRUST.

Yesterday we got our legs. Today we commit to trust. Trust me, trust yourself, trust the process. Start to breathe a little deeper and more fully. Use your breath to support you when things feel challenging.

Stick with it. Adjust, don't give up!*

Be kind. Listen.

Lyrics:
I’m a sinner
I will consider 
I am my father’s son
 
I’m a sinner 
I must consider
I've never owned a gun
 
I’m a sinner
Seasoned beginner
Lucky to be alive
 
I’m a sinner
Finished my dinner
Now I can go outside
 
If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I’d Pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand
I’ll be your handyman
 
I’m not brittle
I’m just a little
Scared of your temperament
 
I’m not brittle
I’m just a little
Scared of my government
 
I’m not brittle
Head hurts a little
Staring up overhead
 
I’m not brittle
I’m just a riddle
Born of white, blue and red
 
If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand
I’ll be your handyman

-----------------------------------------------------------
This year, from April to August, was the darkest time, but also the transformational moment of my life when this channel, ""AnDyWuMUSICLAND,"" literally came from death to life. We've learnt how to ""Fight For Love"" in 2015, how to deal with the loss when ""We Were Young"" in 2016, but every time, in next phase of our lives, there are always different, unexpected challenges for us to confront.

The most important thing is: how do we deal with the struggle? When I was trapped in the hard feelings and asking ""what have I done,"" ""why did this world do this to me?"" I almost didn't wanna fight anymore. I truly said a couple of times that ""I wouldn’t do mashups anymore."" and ""There's no way I would release Mashup 2017."" However, seeing how Ariana Grande fought against the terrorists with ""One Love Manchester"" gave me the whole new point of view. I realized that we could be sad, scared and devastated, but after all, we still need love, music, and connections with people to give us a cathartic experience. That's how we become  and stronger.

""If we never learn, we been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from the bullets?"" We cannot choose the challenges we are faced with, but if there's love, we can steer how it goes. In the end, we all have to thank, ""Perfect Struggle,"" to make us perfect, and move on to the next stage of life.

(In August, I also made a short film called ""Reconnection,"" directed & written by me, using an abstract way to express the intimate feeling of me during the dark time. And this film will be premiered on this channel soon as well. Hope you will like it!)

There are 6 stages of ""Perfect Struggle”--
I. Cultivate 0:09
II. Struggle 1:43 (""Heavy"": in memory of Chester Bennington)
III. Heal 3:15
IV. Intensify 5:51
V. Relive 7:07
VI. Perfect 8:22

Henry Bolton is officially back together with his girlfriend Jo Marney after being voted out as UKIP leader last weekend - just five months into the job. The 25-year-old model’s shockingly racist messages were sent to a friend and were leaked online. They included slurs made against Prince Harry’s fiancée in which she said Ms Markle's ""seed"" would ""taint the Royal Family"" and described black people as ""ugly"". Both Henry and Jo join This Morning to talk about the comments.
