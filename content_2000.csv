Lyrics:

Packing up your things again
And I thought we were passed this
I don’t need reminding 
Of something I can’t forget
I’m real sorry to my mother
Cause I know how much you loved her
This could’ve been so different
It’s just too hard to move on from yet

And I’d give up everything
For a moment of your time
I’d give up everything

No one ever took my eyes off you girl
And I wish that you could stay
I guess I’m always waiting for you
To come back and call my name
Like we both still felt the same
I’m miserable
And I don’t want you to know

I’ve still got your picture in my wallet
I want you to know I’ve still got it
I can’t seem to take it out
As much as I want to lose it now
I miss hearing you talk in your sleep
The sight of blood it makes you weak
And the way you look at me over your phone
And your scent all through my home

I close my eyes 
You’re all I see
You’re all I hear
You’re all I need
And you don’t leave 
Like the smoke in my lungs
I can’t sleep

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

In an effort to slow things down, our DIARIES series follows a subject through a normal day in their lives. We get to see firsthand into their routines and to share what they think and feel at an exact moment. For our inaugural episode, Palace skater Blondey McCoy spent the holidays in New York City with us.

The 21-year-old skater not only talks to us about what it’s been like to skate for Palace since the age of 14, but also recounts walking away from a freak taxi cab collision while filming Palasonic. Additionally, he talks about his interests beyond skating which include his personal brand Thames, a collaboration with Fred Perry, his jewelry project and his passion for art and music which can be seen in his “Us and Chem.” work and Burberry campaigns. Take a look above to learn more about Blondey and be on the lookout for fresh skate videos and product releases from Palace in the near future.

LYRICS

What’s left to say?
These prayers ain’t working anymore
Every word shot down in flames
What’s left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?
I’m losing my voice calling on you

‘Cause I’ve been shaking, I’ve been bending backwards ‘till I’m broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke

Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes?

Can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?
‘Cause I need you here, oh

‘Cause I’ve been shaking, I’ve been bending backwards ‘till I’m broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke

Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes
Can beauty come out of ashes

REAL FRIENDS lyrics :

[Verse 1]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the ""oh, I'm fine""s
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I felt that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess until I need to read the signs

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ohhh
Ohhh, ah

[Verse 2]
I stay up, talkin' to the moon
And feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home


[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
Lookin' for some new friends
Oh, ohhh
Ohhh, ah

[Bridge]
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ohhh
Ohhh, ah

Namajunas recounted the incident and how it affected her in the lead-up to her UFC 223 co-main event with Joanna Jedrzejczyk, which she won.

About Damon and Jo:

It’s Damon. It’s Jo. And It’s Damon and Jo. Ok so look, we got tired of all the boring, predictable lifestyle and travel content out there, so we took matters into our own hands and started filming our travels, and adventures around the globe, in 5+ languages.

Always loved that game and it's one of my favorite Nintendo games.
Now since in MHWorld the Lance running has increased in speed so drastically and loading screens between areas are gone we absolutely had to do this video. A MH race video was actually already planned long before MHWorld was even announced namely for the MH4U Everwood with its relatively large labyrinth-ish areas. Glad we didn't do it back then so it all turned out better in MHWorld eventually.

Lance is so much fun. Love the new changes as well as the old combos they brought back to MHWorld!
Hope you enjoyed this video. It was a lot of work to edit. Even for a short video like that.

Have fun with the 2nd Beta ya'll, cheers

Where: 18-mile creek Hamburg, NY
When: 1/11 12pm

So first I had to run for my life from this ice flow at Hobuck Flats. I could not believe how fast and unexpected it came downstream. So I then drove downstream to basswood to capture this flow again, but from a much safe location.
I then drove down to the last bridge before the creek meets lake Erie and waited for the ice again. I also shot a timelapse at this location.

I have been an avid hunting horn main since I first picked up the weapon back in Monster Hunter 4 and I have never looked back. 

Capcom's decision to label the hunting horn as a ""support"" weapon left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth since it might give new players a wrong idea as to how the weapon should be used. The ""support"" role in video games is often - but not always - associated with a sort of passive playstyle that revolves around only buffing your team while leaving the damage dealing to them. It might also give the impression that the hunting horn is not viable for solo play. 

This is wrong.

When you are using a hunting horn you are not a cheerleader supporting from the sides; you are in the heat of the fight attacking the monster's head to stun and break parts. Buffing your team is a major component in the hunting horn's kit, but it is not its sole purpose. It's damage output is incredibly high and it would be a waste to squander all that potential due to a ""support"" label.

The hunting horn is a marvelous and fun weapon that everyone should give a try when they get a chance.

Camila Cabello is getting ready to drop her debut album, however, there’s just a teeny tiny bit of bad news for her diehard fans. 

Some of our current Camila faves might not make it onto her album and honestly I just don’t know how to feel about that. 

Now before we all start crying in the club due to this recent discovery – because let’s be real here, Camila’s first few singles should definitely make some kind of appearance on her debut album – Camila teased us all with a couple of snippets from new, never before heard songs, on her Instagram as well as a snippet of one of her recent releases, ‘Never Be The Same.’ And for those of you wondering, yes, these two, new tracks will DEFINITELY appear on her self-titled debut album. 

One of the songs she previewed is called “All These Years” which featured her impressive vocals and what we can only assume to be lyrics that read “And it was just a quick hello and you had to go…and you probably will never know.”

While the other snippet is of a song called ‘She Loves Control’ with fewer lyrics than the previous preview. 

I don’t know about you, but those two definitely got me excited for the new album. 

Okay, now that we got the new music out of the way, let’s talk about some of her older hits not making it onto the record. In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1’s World Record podcast, Camila explained the reason for leaving quite a few of her previous released songs off of her self-titled album. 
She said QUOTE, “I feel like it’s important for me as a new artist and especially people hearing ‘Havana’ and more people kind of knowing who I am; I think that it’s really important that the message is like super consistent. So even if other songs like ‘OMG’ or ‘Questions’ or ‘Crying’ represented me in the beginning parts of the year; it felt [like] I have grown and grown more as an artist and as a person. It felt like it needed to represent the most recent snapshot of my life.”

Makes sense, right? Are you guys sad to hear that some of Camila’s previous hits aren’t going to be on the album?! Let me know your thoughts on this and how excited you are to hear her new music in the comment section below! When you’re done with that, click right over here for all the deets on how Camila passed up Selena Gomez as the most listened artist on Spotify.

There's nothing quite like the annual Academy Awards, which brings together Hollywood's most elite filmmakers and actors for a celebration of the year's most impressive films and performances.

Probably May 5th now for most of you, lol. I think there has been every obstacle you can imagine that got in the way of this video from being released. Nevertheless, the force prevailed!

Again, sorry for the wait everyone, I was getting around a nasty worldwide block on this video from our beloved friends from Disney. Thankfully, I finally got around it!

Before I get into it, let's all share this to Mark Hamill! I'd love for him to see one of my videos again, especially this one!

Anyway, this is a tribute about not only Luke Skywalker, but also a bit about our beloved Master Yoda himself. These were two Grand Masters that fostered two different eras of Jedi, but failed them in similar ways.

Now, I myself have many issues with the creative decisions Rian Johnson took with this movie. It tonally struggled throughout its narrative which allowed the movie to be unbalanced. There were also other subplots that really weighed the movie down as well. However, most of the scenes with Luke Skywalker I completely adored. The scene with Luke failing Ben took me awhile to really accept, but in the end I finally understood.

Fear has driven the Jedi for so long and most of them didn't even know it. The motives and intentions were just, but it became their own undoing. Luke and Yoda both suffered from their fear of the dark side, but that fear was what ultimately created it. Anakin was the victim of that system, and Luke understood that, which is why he thought it was best for him to die and the Jedi with it. Not just because of the Jedi order, but mostly because of his hate for himself and how miserably he failed.

This movie taught me that even the best of us can hit rock bottom, but it's what we do with that situation that truly shows our character. Luke's arc in The Last Jedi was great because he learned the importance of forgiving himself and making amends for past failures. It wasn't about throwing away the past, it was about learning from it in order to move forward.

Thank you all so much and I hope you enjoy this video!! May the Force be with you all, always.

The ARA San Juan submarine was returning on a routine mission from the Tierra del Fuego archipelago to its home base in Mar del Plata, CNN reported.

The San Juan was originally scheduled to arrive at port on Sunday. It was last spotted Wednesday in the San Jorge Gulf.

Seven failed satellite calls were detected on Saturday morning, however, the Argentine defense ministry said it could not confirm the attempts came from the ARA San Juan, the Guardian reported.

The San Juan is a 65-meter-long TR-1700 submarine, powered by four diesel and one electric engine, the Argentine military said, according to CNN.

The Argentine navy says the missing sub has enough oxygen, food and water to last for at least two weeks, the BBC reported.

Star Trek Discovery Season 1 episode 10 was probably the best episode so far, as the crew of Discovery crossed over into the evil mirror universe. While they haven't encountered their evil selves, we still got to see a lot of amazing easter eggs and references to previous Star Trek episodes like Trouble with Tribbles, and The Tholian Web. Jonathan Frakes also directed this episode and there was even a reference to a character from the original Star Trek series. So join WatchMojo as we count down our picks for the best references, secrets and things you missed in ""Despite Yourself""

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 7 and Pearl, 3 months). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

It features the spectacularly talented Ian Eastwood dancing to our song “I’m Not Through” while wearing a suit of 89 ZenFone 5’s, in front of a wall of 1139 more ZenFone 5’s. We think it’s a pretty great ad, and this no-text version of it is almost like a little mini-OK Go video. 

A million thanks to ASUS for letting us post it on our channel, and for letting Damian dream up this space-age dance party as their ad. 

Damian and Ian developed the dance and the on-screen graphics in collaboration with the wizards at IAMSTATIC and Artjail. The phone syncing was done by Control Freak. 

Enjoy!

He will be sworn in at 21:30 local time (13:30 GMT), according to the state news agency, Bernama.
The former PM came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on his one-time protégé Najib Razak.
His historic win has ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957.
Jubilant Mahathir supporters filled the streets as the victory became clear.
Mr Najib has said he will ""accept the verdict of the people"", but correspondents say a smooth transition to power is not a given after such a major political upheaval.

Lyrics

Angel eyes, yellow sky, you've got my mind in your house again.
Body right, for the flight, take me high, kiss from your mouth again.
Lay me down, feather down, you'll wear my crown make those sounds again.

You're under my ground.
Get wet in the sound.

To make you say my name again.
Make you say, make you say...
To make you say my name again.
You're no angel anyway.

You're sayin no, but I know, I'm howlin just to blow your house down again.
You say my name, spark the flame, you make me shiver and drown again.
I tie you up, strap the cuffs, hide and I'll tease you back out again.
You're under my thumb.
I call you the one.

To make you say my name again.
Make you say, make you say...
To make you say my name again.
I'm no angel anyway.

Like water,
Wet cus we're goin under.
Harder,
Sweat, when you're on me it's thunder.
(X2)

In a typical hero’s journey, the protagonist sets out on an adventure, undergoes great change and returns in triumph to their point of origin. But in the Irish genre of myth known as echtraí, the journey to the otherworld ends in a point of no return. Iseult Gillespie shares the myth of Oisín and the land of eternal youth.

Lesson by Iseult Gillespie, animation by Paper Panther.

Mercedes Sprinter Campervan Conversion.

Working backwards from a single 100W monocrystalline solar panel we work out how much power that will generate during a single day to see what devices we will be able to use in our van.
For our example this worked out to be 231Wh of power.

We go on to size the correct AGM deep cycle leisure battery to go with the 100W Solar Panel and arrive at a single 90Ah battery.

To select a suitable charge controller you simply take the rated output of the panel and divide by the nominal voltage of the battery. So 100W / 12V = 8.33 Amps. Therefore a 10A solar charge controller will do the job and will typically have a power range up to 130W for 12V system.

I have designed a solar panel mounting system that allows me to tilt the panel at different angles to match the position of the sun.

If you decide to compete in the Beast Burger Challenge, you'll face the massive burger, alongside a brick of fires and a milkshake of your choosing. We enlisted Marc Barrett, an ex-boxer who once consumed 5,000 to 6,000 calories a day, to see if he could beat the Beast.

VERSE 1:
In the crushing 
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

PRE-CHORUS:
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
When I trust You I don’t need to understand

CHORUS:
Make me Your vessel
Make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be
I came here with nothing
But all You have given me
Jesus bring new wine out of me

VERSE 2:
In the crushing
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

VERSE TAG:
You are breaking new ground

BRIDGE:
Where there is new wine
There is new power
There is new freedom
The Kingdom is here
I lay down my old flames
To carry Your new fire today

Thanks to Julio Lacerda at 252MYA.com and Carlos Eulefi for both of their wonderful reconstructions of Gigantopithecus.

Taking a look around, we can get a scoop on some interesting numbers that'll be behind the Venom F5.

Showing the car for the first time at the Geneva Motorshow, the Venom F5 will be powered by an 8.0 litre V8 with ""at least two turbos"", creating ""at least 1,600hp"" - some impressive numbers for sure. The design is clearly focused with this in mind, showing aerodynamic and cooling elements to support the direction it is headed.

A big thanks to John for his time to explore the car, and a congratulations on presenting it to the world at the Geneva Motorshow.

Thanks for watching, Tim

The Avengers PokeRap (Pokemon Rap Parody)

Written by Ryan Tellez

Idea by Logan Rees of Screen Junkies

Performed by the amazing Alex Walker Smith

Music Produced by Peter de Leon

Edited by Chance Cole

LYRICS

Ok guys, there are a bunch of Avengers in Infinity War, so here’s a little rap to help you out
You just do the singing, I’ll take care of the hard part
That’s a little conceited but OK, let’s get it on!

(Chorus 1)
Thanos is coming with his Homer beard
And to save our world, the whole gang is here

Black Panther, Black Widow, Starlord, Ironman
Winter Soldier, War Machine, Hulk, Thor, Spider-man
Okoye, Hawkeye, Falcon, Nebula
Vision, Rocket, Captain America

List ‘em, list ‘em, gotta list ‘em all! MCU!

(Chorus 2)
And speaking of beards, Steve’s is looking fine
If he and Bucky kiss, I wouldn’t be surprised

Mantis, Gomora, Doctor Strange, Loki
Scarlet Witch, Valkyrie, Groot, Drax, Shuri
Collector, Ramonda, Wong, Younger Brother Gunn
 M’Baku, Ant-Man, Agent Not Your Mother, son!

(Bridge)
The Black Order also has been confirmed
But here’s some other characters who could return!

Heimdall, Happy, Kaecilius, Scorpion
Slattery, Waspy, Karl Mordo, Birdman
Goldblum, To-May, Get Out, Zemo
Pepper Potts, Bilbo, Shocker, Cameo!

List ‘em, list ‘em, gotta list ‘em all! MCU!

(Chorus 3)
These are just the ones who are still around
Coulson’s on TV so that doesn’t count

Hawk-fam, Aaron, Friday, Karen, Howard the Duck, Hammer, Black Swan, Sharon, Ned, Flash, Gilfoyle, MJ, the new one! Luis, Dave, Nakia, Jim Morita’s Grandson

List ‘em, list ‘em, gotta list ‘em all! MCU!

Dormammu, Tinkerer, Norriss, Mean Girl
Abomination, Thunderbolt, Liv Tyler, Broke Girl, Hannibal, Dewey Cox, Fatal Attraction, Korg, Miek, Erik, Sam mother-effin Jackson

And those are all the characters who might show up in Infinity War!
Wow!  That sure is a lot of salaries to pay!  Speaking of which…
Oh uhhhh your check’s in the mail...probably… I dunno, let’s keep singing!
What?!

List em, list em, gotta list em all
Gotta list em all!
List em, list em, gotta list em all
Gotta list em all! (But seriously I’m getting paid, for this, right?)
List em, list em, gotta list em all
Gotta list em all! (I just need a verbal confirmation)
MCU!

Fear Is a Liar

When he told you you’re not good enough
When he told you you're not right
When he told you you’re not strong enough
To put up a good fight
When he told you you're not worthy
When he told you you're not loved
When he told you you're not beautiful
That you'll never be enough

Fear he is a liar
He will take your breath
Stop you in your steps
Fear he is a liar
He will rob your rest
Steal your happiness
Cast your fear in the fire
Cause fear he is a liar

When he told you were troubled
You’ll forever be alone
When he told you you should run away
You’ll never find a home
When he told you you were dirty
And you should be ashamed
When he told you you could be the one
That grace could never change

Fear he is a liar
He will take your breath
Stop you in your steps
Fear he is a liar
He will rob your rest
Steal your happiness
Cast your fear in the fire
Cause fear he is a liar

Let Your fire fall and cast out all my fears
Let Your fire fall Your love is all I feel

Fear he is a liar
He will take your breath
Stop you in your steps
Fear he is a liar
He will rob your rest
Steal your happiness
Cast your fear in the fire
Cause fear he is a liar

First we went out to the east coast of Florida to watch the sunrise on the beach, then drove to Disney to go to all 4 Walt Disney World parks riding at least one ride at each. We started off at Disney's Animal Kingdom where we rode Dinosaur, Expedition Everest, and Navi River Journey. We had some time before the other parks opened and the wait times were very low at Animal Kingdom. The second park we went to was Epcot where we had reservations for breakfast at Garden Grill. We got to meet Chip & Dale, Mickey, and Pluto while eating some delicious breakfast food. We also were able to make a fast pass for Frozen Ever After as our one ride at Epcot. After Epcot we made our way to Disney's Hollywood Studios to ride Tower of Terror. We could see the sun starting to move across the sky at this point and knew we had to start to rush a little! We finished the 4 Disney parks with Magic Kingdom and a ride on Haunted Mansion to finish the day out. Then we hit a few hiccups on the way out to the west coast of Florida to watch the sunset! Did we make it? You be the judge! Join us tomorrow for another new video!

Over the past month I’ve been experimenting and testing the Anycubic Photon DLP 3D printer and to be brief I’m very impressed, it’s not 100% perfect but for what I do, building detailed model scenery and structures this printer certainly exceeds expectations.

If you build models that need good detail like those who build model railways, wargaming and dioramas then you may want to consider one of these printers, it requires a bit of post processing however if you’re willing to spend hours building a model kit then taking the time to make and process a 3D printed item won’t seem like a big deal.

For more information be sure to visit http://www.bouldercreekrailroad.com and you will find a detailed guide on using this 3D printer as well as some common problems that you may experience and ways to fix them.

Jaden Smith was once a promising actor, but something happened on his rise to fame to cause him to disappear from the spotlight. While children of Hollywood stars often find it difficult to step out of the shadows cast by their famous folks, Jaden has been doing everything in his power to create his very own shadow since the moment he was old enough to perform. But as Jaden grew from a young boy to a young man, his relationship with Hollywood began to sour. The early box office promise he'd shown all but vanished, and the actor/rapper/philosopher has been distancing himself from Hollywood ever since...

Well, take a look inside the pitch meeting to find out! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The Last Jedi has stormed into theaters. The film is certainly one of the most complex films set in a galaxy far, far away so you’ll be forgiven if you didn’t catch everything on the first viewing. There’s a ton going on in the background that you may not have even noticed and we’re here to help you find them. For example, did you catch that Rey stole the Jedi books? Blink and you’ll miss it! Luke’s final reveal was actually telegraphed well in advanced in a masterful way. Supreme Leader Snoke actually has a piece of bling that harkens back to Rogue One! Speaking of bling, what were those dice that we saw a few times? Luke has a stash of trinkets at the tree on Ahch-To, one of them ties directly to Star Wars Battlefront 2 while another may be a reference to the beloved Knights of the Old Republic video games. We get our first look, sort of, at the first Jedi while at the temple with Luke and Rey. Did you think Rian Johnson forgot about the famous line “I have a bad feeling about this?” Think again! We got to see the old X Wing used in a very interesting way and get a call back to a character from Rogue One in the form of a ship. Of course, being Star Wars, there are a ton of cameos in the film that you likely didn’t catch either, some of them being quite obvious! So strap in for the video and enjoy the ride!

For the first time ever in 2014, the U.S. recorded more undocumented migrants from Central America than from Mexico. In particular, 52,000 unaccompanied children were detained between October 2013 and June 2014. With what seemed to be a looming humanitarian crisis to deal with, the Obama administration enlisted the help of Mexico, and President Enrique Peña Nieto's administration. 

Together, they launched the Southern Border Program initiative: the U.S. provided funding, equipment, and training to Mexico in exchange for a crackdown along Mexico's southern border. After all, many would-be migrants from Central America to the U.S. must pass through Mexico first. 

This policy worked for a few years, but levels of undocumented migrants are on the rise again. And the mounting human costs make it increasingly difficult to call a success.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xbt0ACMbiA/sddefault.jpg,0.016586275701528434,0.0007536772963449148,22.007131940906774,0.0016248407122423224,0.01733995299787335,0.018964793710115672,2017-11-21,13:00:00,Tuesday,1,8,51,8,45,47,487,0,104,1,0,2,0,3,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.667904346343898,3,"['neutral', 'neutral', 'angry']",1,0,0,0,0,0,2,{'person': 3},3

The three notice that people in the coastal regions of this country are well-fed on the bountiful supplies of fish from the ocean, while those in the interior exist on the brink of hunger. Their solution is to find a way to transport that fish inland but, predictably, they cannot agree on the best method to do this. With Clarkson in a Nissan pick-up, May in an old Mercedes 200T, and Hammond on a brand new TVS Star motorcycle, the three invent different  methods  of  food  transportation  and  set  off  an  epic,  challenging  and extraordinary journey to try and save the world.

Next week we will get the ""Kids See Ghosts"" album by Kanye and Kid Cudi. But thats's not the only reason for me to make this video. Kanye West's Ye Album was just released and it's his eighth solo studio album. This is the perfect time to look at his music history. The seven-song album was premiered on June 1st, 2018, at an exclusive listening party hosted in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the album was primarily created. This listening party was also live-streamed on WAV Media. At the listening party, comedian Chris Rock announced that the album was simply titled ye, although the title had initially been teased as LOVE EVERYONE. Unbeknownst to fans, Kim Kardashian, Kanye’s wife, had teased the title hours prior to the announcement. #hiphopuniverse #evolutionofhiphop 

Kanye Omari West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur and fashion designer. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing and co-producing hit singles for artists such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to pursue a variety of styles on subsequent albums Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and the polarizing 808s & Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, he released his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to rave reviews from critics, and followed with the collaborative album Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z. West released his abrasive sixth album Yeezus to further critical praise in 2013, and his seventh album The Life of Pablo in 2016, noted for its fragmented musical style. West's eighth studio album, Ye, was released in 2018.

West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant mainstream attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the YEEZY collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

West is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century. He has sold more than 100 million digital downloads and 21 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his generation. Three of his albums have been included and ranked on Rolling Stone's 2012 update of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.

Here, a group of men and women chat about the questions and observations they encounter about their Tourette's - and are happy to clear up any misconceptions about it that might be out there.

LYRICS:

Dark red light years
Brought near

Cold gone glowing 
Night sing 

Star death ringing 
Brought fear

I want to lie in
They call Orion 
The colors missing 
Upon the dark spring 

Cold red light years
Brought near

Dark gone glowing 
Night sing 

The worlds colliding
Unreal dividing
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring

6. Maine Coon
The Maine Coon is believed to be one of the oldest cat breeds native to the United States. Unlike some of the other cats on this list, the Main Coon can be very large. The average weight of this breed is between nine to eighteen pounds. The Main Coon is a friendly breed of cat that gets along with other cats, children, and even dogs. Even with this breed's beautiful coat, they don't need much maintenance beyond combing once a week.

Since this breed is very popular, you usually cannot find them in animal shelters. There are a few online services though that can connect you with people who have rescued Maine Coons in the wild. When you find one, expect to pay around $1000 for a purebred Main Coon.


5. Sphynx
At some point in your life you have probably seen a photo of this hairless cat. It was initially created in 1966 and has since taken the world by storm in popularity. Its signature hairless coat is due to a natural mutation of the breed’s genes. The Sphynx is an outgoing cat that loves to be played with and yearns for constant attention. A common misconception about this breed is that since it has no hair, it is an excellent choice for people with cat allergies. However, most cat allergies come from dead skin cells that all cats have, including the Sphinx.

While a breeder is one of the most common ways to find a Sphynx for purchase, some adult Sphinxes can be found from rescue groups and the occasional animal shelter. Due to this breed’s popularity, most Sphinxes cost around $1500.


4. Savannah
Between this cat’s size and spotted golden coat, the Savannah breed looks like it is straight from the wild. It was created after breeding a domestic cat with a wild African cat in 1986. The Savannah breed has become wildly popular due to its friendly nature and exotic look. This breed is great with families, wanting to be by their side and played with constantly. It is vital that this cat has plenty of sturdy toys to play with at all times. If a Savannah becomes bored or too energetic, it can become very destructive, even as an adult.

The best way to purchase your own Savannah is through a breeder. Although, they can occasionally appear at animals shelters so always check your local shelters if you are searching for your own Savannah. If you find a breeder dedicated to Savannah cats, you can expect to pay around $1500.

3. British Shorthair
As its name suggests, this breed of cat was created after Romans invaded Britain hundreds of years ago. This cat is well known for its intelligence and dignified personality. While this cat is known to have issues with new people, after a short period they usually become very affectionate. It is important to not to pick up and constantly move a British Shorthair since they do not like to be moved around by people.

Once you decided to add one of these cats to your family, expect to pay around $1000 for your very own British Shorthair.


2. Elf
Two cat owners yearned for a Sphynx with curled ears, so they created the Elf breed in 2004. This one of a kind cat is the result of breeding a Sphynx with an American Curl cat. Thanks to careful breeding over the past few years, this cat has an excellent temperament. It loves to play with its owners and usually will lay on your lap while you watch TV. An Elf cat can also quickly adapt to new animals, making them fantastic cats for any family.

While an Elf kitten can cost around $300, a hairless Elf kitten can cost upwards of $2,000.

1. Khao Manee
Of all the breeds on this list, the Khao Manee stands out thanks its beautiful eyes. This breed is well known for having two different eye colors, usually a pair of yellow and blue eyes. Thanks to its eyes and beautiful white coat, it is sometimes referred to as the White Gem. No matter who comes into your home to visit, the Khao Manee will want to greet and play with them. Due to their outgoing personality, they make great companion cats for any family.

As with most other rare breeds of cats, the Khao Manee is usually only found through a breeder. If you want to add this unique cat to your family, expect to pay around $3000to bring them into your home.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2-nlXhqnIAY/sddefault.jpg,0.009407091003286893,0.0006932785302925097,13.568992248062015,0.0023926170673350803,0.010100369533579404,0.012492986600914479,2018-01-06,00:00:01,Saturday,5,4,67,4,54,25,541,0,112,1,0,3,25,1,2,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.524939511234987,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'cat': 1},1

Lyrics: 
There goes my heart beating 
Cause you are the reason 
I'm losing my sleep 
Please come back now 

There goes my mind racing 
And you are the reason 
That I'm still breathing 
I'm hopeless now 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason 

There goes my hands shaking 
Cause you are the reason 
My heart keeps bleeding 
And I need you now 

If I could turn back the clock 
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark 
I'd spend every hour, of every day 
Keeping you safe 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason 
You are the reason 
Yeah, yeah... 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20d1g6O6Fog/sddefault.jpg,0.015697180061892,0.00017022600743891834,92.21375921375922,0.000483910296331274,0.01586740606933092,0.01635131636566219,2018-05-15,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,11,39,11,34,64,348,3,79,0,1,7,18,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.652208875628543,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

AHMIR is a Boston-based R&B vocal group. AHMIR got its beginnings over a decade ago when members Leon Jones and Michael “Big Mike” McDonald met as featured soloists in their respective college choirs. With Kelly “KC” Washington and Mark “Sing-Sing” Robertson rounding out the group, AHMIR maintains a focus on giving back and has been involved with the Pixel Project, the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society, along with other organizations.

Anthem Lights, based in Nashville, consists of Caleb Grimm, Chad Graham, Joey Stamper and Spencer Kane. With origins going back 9 years, the pop vocal group shares a common upbringing singing in church and choirs and even got their start singing faith-based, Christian music.

How To Make A Radio Hit with Portugal. The Man's 'Feel It Still' and Gotye's 'Somebody That I Used To Know'

Portugal. The Man could never have predicted “Feel It Still” to become the astronomical hit that did. Over 150 million views on YouTube. 400 million listens on Spotify. It won a Grammy, that means something right?

It was the most-Shazamed song in the country for seven weeks running. And that’s because if you’re still listening to the radio, you would have heard it across nearly every format. It was a crossover hit. A song that transcends genre, so widely accessible you can play it on nearly any contemporary radio station and it just works.

It was the group’s first chart topping single. Going on to conquer the top spot on 6 Billboard charts and almost two others.

Adult Pop Songs

Adult Alternative Songs
Dance/Mix Show Airplay

Taking Portugal. The Man from indie darlings to Top 40 giants in just weeks.

And these charts are important. Labels use these rankings to entice radio stations to play these songs even more. You see, stations need to retain listeners to keep the advertising dollars coming in and the best way keep people listening is to play the biggest hits around. It’s why you hear the same tracks on rotation all day long. The more a track plays, the higher that rank goes up and the more a single sells. And the loop continues until listener fatigue kicks in and is replaced by something new. 

Since 2003, there have only been 12 songs to top 6 or more Billboard charts, including “Feel It Still”

Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"" (2005)

Lyrics:
Praise the mountain and the rain
All the gifts that still remain
But the greatest gift of all
And the law above all laws
Is to love your friends and lovers
And lay down your life for your brothers
As you abide in peace
So will your delight increase

As the mystery of the cross
Asa Lovejoy lost the toss
And the fountain in the rain
Where my sorrow still remains
So I run to my friends and lovers
I lay down my life for my brothers
As I abide in peace
So will my delight increase",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/22QKbw_c_yM/sddefault.jpg,0.015252150310525512,0.0003325454104239505,45.864864864864856,0.0007519720542019058,0.015584695720949462,0.01633666777515137,2017-11-23,11:57:38,Thursday,3,8,6,8,6,51,72,3,16,0,0,7,0,1,0,6.0,11.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5468761528853685,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"{'teddy bear': 1, 'person': 5}",6

This is the TV series Star Wars fans have been waiting for: #ObiWanKenobi is set to return to screens in a new TV show from Disney+.

Although fans feared that rumoured plans to develop an Obi-Wan spin-off had been put on carbonite, actor Ewan McGregor – who has previously starred as the dry-humoured Jedi Master – has announced he will return to the role in a new live-action series.

“It’s been four years of saying ‘well, I don’t know’,” he told fans at Disney’s D23 Expo. “Now I can say ‘yes, we’re going to do it’.”

It’s official! Ewan McGregor to return as Obi-Wan Kenobi for Disney+ Star Wars TV series. The currently untitled show doesn’t yet have a release date. However, at Disney D23, LucasFilm’s Kathleen Kennedy announced all scripts are written and filming will begin in 2020.

LucasFilm have announced that Deborah Chow will direct the series. Chow, who recently worked on fellow Star Wars Disney+ series The Mandalorian, has also directed episodes of Mr Robot, American Gods, Jessica Jones, Fear the Walking Dead, Better Call Saul and The Man in the High Castle.

The Obi-Wan series will take place eight years after the events of 2005’s Revenge of the Sith, where we last saw Obi-Wan watching over Luke Skywalker, the secret child of Darth Vader, on Tatooine. This means the show will be set approximately around the time of Solo: A Star Wars Story, a few years before A New Hope.

McGregor has also revealed Obi-Wan hasn’t quite recovered from the Jedi Cull in Revenge of the Sith. Many are hoping the series can fill in some of the questions about Obi-Wan. Why does he call himself ‘Ben Kenobi’ in A New Hope? How is he so familiar with Mos Eisley? And did he have adventures outside Tatooine during his wilderness years?

Are you excited for #EwanMcGregor to return as legendary Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi?

 지난 13일 북한 병사의 판문점 귀순 과정이 담긴 CCTV 영상 공개가 연기되면서 그 배경에 관심이 쏠리고 있습니다.

 특히 핵심 의혹인 북한군 추격조가 군사분계선인 MDL 남쪽으로 총을 쐈는지와, 추격조 일부가 MDL을 넘었는지 여부는 영상 공개로 확실히 밝혀져야 할 부분인데요,

 영상 내용에 따라 북한군의 정전협정 위반 여부와 우리 군 대응의 적절성 등이 도마 위에 오를 것으로 전망됩니다.

 유엔군사령부가 조만간 조사결과를 발표할 예정인 가운데 CCTV 영상의 일부 내용이 알려졌습니다.

 유광석 기자가 보도합니다.

 리포트

 유엔사가 관리하는 CCTV 영상에는 북한 군인 귀순 과정이 대부분 기록된 것으로 알려졌습니다.

 영상에는 특히 북한군 추격조 4명 중 1명이 순간적으로 MDL을 넘는 장면이 포함돼 있다고  군 소식통은 말했습니다.

 MDL을 넘고나서 당황한 모습을 보이다 황급히 되돌아가는 모습이 찍혔다는 겁니다.

 추격조 일부가 엎드려쏴 자세로 귀순병을 조준 사격하는 모습, 총을 맞은 귀순병이 비틀거리며 MDL을 넘는 모습도 기록된 것으로 전해졌습니다.

 또 다른 군 소식통은 북한군이 쏜 권총과 AK 소총 총탄이 JSA 남쪽 초소 인근 나무에 박혔다고 말했습니다.

 송영무 국방장관도  지난 14일 국회에 출석해 JSA 남쪽에서 총탄 흔적이  나왔다고 확인했습니다.

녹취  정진석(자유한국당 의원/지난 14일, 국회 국방위) : "" JSA 지역에서 북한의 총탄이 우리 쪽으로 넘어온 최초의 사건입니다. 인정하십니까?  (맞습니다.)""

 북한군 추격조의 MDL 침범과 우리 쪽을 향한 사격은 명백한 정전협정 위반입니다.

녹취 문성묵(한국국가전략연구원 통일전략센터장) :  ""명백한 정전협정 위반 행위이고 따라서 강력한 항의와 재발 방지 요구가 필요하다고 생각합니다.""

 이 때문에 당시 경고사격도 하지 않았던 우리 군 대응이 적절했느냐를 두고 논란이 증폭될 거란 전망이 나옵니다.

What would have happened if Anakin got to talk to Padme in full? Would he turn back to the light? Could he team up with Obi-Wan and Yoda to fight Palpatine? 

Will Luke Skywalker and Padme be born?
Will Snoke come to fight? Where is he?
Will Anakin join Sidious in the fight, and turn on them all?

Lyrics:
Fuck 'em, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Celine, Tiffany, she flossy
Ain't concerned with who worthy, can't forget that she bossy
We house buying surf board just trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title sorry for the wait
Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Doctor Vane whoa
Barley look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bank
Fuck 'em, fuck sleep, come clean, zoning
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
I remember I was pooring, I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens, eyes looking like he rolling
Got new bags under my eyelids, new bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin', new bags on new bags
Minds better at seeing two now, needing up on my down time
Hit the waves with the new sound
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord
'Nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone
She like ""son you the boss""
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment
Can't forget that I'm golden
Don't forget that I'm chosen
Fuck 'em, fuck sleep, come clean, zoning
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
They called me a bitch
Burned me like saffron, my matter is golden
A child of the oldest
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden
He holds me when I'm present
Chosen
So hold me tight I swear
I'm golden
Fuck 'em, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' (Hold him)
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies (Golden)
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

Lyrics:
It’s tearing me apart
Deep inside my heart

Tell me why I hurt this way
Should I even love you anymore
I don’t want to find out why
I’m too scared to look behind that door

I put my trust in all my faith
And every word between us spoken
Why do I believe the things you say
When my heart’s already broken

All this pain I feel
Is tearing me apart
It’s what makes you real
Deep inside my heart

I can only count the ways
I earn these scars but they’re all tokens
Every time I see your face
I know my hopes no longer showing

I don’t need a reason to believe
If my faith’s already broken
How could I let love lead the way
When I don’t know where I’m going

All this pain I feel
Is tearing me apart
It’s what makes you real
Deep inside my heart

I thought so hard
Still I feel like I’m in chains
And I gave my heart
But the darkness still remains

All this pain I feel
Is tearing me apart
It’s what makes you real
Deep inside my heart

Tell me why I hurt this way
Should I even love you anymore
I don’t want to find out why
I’m too scared to look behind that door

Bob Ross. Just his name brings a calm. The soft-spoken painter who didn't make mistakes, only ""happy accidents,"" painted on PBS stations in the 1980s and 1990s. His untimely death in 1995 at the age of 52 occurred just when he was exploding on the pop culture scene. He even appeared in a hip MTV spot back when MTV was hip.

From the wedding ring to the wedding cake things you didn’t know about the marriage of England’s royal family


18. Their wedding date was officially considered a national holiday- Kate and Will both tied the knot at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011. Their wedding date was declared a national holiday given to British territories, Turks, and Bermuda, as well as Caicos and the Falkland Islands. The couple first met in 2001, in college, where they both attended St. Andrews in Scotland. Kate actually got really shy and started blushing and ran off when she met William for the first time. Kate is also the first Royal wife in British History to have a degree! She has a Masters degree in the History of Art. William majored in geography.
17. Spared no expense- The total cost of the wedding came out to be a shocking $34 million. Their venue was free of charge, but the two cakes cost $80,000, and the flowers cost a whopping $800,000, and we can’t forget about Kate’s dress which totaled out at $434,000. Those are insane amounts of money, but would you expect anything less from a royal family.
16. No makeup artist needed- Kate took four makeup lessons from a makeup artist in London. Her makeup teacher, Arabella Preston was supposed to come on her big day, but she didn’t have to, Kate was comfortable and confident enough to do it herself.
15. Ellie Goulding- Famous British singer Ellie Goulding performed at the royal wedding. She sang her own version of Elton John’s “Your Song” as the couples first dance. Ellie said she was so nervous about performing for the royal wedding her hands were shaking.
14. No ring exchange- You would think the fancy, royal bride and groom would have a point in their wedding when they show off and exchange their wedding rings, but that wasn’t the case. If you’re a big fan of the royal couple, you may have noticed that the Duke of Cambridge doesn't wear a wedding ring, in fact, he doesn't wear any jewelry. William made the decision to ditch the tradition and go ringless. It was his personal preference and something him and Kate discussed prior to the wedding. Maybe he got the quirk from his grandfather, Prince Philip because he never wore a ring either. So ring exchange only went one way in this wedding. Prince William isn’t one to wear jewelry, but Kate’s engagement ring, of course, is to no surprise, the same sapphire and diamond stunner that Prince William’s mother Princess Diana wore. Prince Harry had been keeping the ring safe but when he found out William wanted to propose he happily handed it over to him.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28vUbdE4Amo/sddefault.jpg,0.007778524322283717,0.0008667790572006034,8.974056603773585,0.0003189092757624862,0.00864530337948432,0.008964212655246806,2018-01-14,14:00:00,Sunday,6,8,39,8,28,48,339,2,67,0,0,6,2,2,1,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.810281944855466,2,"['scared', 'neutral']",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

This practice sets the stage for you to begin to break up stagnant energy and patterns. Be true to your breath. Experiment. Explore. I will guide you! Just get on that mat.

This video will teach you how to buy cryptocurrency for beginners on Binance step-by-step safely in 5 easy steps. Learning how to invest in cryptocurrency before putting your money into it is extremely important.

Unlike banks, credit unions, or traditional stock exchanges, there are no pre-built fail safes in this technology to protect your funds. It's up to you to take the necessary steps before buying cryptocurrency to ensure the security of your investments.

Cryptocurrency is cutting-edge technology; it’s the modern day wild wild west, so it requires some focused time and energy to wrap your head around. 

Luckily for you, I’ve done a lot of the leg work to compile this step-by-step guide to ensure you receive the knowledge and understanding you need to be successful in cryptocurrency investments.

In this step-by-step video, you will be walked through the process of setting up an account with Binance, a trusted and proven exchange for buying cryptocurrency, and you will learn how to transfer bitcoin and ether to and from the Binance exchange.

Always remember the golden rule of investing: NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose. High risk can lead high reward and we humans have a natural tendency to want to overreach.

But you need to figure out an amount you are comfortable investing and, more importantly, an amount you can truly afford to invest - then you need to stick with that amount and be patient in the process. 

Cryptocurrency is a lot more volatile and unpredictable than the stock market. Unlike the 9 to 5 New York stock exchange, cryptocurrency is traded around the world 24/7. 

So if you want to get a good night’s sleep as a crypto investor, you need to budget the amount of money you are going to invest and stick to it.

You will learn how to buy cryptocurrencies in 5 easy steps. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about how to buy cryptocurrencies on Binance.

In this video:

Prior to the 1940s, the word “nacho” had two meanings- one was a Tex-Mex slang word combining “naturally” and “of course” into “nacho.” The other was a common nickname for a small boy whose name was “Ignacio”- basically the Mexican equivalent of calling a boy named William “Billy” or Timothy “Timmy.”

FAQs

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, and that is sophdoesnails, where I do loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! I do the occasional nail video on here but they are difficult to film.
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia
-How old are you? I am 20
-What is your hair colour? 
Grey: Makki Hair colouring mask in Grey mixed with loads of conditioner.

 “l love watching the LOVE videos every year so when I was asked to participate this year I was so excited- I have always wanted to collaborate with an inspiring female director and that was Gia! She made the shoot so fun and so empowering. All of the LOVE videos embrace women’s self love and sexuality. I think Cate Blanchett one of my all time favorite icons said it best... “I mean you all know we like looking sexy, but it doesn’t mean we want to fuck you.” Thank you so much Katie and LOVE for including me this year! ♥️♥️♥️""

Gente, consideren que esta carta fue diseñada para atacar desde lejos y sacar ventaja de su extenso alcance, es de esperar que tenga malos resultados en 1 vs 1, eso no lo hace mala carta, sino que permite usarlo con diversos combos.

Reglas:
A) Los niveles de las cartas estarán  establecidos según  las reglas de torneo:
Comunes: nivel 9
Raras: nivel 7
Épicas: nivel 4
Legendarias: nivel 1

B) Luego de cada enfrentamiento, se añadirá  un icono a la carta que se enfrente a al Arquero Mágico según  el resultado de la batalla:

1) Una cruz: quiere decir que la carta fue derrotada por el Arquero Mágico.

2) Barra de salud: Cuando se use un hechizo de daño, se registrará  la barra de salud restante del Arquero Mágico.

3) Tic verde: La tropa/edifico destruyó al Arquero Mágico.

4) Cronómetro : Para aquellas tropas que se dirigen exclusivamente hacia edificios, se registrará  el tiempo que el Arquero Mágico demoró en eliminar la amenaza.

5) Espadas cruzadas: el Arquero Mágico y la carta que lo enfrentó se eliminaron mutuamente.

The bartender that can make drinks by mixing up to 6 ingredients together at the same time, so you can have anything from a rum and coke to a long island iced tea. It can be customized to make any number of drinks, can be expanded to mix more ingredients, and also has the potential for connectivity with Alexa and Google Home / Google Assistant.

The drinks can be configured on the bartender with two simple buttons and a screen, and you can add any number of drinks to the bartender's repository through the bartender's code.

Please drink responsibly.

A NOTE ON CLEANING:

After you use the bartender, you'll want to flush out the pump tubes in order to avoid bacteria growth. There is an easy way to do this in the configuration menu. Hook all the tubes up to a water source, then navigate to configure-clean on the bartender screen and press the select button. All pumps will turn on to flush the existing liquid from the tubes. I take the tubes out of the water source halfway through to pump some air through the tubes and remove all water from the pumps. Note: make sure you have a glass under the funnel to catch the flushed out liquid.

Sanitation recommendations per FDA is 1 Tbsp bleach in 1 gallon water with a contact time of 2 minutes, then rinse thoroughly for the same time (recommended weekly).

This is definitely not completely caught up- when I was trying to pull it all together, there was just WAY too much that went on, and I had to split the past month into two! I will follow up with the next one soon. I wanted to make sure this is live before I leave for my spring vacation (and have no wifi to upload).

I hope that March has been treating you well, and that you are having a lovely start to spring! Thank you by the way, to everyone who told me about your break, how school is going, and what you are studying! I know I can’t get to respond to everybody, but I try to read everything you share with me and it brings me joy that we are able to connect. That this isn’t just one sided, and that I can hear about you and your days as well. I appreciate each comment so much, just know that. And I cherish the time you spend to be here, to read this, or to leave me sweet words.

I am constantly reminded what an amazing community we have, everytime we share our thoughts here on YT or on other forms of social media. Oh and I recently activated my twitter again! So I have been attempting to figure out how to work it and interact with you on there as well!! Hehe!

Currently, I’m sitting in a starbucks in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, waiting for this upload to complete. We got off a bus from Miami (where our flight arrived), and first walked to a Mcdonalds hoping to work there LOL. But they had no outlets!! And my computer was under 10% battery, so we had to walk all the way back across to the starbucks in the other direction. And here I am! I’m wearing Tyler’s Ray Bans that are way too big and half falling off my nose because the only available seat is in the window, and my eyes hurt so much facing the sunny street. So his tinted glasses alleviate that a little. (my pink tinted sunglasses don’t do shit LOL)

Let me know how your weekend was! Happy palm sunday, everyone. So much love for you. See you soon.
Annabelle

Sometimes it feels like the last time,
that I should just get in line or fade into grey.
The holidays, they bring out the worst in me.
I see what my family sees and trust me it aint great.

Gay on Christmas,
fake smiles and forgiveness.
I've moved on from this but still it haunts me.
Gay on Christmas.
I've learned to accept less.
To bite my tongue and just receive.

The GOP, I know they don't know me.
I know it's not personal. Fear is a means of control.
But you're different. You came to my wedding.
You saw me years fighting for something, you've always had.

Gay on Christmas,
fake smiles and forgiveness.
I've moved on from this but still it haunts me.
Gay on Christmas.
I've learned to accept less.
To bite my tongue and just receive.

This year, this year was the hardest year.
Cause I stopped giving a s**t and you faded away.

Gay on Christmas,
fake smiles and forgiveness.
I've moved on from this but still it haunts me.
Gay on Christmas.
I refuse to accept less.
So clear my placemat.
I'm not coming home.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2FFY-I7r1OA/sddefault.jpg,0.01830667624336493,0.0006131422665241841,29.857142857142854,0.0018219084491004327,0.018919818509889108,0.020741726958989543,2017-12-19,16:48:54,Tuesday,1,5,50,5,44,24,439,1,91,0,3,4,0,0,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.692140741115559,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Lyrics:
Even in the darkest hour
You don't have to search so hard
You’re the one that holds the power
Now’s the time to play your part
 
If you could see your true colours
You wouldn’t have to try so hard
Hiding under all these covers
We all work the way we are

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open

Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

Baby I can read the stars
And I see how they shine for you
Don't cave yourself up in the darkness
So many better things to do

Wish you could see your true colours
Don’t be afraid to play your cards
The sky is open you should follow
We all work the way we are

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open

Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open
Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

**INGREDIENTS FOR GROUND SPICES**
- 4 pieces of bay leaves [香叶] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2El97qH]
- 3 pieces of star anise [八角] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2rAfRcL]
- 6 pieces of white cardamom [白豆蔻] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2Eh2iXs]
- 1 big stock of cinnamon, use scissors to cut it small [桂皮]
- 1 tsp of clove [丁香] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2Eks8tC]
- 2 tbsp of Gancao [甘草] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2EibPxf]
- 1/3 cup of Sichuan peppercorn [花椒] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2QQzhbA]
- 1 tbsp of fennel seed [茴香] [Amazon link: https://amzn.to/2Eun3zU]
- 1 tbsp of cumin seed [孜然] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2QNESj8]
- 1/3 cup of chili flake [辣椒粉] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2PwfpG9]

**INGREDIENTS FOR CHILI BLENDS**

- 1.5 cup of red chilies [美人椒]
- 3/4 cup of garlic
- 1/2 cup of ginger
- 1/3 cup of face heaven chilies [朝天椒]

**OTHERS**
- 1 cup of Dou ban Jiang [豆瓣酱] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2Dnoj6j]
- 1/3 cup of spicy fermented soybean paste [香辣豆豉酱] [Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/2QO5IYh]
- 1 tbsp of sugar
- 1 tbsp of salt
- 5 cup of canola oil + 1 cup of lard

**STEP BY STEP**
- Grind all the dry spices into powder (4 pieces of bay leaves, 3 pieces of star anise, 6 pieces of cardamom, 1 big stock of cinnamon, 2 tbsp of Gancao, 1/3 cup of Sichuan peppercorn)

- Put the spice powder in a bowl, then add in 1 tbsp of fennel seed, 1 tbsp of cumin seed, 1/3 cup of chili flake. Mix everything together until well combined.

- Besides the dried ingredients. You also need to grind some wet ingredients (1.5 cups of red chili Mei ren jiao, 3/4 cup of garlic, 1/2 cup of ginger, 1/3 cups of face heaven chili)

- Put the chili mixture and the ground spices in the wok. Add 1 cup of Dou ban Jiang, 1/3 cup of fermented soybean paste. Stir this on low heat until well combined. Add 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt, keep mixing everything.

- At the same time, get another pot. Heat up 5 cups of canola oil and 1 cup of lard. Traditionally this is done with pure beef tallow. But I don’t like that much animal fat so I just did a little change. You can use pure canola oil, it is fine. Bring the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

- Then pour the hot oil into the wok. You should see it is bubbling a lot. That will wake up most of the flavor. And be careful, it is safer to do it in batches.

- Let it cook on low heat for about 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and wait until it cools down to room temperature.

- This is my recommendation for making the spicy hot pot: 2 cups of base + 8 to 10 cups of chicken broth. This recipe is enough for you to make 3 hot pot.

- You can save the base in the freezer for 1.5 months.

Roman wanted to get really in the festive spirit when the 'Jumanji' stars swung by to chat to him, so he gave them some Christmas hats and dragged them outside into the freezing cold. Aren't they so lucky?

Before they froze, Roman warmed them up (and the hearts of anyone passing by) by bringing on a full five-piece choir and getting them all to sing carols; from 'The Twelve Days Of Christmas' to 'Carol of the Bells'.

And while they made about, erm, 18 pence from their renditions, the money came ROLLING IN when an actual stranger from the crowd requested Tenacious D's 'Tribute'.

If this doesn't make you feel Christmas-y as, you're a straight up Grinch. End of. 'Nuff said.

This yolk-heavy recipe is beyond creamy—without cream!—with black peppercorns. It's unlike any clumpy carbonaras you've had. The tricks? Omitting most of the egg whites; their water thins the sauce. It's a pasta worth mastering.

When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Shinola Video Quotes Used

“Perhaps most audacious, though, was using Detroit's economic peril as an opportunity to amplify Shinola's message.” - inc.com

“Shinola partnered with Ronda AG, a Swiss maker of watch movements, and Taiwan-based dial manufacturer BAT Ltd. Both foreign companies provided components and trained Shinola's workers.” - inc.com

“People were willing to pay the Detroit-made premium” - inc.com

""Shinola is, and always has been, a job-creation vehicle, and our intention is to create jobs in this city we now call home,"" Shinola President Jacques Panis - Business Insider

“Kartsotis and the other early members of Shinola had no previous ties to Detroit before starting the company there”
- Business Insider

“Shinola watches retail at $475 to $1,125, while quartz watches made by Skagen and Fossil hover close to $100. Some of the higher costs of manufacturing in the US are most likely baked into that premium, along with the high-quality materials Shinola uses, but ""compared to some of the other products out there, they're definitely charging a premium,"" Ariel Adams, founder of the blog aBlogtoWatch, -  Detroit Free Press.”

“Swiss Made” and “Made in Germany” do not require 100% of the watch to be made in country. “Made in USA” requires every component in the watch, including the movement, to be actually manufactured in the USA. - Hodinkee

“In this case, the Company sources significant inputs to many of its products overseas. For example, 100% of the cost of materials used to make certain watches is attributable to imported materials.” - Federal Trade Commission 

""certain materials presented to us during the pendency of our investigation raise concerns that Bedrock may make deceptive U.S.- origin claims in the future. Therefore, we will continue to monitor the Company's advertising closely."" - Federal Trade Commission

워너원, 하나가 되기 전 우리들의 이야기.
데뷔앨범 ’TO BE ONE’의 프리퀄 리패키지 앨범 『1-1=0 (NOTHING WITHOUT YOU)』

Beautiful 은 혼자였던 과거의 두려움과 간절한 그리움 그리고 미래에 대한 갈망을 담았으며,
워너원의 한층 성숙해진 감성을 담은 곡이다.

TO BE ONE Prequel Repackage album 『1-1=0 (NOTHING WITHOUT YOU)』

The title track 'Beautiful' talks about the fear and longing for the past and the yearning for the future.
And it shows more mature aspect of Wanna One .

Can we see the stray radiation of wireless devices? And what would the world look like if we could?

Holography of Wi-Fi radiation
Philipp Holl [1,2] and Friedemann Reinhard [2]

[1] Max Planck Institute for Physics
[2] Walter Schottky Institut and Physik-Department, Technical University of Munich

When we think of wireless signals such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, we usually think of bits and bytes, packets of data and runtimes.  

Interestingly, there is a second way to look at them. From a physicist's perspective, wireless radiation is just light, more precisely: coherent electromagnetic radiation. It is virtually the same as the beam of a laser, except that its wavelength is much longer (cm vs µm). 

We have developed a way to visualize this radiation, providing a view of the world as it would look like if our eyes could see wireless radiation. 

Our scheme is based on holography, a technique to record three-dimensional pictures by a phase-coherent recording of radiation in a two-dimensional plane. This technique is traditionally implemented using laser light. We have adapted it to work with wireless radiation, and recorded holograms of building interiors illuminated by the omnipresent stray field of wireless devices. In the resulting three-dimensional images we can see both emitters (appearing as bright spots) and absorbing objects (appearing as shadows in the beam). Our scheme does not require any knowledge of the data transmitted and works with arbitrary signals, including encrypted communication. 

This result has several implications: it could provide a way to track wireless emitters in buildings, it could provide a new way for through-wall imaging of building infrastructure like water and power lines. As these applications are available even with encrypted communication, it opens up new questions about privacy.

Place tension rods in cabinet according to the height of your balls.
Fill up with as many balls as you can! 
No-mess board games
Stretch headband over board game box.
Store vertically.
Vertical toy storage
Hang shoe organizer over the door.
Place toys inside the pockets.
DIY Lay Flat Storage Mat
Fold felt into quarters.
Tie string around a marker. Hold the end of the string at the central corner of the folded material and use the marker to trace an arch. With the felt still folded, cut along the arch with scissors to create a circle.
Use a one-hole punch to make holes around the circumference of the circle.
Thread cord through the holes. Knot the ends of the cord to secure.
File folder storage
Place small toys into file folders so they don’t get lost at the bottom of containers!
Stuffed animal zoo
(A) 1/2-in x 1½-in pine Boards x 4 
(B) 0.75-in x 3.5-in pine Boards x 8
Put together four (B) boards in a square, with two screws for each corner. Drill a pilot hole before drilling in the screw. Repeat for each corner.
Attach the (A) boards to the corners of the square base as pillars.
Put together another square using 4 more of the (B) boards, then attach to the pillars.
Paint the whole structure. Let dry.
Measure out so that there would be 5 inches between each hook. Drill pilot holes, then screw the Eye Screws into the pilot holes. Do 8 sets of 5 hooks each on each edge, for a total of 20 hooks.
Thread the nylon rope through the top and bottom hook, then tie a knot on one end. pull tight, and tie the knot on the other end. Cut, then seal the end with hot glue to keep from fraying.
Paint wooden letters and the extra (B) Board and let dry.
Place the Last (B) board face down on the top front of the “Zoo”. Make pilot holes and drill.
Make pilot holes in the wooden letters after positioning them on the front of the “Zoo”.
Drill the letters in. Hot glue ceramic animals onto the (B) board placed on top.

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Igloo Cake, I baked 8 lbs of my Ultimate Chocolate Cake, filled each layer with Italian Meringue Buttercream and decorated it all with SWEET mini marshmallows. I also ate a few. Okay... maybe more than a few!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2TGrEzBrCnY/sddefault.jpg,0.01492280229244308,0.00021922269894459928,68.07142857142857,0.00043844539788919857,0.01514202499138768,0.01558047038927688,2018-01-30,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,9,38,9,33,56,334,1,79,0,1,6,14,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.927047694440478,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ti1BBqYj4E/sddefault.jpg,0.014243321181369019,0.00013713815526324811,103.86111111111113,0.0006552156307021857,0.014380459336632269,0.015035674967334453,2018-02-28,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,7,44,7,39,48,399,2,94,0,1,6,20,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.071291423712492,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Today I want to talk about The Hound and his brother The Mountain's scene at the Dragon Pit in the Season 7 finale. It's no secret these two brothers do not like each other and when we learn why I think most of us have been waiting for The Hound to get his vengeance. When The Hound confronted The Mountain at the Dragon Pit I was very excited because I had no idea what was going to happen. I would have loved to see these two fight but I also loved the way The Hound handled this. Instead of fighting, The Hound gave his brother a very specific warning. He said, you know who's coming for you, brother. You've always known. That is a very interesting thing to say but my question is what does it mean? Who is The Hound referring to? Who is coming for The Mountain? Did The Hound see something in the fire? What do you think he meant by this? Let me know down in the comment section. Thanks for watching!

LYRICS

I wanna hate you cause I still love you 
And it's weighing on my chest
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's coming next

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
but I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good way
Yeah there's no good way

I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
You got that something that i never want to lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, ohhh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

I wanna feel you
Really feel you
Not just hold you close at night 
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's on our minds

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
but I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good, yeah there's no good way

I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
You got that something that i never want to lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, ohhh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
but I couldn't bring myself to bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home
even if I go, even if I stay

I'm chasing fire when I am running after you
You got that something that I never want to lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer
I'm chasing fire when I am running after you

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2V8-zvxKbkQ/sddefault.jpg,0.01902143483748012,0.00011370922519052781,167.28136882129274,0.0004379750764943143,0.019135144062670646,0.01957311913916496,2018-05-17,04:00:34,Thursday,3,9,17,8,16,47,111,4,23,0,3,6,11,1,4,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.502736314002331,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Reading strange-sounding Swedish words is part of the joy of shopping at IKEA. The rules for those names go back to the company's founder Ingvar Kamprad, who struggled with dyslexia and had trouble remembering the order of numbers in item codes. The name IKEA itself is acronym for Ingvar, Kamprad, Elmtaryd (his family’s farm) and Agunnaryd (the village in Småland where he grew up in).

As anyone familiar with series creator George Lucas' original Star Wars screenplay would tell you, the process of making the first film so special involved throwing a lot of bad ideas away. So while most of the series' worst moments are confined to the three prequels, the movie that started it all had plenty of cringeworthy material going into it, which many of Lucas' collaborators wisely fought to prune...

Full set of photos and description can be found here:
http://beltofvenus.net/archives/002262.html

My first twilight launch was a Minotaur launch on 22 September 2005. I got hooked on that one. The Vandenberg/White Sands launches I've viewed since then have not been with perfect sun position like this. So, 12 years later...wow!

I had two cameras running time lapse and another shooting video. The exhaust plume was a lot brighter than I expected and have a lot of clipped highlights from the f/2 lens. But still had a lot to work with. If there's another one anytime soon, at least I know the exact landmark that points to Vandenberg from Flagstaff, so I can frame more exactly.

The first stage booster shows up as a bright streak behind the second stage. In the time lapse sequences, it winds up as an orange streak dropping below the main exhaust plume.

Thanks to Brian Webb and the Launch Alert newsletter for the heads-up on this! ( http://www.spacearchive.info/newsletter.htm )

Re: Flat Earth comments. To the very small minority of people who I'd guess actually believe this: If you’re going to believe in a vast conspiracy, please consider the much more plausible conspiracy—that bored internet trolls and/or aggressive foreign state campaigns are responsible for the groundswell of Flat Earth support. As conspiracies go, THAT's the stuff that actually exists. Not a somehow rock-solid conspiracy vs. simple geometry, testable physics, and decades of observable space flight. I will not argue it beyond this statement, because the strong odds I’m debating vs. a bot/troll/social-media-information-warfare account (whatever you want to call it) makes it a fool's errand.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Xzs-R193U0/sddefault.jpg,0.00565456217532871,0.0003106902294136654,18.2,0.0008202222056520766,0.005965252404742376,0.006785474610394453,2017-12-24,10:02:36,Sunday,6,9,13,9,13,50,132,0,31,0,0,4,4,0,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.795670951469418,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

#문별#MoonByul#In_my_room#NEWRELEASE#MV#1theK#원더케이

Moon Byul already showed her unlimited potential to develop in music as she was recognized with her powerful rap skills, performances and sensitive skills to make raps as a member of MAMAMOO. In this album, she has come to the fans as an all-around musician by showing her stable singing skills. In the music video of the same title track as the album ‘SELFISH’, she plays a sloppy character with cute confidence and her lovely image as if she’s in clothes that suits her makes us make a smile like her mom.

We fell in love with Hilary Duff as an awkward preteen on Lizzie McGuire, but when the hit TV series ended, the relatable star seemed to disappear from the spotlight. Sure, there was the occasional tween movie and a guest spot on Law and Order: SVU, but that's nothing compared to her Disney days. So what has Duff been doing? We've got the dish...

We're going DEEP to try it all in this video, trying out spicy salsas in the local market and traveling to taste a lot of Mexican specialties! Just watching the cooking in the market will blow you away, there is so much to taste and try around every corner.

We visited the tlacolula Sunday street food market outside of Oaxaca to try some local, authentic Mexican foods and found a big street with tons of different vendors all lined up serving a huge variety of different foods to taste. 

Here is a list of the foods we found at the market outside of Oaxaca, Mexico:

1) MESSY Carnitas tacos - served with a selection of 3 different spicy salsas and with two corn tortillas to keep all the JUICY pork meat inside! Super delicious!
2) BIG stuffed and folded over tortilla known as the tlayuda, a true Oaxacan food specialty! It was served with Oaxacan string cheese, salsa, guacamole, and spicy chorizo sausage
3) Delicious Mexican BBQ - Here we found the meat lane, serving up a ton of different different cuts of meat, from thinly sliced beef and pork to the amazing and spicy chorizo sausage, it was all super delicious!

4) Cow foot soup also known as caldo de pata, made with a rich tomato broth full of spices and served with nice jelly like cow feet, this was definitely a must try dish in Oaxaca!

5) Super plump pork sandwich bun. This was made from pork head meat and was super delicious when drizzled in the slightly spicy salsa verde! Very tasty and worth trying!

These are just some of the foods you can try in Oaxaca, Mexico. You could travel here and spend years trying new foods, it really is that delicious!

I need your help! I’m working on a new brand and I’m doing some research on cosmetic bags. Can you let me know what kind of bag you’re using now to store your makeup and brushes? Do you prefer hard case or soft case? What colours do you like? Vegan leather or real leather? What size do you prefer?

This will be a huge help for me as I’m working on cosmetic bag designs. The red one in the video is one of them. I’ve also made an Instagram account where you can see other designs I’m working on http://instagram.com/markandscribe

Have you ever tried calling your Crush and tried telling that favourite person of yours that you have a crush on him or her. So today i went out asking boys and girls to call their crushes in front of the camera. The fear of rejection and  happinesss persists while calling their crushes. Without thinking of that people called them and shared what they had in their hearts

But despite their differences, they're each other's biggest fans. Here's the truth about their unique relationship...

LYRICS

Oh, come and see the opening band
Now that you've got your tickets and beverages in hand
They look so tired
Sound uninspired
guitars are secondhand 
'Cause no one likes an opening band

Nobody likes the opening band
Their set time's far too early and I've never heard of them
And chances are
They wont go far
Career is sure to end
'Cause no one likes an opening band

Oh unfamiliar things will make us nervous
But singing here for you gives me a purpose, so...

Take pity on the opening bands
'Cause no one came to see them
Except their mom and dad
But if you lend an ear and give them just one little chance..

You may just like the opening band.

_________________________________________________________________

My name is Matt Estlea, I'm a 22 year old Woodworker from Basingstoke in England and my aim is to make your woodworking less s***.  
I come from 5 years tuition at Rycotewood Furniture Centre and 4 years experience working at Axminster Tools and Machinery where I still currently work on weekends. During the week, I film woodworking projects, tutorials, reviews and a viewer favourite 'Tool Duel' where I compare two cometitive manufacturers tools against one another to find out which is best. 
I like to have a laugh and my videos are quite fast paced BUT you will learn a lot, I assure you.

Lets go make a mess.

My beautiful wife and my cute dog, a golden retriever named Cali, join me on an ice fishing trip from the off-grid log cabin in central Ontario Canada. We start off the day with coffee – actually lattes made on the wood stove - before setting out with the sled and ice fishing gear to catch and cook rainbow trout for dinner. Our DJI Mavic Pro drone captures video and photos of the surrounding wilderness, and I film the trip with my Canon 80D and Canon 6D. Cabelas Canada was kind enough to provide us with a 6-man ice fishing hut, Jet Sled and ice chisel to make our fishing trip more comfortable. 
We set out across the frozen lake with the dog running ahead of us, she climbs the granite cliffs to investigate the wildlife in the forest of the Canadian Shield. Once we find a nice spot to set up camp, we try out the G Stove for the first time. In the attached oven, we bake chocolate chip cookies and on the stovetop, I heat up a pot of green curry soup.
I auger (drill) several holes in the ice while my wife captures the scene using the drone. Once the fishing lines are set, we settle in and enjoy the amazing scenery of wilderness Canada on a remote lake in the backcountry. I have camped on this lake many times in the past and I know the fishing is quite good. Within no time, I catch 5 rainbow trout and I keep 3 of them the to cook for dinner later that night.
The weather is perfect; with relatively warm temperatures, partial cloud and intermittent snow flurries. In the late afternoon, we pack up the tent, camping gear, wood stove, axe and other bushcraft tools and head back to the log cabin for dinner. Before we leave, the clouds break up on the horizon and we are treated to a spectacular sunset over the lake, with granite islands and windswept pines in the background.  

Back at the off grid cabin in the wilderness homestead, I light a fire in the stove and prepare the trout for dinner. Catch and cook fresh fish is one of our favorite meals, and this is no exception. We accompany the fish dinner with chili and red wine. Living off the land using primitive technology is my preferred method of procuring dinner, but this is a close second. My survival in the coming years as I prepare to move more off grid will depend on my bushcraft and survival skills.

Catching the trout was a little trickier than I anticipated. I had artificial lures as well as minnows and worms, and to my surprise, on the worms actually worked. All five trout were caught on worms actually, which I never would have predicted. In the days following this trip, Joe Robinet and I headed out to catch and cook warm water species of fish including pike, perch and walleye (pickerel). These fish much preferred minnows and were easier to catch. Plus, since we winter camped nearby in a hot tent, we were able to fish right until dark when the fish were more active.

Lyrics to Chemicals

I fell in love with the chemicals,
I used to pray for a miracle, 
But I know that it's all over

We used to sit by the waterside,
I'd kiss your cheek and say you're mine,
But now I know its over

And all these little things,
Start to slip away
And all these little things,
Start to fade away

And you said
""Hold me, I'm falling apart""
""I’m scared and lost in the dark""
But this feeling, surely cannot last,
So I took it away...
I took it away...
Away from you

I held your hand, but you let it go
I knew your heart had found a home,
and now I know its over

I flew it out into the sky,
Trying to run from this mountain I couldn't climb
Because I knew I'd fall over

And all these little things,
Start to slip away
And all these little things,
Start to fade away

And you said
""Hold me, I'm falling apart""
""I’m scared and lost in the dark""
But this feeling, surely cannot last,
So I took it away...
I took it away...
Away from you

And we were,
Making plans and breaking dreams
And you were next to me
It's 3am in the back of a cab and I am begging on my knees,
Don’t go, wont you stay?
I can’t stand to watch you walk, away, from me.

And you said
""Hold me, I'm falling apart""
""I’m scared and lost in the dark""
But this feeling, surely cannot last,
So I took it away...
I took it away...
Away from you

My little brother is back! I saw Jarrod AKA my brother at the skatepark today and we had an absolute ball. Jarrod and I rode our scooters in the skate park and he showed me a bunch of his new scooter tricks that he learned while I was away. He is still working on his scooter flip tricks, but he is getting very close to sticking it! When Jarrod got the envy scooters sunglasses and put them on, he looked exactly like my little bro would in those glasses. Plus, this kid is HILARIOUS! Definitely belongs on a TV talk show. Thank you all for watching and enjoy!

1) Disney Reportedly Closing in on Deal to Buy Parts of Fox

2) Rian Johnson says he’s not interested in making Knights of the Old Republic

3) ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’ Plot Details Emerge

4) ‘Baby Driver’ Sequel “Being Hammered Out,” Edgar Wright Plans to Write the Screenplay

5) Lionsgate drops John Travolta’s ‘Gotti’ ten days before release

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

In a new report from CNBC, talks between Fox and Disney are back on and have moved far enough along that it looks as though a deal is in sight and could be announced as early as next week. As previously reported, the assets for which 21st Century Fox are looking to sell off include the film studio properties like X-Men, Deadpool and Fantastic Four, along with their tv properties and non-broadcast TV parts including FX and National Geographic – reportedly worth $60 billion dollars.

During the press event for Star Wars The Last Jedi, Mashable was able to speak with director Rian Johnson about his plans for his new trilogy of films set outside the Skywalker Saga. The outlet specifically asked about a certain property fans are hoping to see onscreen – that of an adaptation of the popular video game Knights of the Old Republic.

BUY OR SELL

Ahead of the first trailer that will be dropping Thursday night, EW has revealed new plot details for the Jurassic World sequel: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The follow up sees the return of Chris Pratt’s Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard’s Claire Dearing, in a story that will be set several years after the events of Jurassic World.

In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, director Edgar Wright confirmed that Sony is looking to do a Baby Driver sequel; with talks already in the works to make something happen. While Wright has a number of projects in the works, he doesn’t yet know which project of his he’ll tackle first.

Just ten days before John Travolta’s John Gotti biopic was set to open, Lionsgate has abruptly cut ties with the movie and sold the finished film back to producers. According to the Tracking Board, the producers for Gotti are expected to seek a new distribution deal for the movie, with the planned release date of December 15th now looking to be impossible to hit.

Pacific Rim Uprising – In Theaters, RealD 3D and IMAX March 23 
http://www.pacificrimmovie.com 
The globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising. John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave his life to secure humanity’s victory against the monstrous “Kaiju.” Jake has since abandoned his training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. Jake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. Pacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. #JoinTheUprising #PacificRimUprising

Species Profile : Metriacanthosaurus | Jurassic World Evolution

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

By the end of this video you should have enough knowledge so you don't end up buying a fake Samsung Galaxy S9+ believing that you are buying an original one. 

Get the original Samsung Galaxy S9+ on Amazon: http://geni.us/dg07kc

A fake Samsung phone doesn't offer any performance, no quality control, no warranty. An original Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus is better in every way. Clones are not recommended! 

Feel free to ask any questions that could help you make sure that you are purchasing an original Samsung S9 and not a replica.
Buying your Samsung phone from an authorized Samsung retailer is always a good idea!

The secret to this type of exponential success? Bin your ‘affirmations’ and ‘goals’ and instead embrace fear as your friend by making irreversible decisions. Instead of hapless resolutions members of the ""Lock-In"" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The “Lock-In"" system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives. Many of the most successful people in history have used its phenomenal power to create extraordinary success. Think you're hardcore enough? Then enter the Cult of Extreme Productivity Mark Adams is Vice President and Head of Innovation at VICE, which has come from humble beginnings as a print magazine to digitally transform into a 5 billion dollar youth media empire. In this talk, Mark describes the cult of extreme productivity that he became part of alongside his brother. The cult is all about making irreversible decisions that make “manifesting” your dreams the only option because not achieving it would create indescribable suffering. This is the second time Mark has done a TEDx talk. The first time his talk was banned. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Like I tried to say several times in the video, these events aren't like every day things, and most people are fine.  But its the weirdos that kinda stand out in your mind, you know?

This is the story of the Atari Nintendo Entertainment System that almost was.

Have a small correction on the video.  I accidentally used the NES NY trial run for the full launch date and the 7800 full retail launch date. I meant to use the full launch date for both. The NES full launch only beat the 7800 to market by a few months, which if anything it makes the sales number comparison more jarring in favor of Nintendo.

Bikes. They come in all shapes and sizes. Choppers, bobbers, cafe racers, you name it. Even more interesting are the men and women who build their lives around building, tweaking and riding them. 101 Magnificent Motorcycle Men celebrates the biker - that lone soul who'd rather be in the middle of nowhere on two wheels, than anywhere else.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2rhLLPupcUU/sddefault.jpg,0.012585272245434764,0.00012515012525990608,100.56140350877192,0.0007135752756047278,0.012710422370694672,0.0134239976462994,2017-11-15,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,9,38,8,33,54,334,1,79,0,1,7,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,"['ry', '', 'a', 'Sv) :', 'earn', 'eT', 'RDEN |', '. / \\']","['ry', 'a', 'Sv)', ':', 'earn', 'eT', 'RDEN', '|', '.', '/', '\\']",True,"['ry', 'a', 'Sv', ')', ':', 'earn', 'eT', 'rden', '|', '.', '/', '\\']",12,12,21,6,0,1,1,6.027783222974197,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

What happened with Cambridge Analytica highlights this perfectly.

Before many people join a network, it may not be so useful. But the more people join, the more useful it becomes. That’s the network effect. Facebook is a step beyond that — it’s the network effect on steroids.

This is what makes facebook so great — it knows everything about you! — and what makes facebook so awful — IT KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. And while its network of 2.13 billion monthly users doesn’t pay any money to use the core service, Facebook makes plenty of money — millions daily — *buy providing advertisers access to that user data*. And everyone on the site agreed to this when they signed up.

Welcome to episode 5 of a new Minecraft multiplayer modded server series with my Minecraft YouTuber friends. You might recognize a few familiar faces from Crazy Craft 3.0, Trollcraft and One Life! We're using a new custom modpack I put together called Fun Craft, it contains many exciting existing mods aswell as a few fun custom mods made by me (with the help of Paul101). This modpack contains new dungeons, monsters, pets, bosses, weapons and tools to play with!

In this episode, I build an animal village for my animal girl daughters! I also take on a quest to tame a Fennec Fox girl from a far away desert.

We're still adding some new players but here's the roster so far:

“Astronomers may have spotted the first comet or asteroid to visit from beyond the solar system. They’re now scurrying to aim telescopes at the object, provisionally called A/2017 U1, to learn more about its mysterious origins.”

https://www.seeker.com/space/astronomy/massive-asteroid-florence-flies-past-earth-at-record-breaking-nearness 
“A mountain-size space rock cruised past Earth this morning (Sept. 1) in a record-breaking encounter that has long had scientists drooling. At 8:06 a.m. EDT (1206 GMT) today, the roughly 2.7-mile-wide (4.4 kilometers) asteroid 3122 Florence came within a mere 4.4 million miles (7 million km) of Earth — just 18 times the distance from our planet to the moon.”

In an Instagram video, Timberlake shows himself getting a haircut while listening to one of his new songs. “I’m really feeling myself right now on my birthday.” Timberlake says.
He says he ""feels like DJ Khaled"" while sitting in the chair promoting his music, and clears up misconceptions around the name of his album. “The album is named after the my son,"" Timberlake says of his boy Silas. ""His name means ‘of the woods.' Stop telling me I’m making a country album!” Timberlake laughs while he gets his hair buzzed.

His album -- which is not a country album -- drops Friday.

Trump took a brief break Wednesday to reach for the water during a blow-by-blow account of his foreign travel as president.

Trump first reached into the lectern to seek water but couldn't find any. He then required a helping hand from others in the room to spot the bottle of water on a nearby table. He took another drink a few minutes later.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump frequently mocked then-rival Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's frequent water breaks.

Trump said of Rubio during a 2015 appearance in South Carolina: ""Rubio, I've never seen a young guy sweat that much.""

Trump added: ""He's drinking water, water, water, I never saw anything like this with him with the water.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2tri_EkupBw/sddefault.jpg,0.001807318157128043,0.0003061577206063898,5.903225806451613,0.0009085971063157377,0.002113475877734433,0.00302207298405017,2017-11-15,21:16:48,Wednesday,2,10,14,10,13,52,117,1,28,0,0,2,0,2,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6964743417166215,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2
