Every time you send something on the internet, it’s a copy. But using new technology, can we make digital goods that are... rare? 

That’s the question behind CryptoKitties, a new game to buy, breed, and sell digital cats on the blockchain. These cats are more similar to real-world collectibles like beanie babies or baseball cards than they are to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 

In just the last few months, a whole community of third party sites and services has formed around CryptoKitties. And fans have spent more than $23 million playing along. 

All of this is made possible by the clever and surprising code behind the game. 

Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines. Check out http://www.vox.com.

I have a Go Fund Me setup if you would like to support me get research done into this type of cancer (Pleomorphic Sarcomatoid Carcinoma and Primary Cutaneous CarcinoSarcoma) with the hope that we can eventually find the best treatment, as there are very limited / no options left now, I have already started passing on samples, medical files and reports to specialists worldwide. The next step is to get my DNA Sequenced, so as specialist medical researchers can see if we can find the needle in the haystack to treat this.

Not everyone can get the same type of treatment, not everyone is able to have chemo, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and the likes. I am one of those with a rare form of cancer that can't be treated by conventional means.

There is litterally no research into this type so it's important to me, to document everything and record it all, so that if something can be done and someone spots it, we have that added bonus!

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make my Giant Oreo Cake, I baked 8lbs of Ultimate Chocolate Cake, filled it with Italian Meringue Buttercream and stuffed a layer of Oreos in between each cake! Once I crammed as MANY Oreos into this cake as I possibly could, I covered the entire cake in black & white fondant and decorated the top of the ""cookie"" with that classic Oreo detailing!

Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

Update Jan 2020 - Comments have been disabled because I have listed this video as made for children under YouTube's new guidelines. 99% of the thousands of comments were positive so there was no problem there. It's just that, because the subject is 'Frozen' - it would definitely attract children so it has been marked that way. And videos marked as such do not have commenting capabilities.

I am a composer from Norway and I started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place that you can visit in order to slow down and relax. I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. Have a wonderful day or evening!

Since then, it’s been a whirlwind five weeks in which the 25-year-old Brazilian has been slowly adapting to his new team and city.

Among the biggest highlights was his Barça debut, which came at Camp Nou on January 25th in Barça’s 2–0 win over Espanyol in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals second leg. And more recently, on February 8th, Coutinho scored his first Barça goal, which came in the second leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals against Valencia.

BBC correspondents say protesters are hugging soldiers in the crowd and cheering for them.
One man told the BBC the day was ""about a new beginning"".
The rally is supported by the army and members of the ruling Zanu-PF party.
War veterans - who until last year were loyal to the president - are also saying Mr Mugabe should quit.

DISCLAIMERS

- I'm not an authority on body image and I'm not trying to give absolute rules for what's ok and what's not ok when talking about your body. I'm sure for some people hearing people talk about specific body image issues surrounding specific body parts is helpful and healing and reassuring, but it has only ever been damaging to me personally and I mentioned it in the video because I was going to ask that we all try and avoid critiquing specific body parts in the comments (I just forgot to say that part lol whoops)

- when I say that people have no reason to be assessing my body because nobody sees it, that's absolutely not me saying that if you DO live a life where people see your body (if you're in a relationship or you're an athlete or if you do anything physical like that) that it's ok for people to judge you either. 

- don't be taking / sending nudes if ur under 18 lol that's ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! x

sorry this one's a bit long and a bit ramble-y!

Erik Voss analyzes the film's deeper meaning and the subtle design choices made by director Ryan Coogler and his creative team. What callbacks does Black Panther make to Captain America and Thor, and how does it connect to Avengers Infinity War? How is Killmonger/N'Jadaka (Michael B. Jordan) influenced by figures like Malcom X, but also Heath Ledger's The Joker in The Dark Knight? What is the hidden meaning of the movie's prologue and its final scene?

Just kilometres up the hill, lava has been gushing from the ground and destroying dozens of homes as new eruptions and earthquakes rattle the region.

The property is within the mandatory evacuation zone, but Mr Montoya is staying behind unless he is forced to leave.

""If it happens, if it blows its top and I'm there at the time, I'm 76-years-old, I've lived a good life,"" he said.

Letra:

[Willy Rodriguez. Cultura Profética ]

Ya no puedo ni comer
Es que no te puedo olvidar
Ay vida mía ayúdame
Sin ti no puedo vivir mas
Y sigo así, sin tu amor
Y sigo así
Es que mi vida sin ti
No puedo vivir, no!

[La Vida Bohème ]
So tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
I've to get on my knees and pray
So tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
Oh! baby it's not enough, enough ( baby it's not enough)
I've to get on my knees and pray
Enough, enough, enough, enough

[Beto Monte. Rawayana ]
Todo quedo en el ayer
Lagrimas en nuestro altar
Tu eres mi alma gemela
Sin ti no puedo respirar
Y sigo así, sin tu olor
Y sigo así
Es que mi vida sin ti
No puedo vivir, no!

[La Vida Bohème, Beto Monte ]
So tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
I've to get on my knees and pray
So tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
Oh! baby it's not enough, enough ( uh, baby it's not enough)
I've to get on my knees and pray
Enough, enough, enough, enough

[Rap: Ramses Meneses. mcklopedia ]
Si, ya no puedo dormir
Ya no puedo respirar
Si no dejo pensar, en que los días sin ti, sin tu perfume sobre mi Son como una tortura como una tortura sin fin
Si, para que quiero existir
Si, por que me dejas así, sin ti
Si tu eres la luz de mis ojos, razón de mi ser, naciste para mi
Yo no pensaba que fuera así
Pero descubrí, cuando yo te conocí
Que mi corazón comenzaba a latir
A ti no te podría mentir, jamas podría fingir
Tu eres todo lo bueno que hay en mi
En que es muy triste mi vida sin ti (sin ti, sin ti)

[La Vida Bohème, Beto Monte, Willy Rodriguez ]
Y sigo así, sin tu amor
Y sigo así
Es que mi vida sin ti
No puedo vivir, no!
So tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
Come rock steady debe doo va day, (so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough)
(Come rock steady debe doo va day) enough, enough, enough, enough
Baby it's not enough, i've to get on my knees and pray
Enough, enough, enough, enough

[ Beto Monte, Willy Rodriguez ]
Ya me tengo que ir
Y no me quiero alejar, no!
Ay vida mía ayúdame
Sin ti no quiero vivir mas
Y sigo así
Sin tu olor
Y sigo así
No lo puedo evitar
Ayúdame
No te puedo olvidar
Es que sin ti
Es que sin ti
Es que sin ti
No puedo vivir... mas",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jRuXTUwOfoQ/sddefault.jpg,0.004654966982346695,0.00016877995646940826,27.58009351181708,9.893512852161817e-05,0.004823746938816103,0.004922682067337722,2018-01-19,04:48:22,Friday,4,13,69,13,50,83,521,6,85,0,0,10,29,0,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6728013175697445,2,"['neutral', 'sad']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,{'person': 3},3

For this first flight test, Falcon Heavy’s two side cores launched the Thaicom 8 satellite (May 2016) and the CRS-9 mission (July 2016). Following booster separation, Falcon Heavy’s two side cores landed at SpaceX’s Landing Zones 1 and 2 (LZ-1 and LZ-2) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Falcon Heavy’s center core attempted to land on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.

Selena Gomez makes her epic return to the stage with a heart stopping performance of Wolves at the 2017 American Music Awards

Talk about a comeback, because Selena just proved nothing can slow her down.

All eyes were on Selena Gomez tonight at the American Music Awards. As if she didn’t already wow on the red carpet, debuting a brand new blonde ‘do, Selena really had everybody’s attention with her highly anticipated performance of her latest single, Wolves, featuring Marshmello.

Dressed in a silky cream slip, Selena began the song crawling across the stage amidst the scene of a car accident. Her look, complete with fake blood on her legs and face, really set the tone for a seriously intense, gripping performance.

This also marks Selena’s first LIVE performance in over a year, and also since she revealed to the world that she secretly received a kidney transplant from her best friend, Francia Raisa, this past summer. Selena took to her Instagram this week to tease her performance with a video of her singing a snippet of Wolves, along with a caption that read QUOTE

“My first performance in over a year.. the AMAs have been a place where I’ve shared some of my most intimate moments. Heart wants what it wants, after treatment and now Wolves. This Sunday.”

It’s safe to say Selena is back and ready to dominate, yet still as humble as ever, proven by a sweet shrug as she thanked the audience as her performance came to an end.

And unsurprisingly, the internet had a whole lot to say about Sel’s comeback, with most so happy to see our girl back and slaying the stage once again. Still, her performance is also receiving backlash, with some accusing the singer of lip-syncing to a pre-recorded track, rather than singing her song LIVE.

Whether or not she was lip-syncing will remain a mystery, but what’s evident is how beautifully artistic her performance was, beginning to end.

Now it’s time for you all to weigh in with your thoughts on Sel’s performance so drop it down in the comments. Then you can click right here to check out Selena’s brand new look, and of course, make sure you hit that subscribe button. Thanks so much for tuning in, I’m Sinead de Vries, and I’ll see you all back here soon on Clevver News.

This is a discussion of the entire movie, complete with major plot threads, character developments and all the spoilers. I am a long time fan of the Star Wars franchise, and this latest instalment, despite getting positive reviews in the media, may be the most polarising yet.

❤️10 Funny Pranks! Prank Wars! https://youtu.be/2b-AX80yxdI

We are all amazed at the lives of the rich. That’s why reality television shows centering around affluent people do so well. People want to know what it’s like to never worry about the costs of anything. They want to see inside the newest cars and the biggest homes. So, we’ve decided to take you into the lives of the Rich Kids of South Korea so you can see just what it’s like.

First of all, the most well-off kids in South Korea, live in the Gangnam area. We know you probably thought Gangnam was just from the song Gangnam Style, but no it’s a real area and it’s like the Silicon Valley and Beverly Hills of South Korea all at once. When a person says they live in the area, you know they are in the top 1% of South Korean wealth.

The rich kids don’t shy away from plastic surgery. In South Korea, it is common to get procedures done that make your eyes bigger and your nose look longer. These surgeries are an attempt to look more western and to show off to those around you that money can truly buy anything, including your looks.

Being born into a family with money also means that you probably won’t go to school in South Korea. No, the richest families send their kids off to schools in English speaking countries. This gives the children a leg up on learning the language to almost a native proficiency.

From the lavish houses to the dietary preferences, everything is different for the well-off kids in South Korea. Watch until the end of Inside The Lives of The Rich Kids of South Korea to find out which beverage equals affluence in the country.

After my DO NOT REKT My iPHONE X in REAL LIFE Challenge with REKT tons of you commented to do Fortnite gadgets in real life. I saw a Guava Juice YouTube video where he lived as a Fortnite character for 24 hours, then I saw Battle Universe do a couple NERF Fortnite Battle Royale Challenge videos, Team Edge did a Fortnite Battle IRL, Jacksepticeye did chaos mode 5, and even DanTDM has been playing the video game a lot. Instead of using cardboard boxes for the game this time, I use loot llamas (pinatas), fill them with candy and a secret fortnite gadget, we put our phone in an empty treasure llama, randomly shuffle, and then use real life Fortnite ninja gadgets to open the llama. We use melee items The Initiator, hockey stick, and doomhammer to unbox the mystery box treasure llamas. Then we DIY and build our own items from scratch. We make the ruler sword, the stop axe, and the antler axe. We really put those fornite gadgets to the test against the fruit ninja. There are so many fortnite funny moments. It's a bit like the what's in the box challenge but 2018 Fortnite ninja style.

Thanks to Epic Games for sponsoring this video. You can play the game on Xbox, PS4, PC, Mac, and now there is even fortnite mobile.

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.

Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her Dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who - against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit - must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, “Tomb Raider” is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero. The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (“Ex Machina,” “The Danish Girl”) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”), with Oscar-winner Graham King (“The Departed”) producing under his GK Films banner. The film’s production began on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

“Tomb Raider” also stars Dominic West (“Money Monster,” “300”), Walton Goggins (“The Hateful Eight,” “Django Unchained”) and Daniel Wu (AMC’s “Into the Badlands”).

Shooting on location in South Africa and the UK, Uthaug directs from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet. The director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (“Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”); production designer Gary Freeman (“Maleficent”); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (“Skyfall,” “Gorillas in the Mist”); and costume designer Tim Wonsik (key costumer, “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”).
“Tomb Raider” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM.

오늘은 체코 국가대표 알파인 스키 선수들과 함께 설 선물용 명품 과일을 먹어봅니다!! 이 라이브 방송 할 때가 마침 설날이어서 마트에서 제일 비싼 설 선물 과일 세트를 사다가 대접해봤어요! 한국분들에게는 그냥 평범하다고 느껴질 수 있는 사과, 배, 그리고 레드향을 체코 선수들은 처음 먹어보는 거라고 하더라고요!! 특히나 한국 배는 체코나 영국 배랑은 정말 다르거든요! 근데 사실 저는 어느새 한국 과일들이 익숙해졌는데 체코분들이 신기해하시니까 그게 더 신기하더라고요! 아무튼 이번 영상도 재밌게 봐주셨으면 좋겠어요!!

Today we try Korean “premium” fruits with Olympic alpine skiers from Czech Republic! It was Korean (Lunar) New Year when we had this live show, and we thought it would be nice to treat them to traditional new year gifts in Korea: premium fruits! We try the most expensive apples, pears and Redhyang oranges we could find! They may sound common and even boring, but they may be very different from what you are thinking of if you are not from Korea...! Hope you guys enjoy watching this episode! :)

Joe Rogan Podcast with Colion Noir Discusses Guns,  NRA, Gun Control, Media, Censorship, Mass Shootings, Hollywood

You all asked for it, and now you’re getting it. I finally made it onto Joe Rogan's podcast, “The Rogan Experience.”  I would love to say that by watching this video you’ll find the meaning of life, but that didn’t happen. However, what you will see is an open and honest conversation about guns, the media, drugs, mental health, and just life in general. I haven’t enjoyed a discussion more than the one I had with Joe Rogan. The time just flew by and before I knew it two hours passed. I honestly could have continued the conversation into the night. Either way, I hope you all enjoy watching this conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.

1. V pays attention to Jimin only after knowing that he’s been recorded.
2. Jungkook was hitting his hyung, Jimin
3. Taehyung bothering the sleeping beauty, Jimin

Cone Snails have an arsenal of tools and weapons under their pretty shells. These reef-dwelling hunters nab their prey in microseconds, then slowly eat them alive.

DEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.

New research shows that cone snails — ocean-dwelling mollusks known for their brightly colored shells — attack their prey faster than almost any member of the animal kingdom. 

There are hundreds of species of these normally slow-moving hunters found in oceans across the world. They take down fish, worms and other snails using a hollow, harpoon-like tooth that acts like a spear and a hypodermic needle. When they impale their prey, cone snails inject a chemical cocktail that subdues their meal and gives them time to dine at their leisure.

Cone snails launch their harpoons so quickly that scientists were previously unable to capture the movement on camera, making it impossible to calculate just how speedy these snails are. Now, using super-high-speed video, researchers have filmed the full flight of the harpoon for the first time.

From start to finish, the harpoon’s flight takes less than 200 micro-seconds. That’s one five-thousandth of a second. It launches with an acceleration equivalent to a bullet fired from a pistol.

So how do these sedentary snails pull off such a high-octane feat? Hydrostatic pressure — the pressure from fluid — builds within the half of the snail’s proboscis closest to its body, locked behind a tight o-ring of muscle. When it comes time to strike, the muscle relaxes, and the venom-laced fluid punches into the harpoon’s bulbous base. This pressure launches the harpoon out into the snail’s unsuspecting prey.

As fast as the harpoon launches, it comes to an even more abrupt stop. The base of the harpoon gets caught at the end of the proboscis so the snail can reel in its meal.

The high-speed action doesn’t stop with the harpoon. Cone snail venom acts fast, subduing fish in as little as a few seconds. The venom is filled with unique molecules, broadly referred to as conotoxins. 

The composition of cone snail venom varies from species to species, and even between individuals of the same species, creating a library of potential new drugs that researchers are eager to mine. In combination, these chemicals work together to rapidly paralyze a cone snail’s prey. Individually, some molecules from cone snail venom can provide non-opioid pain relief, and could potentially treat Parkinson’s disease or cancer.

--- Where do cone snails live?

There are 500 species of cone snails living in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Caribbean and Red Seas, and the Florida coast.

--- Can cone snails kill humans?

Most of them do not. Only eight of those 500 species, including the geography cone, have been known to kill humans.

--- Why are scientists interested in cone snails?

Cone snail venom is derived from thousands of small molecules call peptides that the snail makes under its shell. These peptides produce different effects on cells, which scientists hope to manipulate in the treatment of various diseases.

“President Donald Trump's administration backed anti-government protesters in Iran Tuesday, seizing an opportunity to criticize not just a foreign government that the White House has framed as a chief foe but also the administration of Barack Obama.

Trump tweeted that “the U.S. is watching” the ongoing anti-government demonstrations across Iran, blaming the nuclear deal struck with the support of former President Obama for lining the pockets of the Iranian government.

“The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their ‘pockets,’” the president wrote on Twitter. “The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!”

Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the U.S. would call for emergency sessions of the United Nations security and human rights councils in New York and Geneva, respectively, to address the Iranian government’s crackdown on protesters. She said the Islamic Republic’s suggestion that the protests had been fueled by outside influences was “complete nonsense.”

Conquis, le public a longuement applaudi la star qui par le passé s’en est déjà pris au locataire de la Maison Blanche.    Mais la chaine de télévision américaine CBS, qui diffusait la cérémonie avec un différé de quelques secondes, a préféré censurer l’insulte de l’acteur américain, en diffusant un bip sonore au moment où l’acteur proférait les insultes. Motif : les mots et images jugés « indécents » sont interdits à la télé américaine entre 6 h du matin et 22 h. Malgré la coupe, des internautes ont massivement relayé les propos de de Niro sur les réseaux sociaux.

The Xbox One X has launched and fans of the incredible new system are eagerly awaiting Black Friday to get their hands on some awesome accessories. The system is already a powerhouse packed with cool features and some truly impressive tech but there are also a ton of add-ons out there to enhance the gaming experience even further. With the new, yet similar, design of the console, many accessories that fit the original and the S versions of the consoles might not work with the new system. There are new licensed versions of those products coming from Microsoft and numerous third-party companies jumping at the chance to offer products that fill gaps in the console accessory market.

There are, of course, many options when it comes to high-end peripherals and gadgets for the Xbox One X. External hard drives are a favorite as well as the Official Elite controllers, but those items are certainly pricey. Maybe you have a loved-one or friend who has an Xbox One X and you’re looking for a gift for that person. There are many options available for all sorts of accessories that are far less expensive than that eight terabyte external hard drive they’ve requested in writing from Santa. Perhaps, you have this new powerhouse of a system and are just looking for a little customization; some flair to show off when your friends come over. Or maybe you just want to show your new baby some affection to let it know how much you appreciate its ability to let you game in 4k. Either way, there is a cornucopia of great items for less that 25 dollars that can take the Xbox One X to the next level.

* Since my use of the chord lettering ""H"" has caused so much confusion, a little explanation is in order:

This originates many hundreds of years ago when some sheet music arrived from Italy into Germany. They mistook the letter ""b"" for ""h"" and thus the confusion begun.
Many countries in Europe, not only Germany use the letter ""H"" where many other countries, among them USA would use the letter ""B"".
I come from Scandinavia and we've always used the letter ""H"" for this chord and note.
If I'd known at the time I made this video that so many from other countries would watch the video, I would have used ""B"" and I have been doing so in every other video coming after this.
In short, just use ""B"" where I say ""H"" and you""re good to go. ""Hm7=Bm7 etc.. *

Have you ever wondered why 80s pop music sounds so different from pop music made today?
I show you why and I explain how you can make your own tracks the same way.

This is primarily a tutorial for beginners in the world of composition and for those who do not yet fully understand the importance of more complex chords and chord progression. I've simplified some chords and theory for this very reason. :)

I dissect 4 famous hit songs from the 80s and show you how you can use the same principles to make your OWN hit song.

I go through how they used more elegant chords and transitions than they often use today and how melody and chords go together to create the feelings your after. I also show how modulation works to really lift a section in a song.

The songs I dissect are:

The Neverending Story - Limahl / Giorgio Moroder
True  - Spandau Ballet
If You Leave Me Now - Chicago
Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley

Although ""If you leave me now"" was written in the 70s (as is the original ""Greatest love of all"") the tradition in which the song is written was well carried over into the 80s and in Europe that Chicago song was a hit in the early 80s as well.)

My own music pay homage to all synth-pop acts of the 80'ies like Howard Jones, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, New Order, Thompson Twins, Tears for Fears, Ultravox, OMD, Euryhmics, Duran Duran, Giorgio Moroder, Jean Michel Jarre, Jan Hammer, Alphaville, A-ha and many more.

A use mostly old gear in my music and among them Roland Juno 6, Alpha Juno 2, D550 and JX-8P. 
Korg DW-8000, Elka EK22,  Yamaha DX7 and TX802 and drum machines Yamaha RX11 and Roland TR-626.
 
Effects are usually handled by Strymon and TC electronics.

After having internet issues earlier in the night, I returned for my last last last run of the night, managed to pull off the Pandora's Box glitch and get a workable combo early on! Enjoy the madness that follows... 

The glitch can be achieved if you immediately choose Pandora's Box when offered (at any point - either after a boss or when trading in your relic for a random boss relic at the start of the game). If done rapidly enough, the Return button (the red ribbon on the left) can still be clicked, causing all your transformed Strikes and Defends to be removed from your deck. If you do this at the start of the game, this leaves you with nothing but a Bash in the deck, and shenanigans can be had, as in the video above.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jb68ZZkLbkI/sddefault.jpg,0.016785910842047332,0.0006707484865162356,25.025641025641022,0.0013414969730324712,0.017456659328563558,0.01879815630159604,2018-03-09,03:09:10,Friday,4,7,8,7,8,49,68,3,19,0,0,6,0,0,1,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.6604776154987775,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Type confusion, often combined with use-after-free, is the main attack vector to compromise modern C++ software like browsers or virtual machines. Typecasting is a core principle that enables modularity in C++. For performance, most typecasts are only checked statically, i.e., the check only tests if a cast is allowed for the given type hierarchy, ignoring the actual runtime type of the object. Using an object of an incompatible base type instead of a derived type results in type confusion. Attackers have been abusing such type confusion issues to compromise popular software products including Adobe Flash, PHP, Google Chrome, or Firefox, raising critical security concerns.

We discuss the details of this vulnerability type and how such vulnerabilities relate to memory corruption. Based on an LLVM-based sanitizer that we developed, we will show how to discover such vulnerabilities in large software through fuzzing and how to protect yourself against this class of bugs.

C++ is popular in large software projects that require both the modularity of object-oriented programming and the high efficiency offered by low-level access to memory and system intrinsics. Examples of such software are Google Chrome, Microsoft Windows, Mozilla Firefox, or Oracle's JVM.  Unfortunately, C++ enforces neither type nor memory safety. This lack of safety leads to type confusion vulnerabilities that can be abused to attack programs.  Type confusion arises when the program interprets an object of one type as an object of a different type due to unsafe typecasting, leading to reinterpretation of memory areas in different contexts.  For instance, a program may cast an instance of a parent class to a descendant class, even though this is not safe if the parent class lacks some of the fields or virtual functions of the descendant class. When the program subsequently uses these fields or functions, it may use data, say, as a regular field in one context and as a virtual function table (vtable) pointer in another. Exploitable type confusion bugs have been found in a wide range of software products, such as Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-3077), Microsoft Internet Explorer (CVE-2015-6184), PHP (CVE-2016-3185), and Google Chrome (CVE-2013-0912). According to Microsoft, type confusion is the 4th most common vulnerability type in their bug bounty program (after use-after-free, memory corruption, and heap out-of-bounds read) with the majority of type confusion bugs also fitting into one of the earlier categories.

We have developed an extension to the Clang/LLVM compiler that detects type-confusion bugs with low overhead and high coverage. Our prototype consists of two parts: an object tracing facility and typecasting verification. Such an enforcement mechanism is useful as a runtime monitor and online defense mechanism to protect applications against attacks. In a development setting, the mechanism can be combined with a fuzzing framework to detect type confusion before the underlying memory corruption triggers.

In this talk we will first discuss how type safety protects against type confusion-based attacks. We will then introduce our prototype implementation and show how it actively defeats realistic attacks. Finally, we show how to leverage type safety in a fuzzing framework to find security vulnerabilities faster.  We will release all components as open-source.

We introduce the concept of a type sanitizer that checks all casts in an application (replacing static casts with fully explicit runtime checks) and show how we have developed a low-overhead framework for these checks. Building on this framework we argue that it can be used as a runtime monitor in an always on configuration to protect users against attacks and how developers, security researchers, and hackers can use it to find new vulnerabilities in real software.

The expected audience includes people interested in system software, reverse engineering, fuzzing, type confusion-based attacks, and memory corruption-based attacks and their defense mechanisms. General programming and low-level knowledge is expected but the talk will be self contained and does not expect the audience to know the upcoming defense mechanisms or attacks.

Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.

Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.

Mama, ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine,
Body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.

Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),
I don't wanna die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning,
Very, very frightening me.
(Galileo) Galileo.
(Galileo) Galileo,
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico-o-o-o-o.

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
Oh oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

(Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

Any way the wind blows.

Hope you like it :)

How does Apple's latest attempt at using software to overcome hardware limitations compare with a professional DSLR camera? Let's find out together!

The images from the iPhone X do not have any post-processing applied to them aside from using the long exposure mode. The DSLR shots were processed using Lightroom/Photoshop. Slow motion footage was also shot on the iPhone X in the new 240fps/1080 mode.

FAQs

-What do you film with? Canon 750d  http://bit.ly/2fWUQ7f
Sigma 30mm Lens http://bit.ly/2hj8GBI 
-Why is your channel called sophdoesnails? I started my Instagram account a couple years before Youtube, where I did loads of nail art. When I started youtube I wanted to keep the same name so I was easier to find! Nail videos are too difficult to film + I prefer makeup!
-What's wrong with your fingers? I have dermatophagia

It must be a strange existence having Floyd Mayweather as your promoter.

Not only is there uncertainty over whether the Money has officially retired or whether he will make a shock comeback in the Octagon, he has been accused at times of talking down his own fighters and even focusing a little too much on his own cult of personality.

These are just some of the challenges Gervonta Davis is having to contend with right now.

The American made it known that he was not happy with Mayweather offering him out to Vasyl Lomachenko.

Despite the Ukranian having only fought 12 professional bouts, absolutely no-one in their right mind would want to step into a ring with him.

Indeed, even when Davis won his IBF belt by knocking out Jose Pedraza, he subsequently claimed in an Instagram post that he had been ""forced"" into fighting him.

In an interview with FightHype this weekend, the 23-year-old vamped up the tension even more by responding to a question asking him to grade his promoter with: ""no comment"".

""We don’t have beef...We’re not seeing eye to eye...he travelling, doing him, and I’m doing me. I’m travelling,"" he added.“Two years [I have a contract with Mayweather].

""I think I’m supposed to get like three fights. I mean, they been moving me right...Mayweather Promotions been moving me right, doing what they supposed to be doing with me. It’s just Floyd.”

And while nobody knows whether Mayweather regularly checks his fighters' social media presences, but he will surely soon hear of Davis' latest jibe at him, which came via a cryptic tweet:

LOL to that... The power gains from this will not really be noticeable, but in the higher rpm range, it does pick up quicker than stock.  It really just makes the truck sound really good!  Combined with the AFE exhaust I installed its a great pair to add a great sound and some power!

Professional Big Wave Surfer, Sebastian Steudtner catches one of the Biggest Waves of the season during a recent Giant Swell in Praia do Norte, Nazaré Portugal. Local Drone team “Máquina Voadora - Produções” captures the wave and the successful rescue from a close angle, flying at very low altitude and almost loosing their drone in the process, the resulting footage is quite overwhelming and spectacular.

Sebastian Steudtner, 32 years old, is a Professional Big Wave Surfer from Germany and one of the top Big Riders worldwide, Steudtner is a 2 times winner of the WSL Biggest Wave Award, a prize won both in the 2010 and 2015 edition of the “Oscars” of Big Wave Surfing, an award given to the single biggest wave ridden worldwide during the entire year, and one of the most respected prizes given in Big Wave Surfing. Sebastian Steudtner leave his hometown of Nuremberg at the age of 16 and moved to Hawaii where he got to know big wave surfing, ultimately leading him to a successful career in the industry.

This swell originated from a North Atlantic storm and produced some of the biggest and heaviest waves the town has seen in years, reaching the 80ft mark on Thursday, January 18th, 2018. Some of the biggest names in Big Wave Surfing have descent on Praia do Norte, in Nazaré - off the coast of Portugal, to ride the Biggest Swell since 2014. Locals already call the day “The Big Thursday”, the same name given to the infamous swell of 2014, also on a Thursday.

Benjamin Sanchis, Ross Clarke-Jones, Sebastian Steudtner, Maya Gabeira, Hugo Vau, Alex Botelho, Marcelo Luna, Axi Munian, Andrey Karr, João Guedes, Roland Pierre and many other Professional Big Wave Surfers were in the water, several monster waves were ridden that most likely will end up nominated for the WSL Big Wave Awards, as footage continues to be released.

Praia do Norte beach, near the fishing village of Nazaré, has become famous for huge waves since Hawaiian surfer Garrett McNamara set a then-record in 2011 for the largest wave ever surfed, when he rode a 78-foot wave.

Could Darth Sidious have healed Anakin/Darth Vader fully? 
How does this theory play into the rest of Star Wars? If Mace Windu could use both the light and dark sides, why couldn't Palpatine? I believe he could and DID! 

How will this play into Snoke and Kylo Ren's relationship in Star Wars the Last Jedi? Will Luke Skywalker be able to use both the light and dark as well?

Thanks for watching everyone! Just one or two more days now! Have an awesome day and I'll see you all in the next episode of Star Wars Theory, until then, my fellow Jedi and Sith friends, remember, the FORCE will be with YOU...Always!!!!

Saturday Sun🎙️🎹Lyrics

[Verse 1]
So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She fell at rest in her hair
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's goin' on?
'Cause I've been undone
The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

[Verse 2]
And still the memory's right there
She put the breeze in my hair
No kiss was softer, softer than this
I'm readin' her lips, oh
Each line I read
She left her books in my bed
And her song in my head
I've been undone

[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

I also play in a Pirate Folk Metal band: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCnttPJHt6s

This instrument is called ""hurdy gurdy"" and has its roots in the medieval times. It works like a mechanical violin with a wheel bow, that can play bass, melody and rhythm all at once.

Philippe Coutinho was able to join in with some of the exercises with his new team-mates, but is still not match fit. The Brazilian will be staying at home this weekend along with the also injured Ousmane Dembélé, Paco Alcácer, Andrés Iniesta and Javier Mascherano.

Rafinha was given special permission by the club to miss the session and will not be travelling to Andalusia either.

Neither will Denis Suárez and Yerry Mina. Although the latter has now been officially cleared to play after his transfer went through, Valverde strongly hinted at his pre-match press conference that he would rather give the Colombian more time to adapt to a new country and a new team.

The full squad for the game with Betis at 8.45pm CET is therefore as follows: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Piqué, Rakitic, Sergio Busquets, Suárez, Messi, Cillessen, Paulinho, Deulofeu, Jordi Alba, Digne, Sergi Roberto, André Gomes, Aleix Vidal, Umtiti, Vermaelen and Aleñá.

Video games are a large operation with a massive budget, but even the best intentions won’t save developers from making a few mistakes along the way.

This is The Gamer’s list of 10 video game mistakes developers made without getting caught. What’s the funniest mistakes you’ve ever seen in a video game? Let us know in the comments section below!

The creation of a video game from concept to completion is a huge task to accomplish. There are teams of people working on a single title at any given time and each one of them has their own job to undertake. Each of these parts, eventually, take shape together to create an entire, cohesive game. With so much work going into each and every video game title, one would think that mistakes are few and far between. Unfortunately, mistakes happen no matter what precautions are taken.

There is no amount of foresight which will rid a video game of mistakes entirely. The bigger the title, the bigger the mistakes seem to be and, although, there are teams upon teams of employees working toward the same goal, everyone is human. There is no way that every mistake will be caught and rectified prior to release. Most developers are aware of this no matter how much they attempt to combat mistakes in their own games. Thankfully, some developers are at least capable of laughing off their mistakes in hopes that they turn into a pop culture meme.

However, some mistakes in video games are just inherently funny. From bad translation to forgotten doors, most players can see the humor in these mistakes since they understand the amount of work that goes into creating a video game. Even though mistakes can be irritating to developers, they’re still funny nonetheless and some of them have even achieved legendary meme status over the years. Here are 10 video game mistakes developers made without getting caught. Enjoy!

Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7

Do cars need back pressure? How should you size an exhaust? What exhaust diameter is too large, or too small? What is exhaust scavenging? What is wave scavenging? Why is exhaust velocity important? 

Cars don't need back pressure. More specifically, internal combustion engines do not benefit from back pressure in the exhaust. Back pressure is a pressure in the opposite direction to the exhaust's flow. The goal of an exhaust is remove spent combustion gases as quickly and efficiently as possible out of the engine cylinders. Back pressure has the opposite effect, impeding exhaust flow. 

Exhaust velocity, and exhaust scavenging, however, are highly beneficial. This video will discuss wave scavenging, inertial scavenging, and how exhaust pipe length and diameter play a critical role in exhaust velocity and scavenging effectiveness.

After a popular teen dies mysteriously, her best friend basks in the social media attention while a rival seeks to uncover the truth. 

Cast: Caitlin Carver, Madison Iseman, Austin Cauldwell, Daniela Bobadilla

Rachel Nelson and Rachel Richards are the self-designated queens of their high school. Known collectively as “The Rachels,” the girls seem to be best friends… until Rachel Nelson mysteriously falls to her death.

For this list, we’re looking at both group dates and one-on-ones that appeared on either “The Bachelor” or “The Bachelorette.” We’ve included the zero gravity dates, the sports illustrated photo shoot date, the fake wedding date, the k-pop date, the bikini skiing date, the love lab date, the roast date, and more.

He joins us with his new book 'Playing with Fire: The 1968 Election and the Transformation of American Politics', chronicling the tumult of the Nixon era and the human drama of a system—and a country—coming apart at the seams in real time. Nearly 50 years later we find ourselves again in a moment of political uncertainty and crisis, and we reflect with O’Donnell on the seminal 1968 election which he asserts is still shaping our political landscape today. O’Donnell demonstrates his master-class in electioneering and explains how the fallout from Nixon’s election and administration set the stage for American politics as we know it.

Lawrence O’Donnell is the host of ‘The Last Word’ on MSNBC. Formerly an Emmy Award-winning executive producer and writer for The West Wing, O’Donnell also served as senior advisor to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chief of staff to the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and the Senate Finance Committee. He is the author of Deadly Force and his writing has appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times.

Here is the data: https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2ahob0949mmj3s/Wallet%20Data%20Aggragate.xlsx?dl=0

Summary:  I lost my wallet.  That made me curious about what kind of person doesn't return a found wallet.  So I got 200 wallets and dropped them in 10 cities to collect data to rank the honesty of the cities and to build a profile of an honest person.  We looked at variables such as male v. female, age, high income v. low income, religious v. non-religious, small town v. big town.  


MERCH-

►Lyrics

Keep me connected, to you
Like I was your shadow
You're givin' me answers
To all of my questions
Here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait

When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

Just turn off the lights
And you could be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all the manners
The neighbors must think we're crazy, baby
Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait

When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Kim Sung Kyu(김성규)]

Everything about Kim Sung Kyu and his 10 stories. “KIM SUNG KYU THE 1ST ALBUM [10 Stories]”

This album like the stories talked with Kim Sung Kyu described love, breakup, longing, despair and regret empathized by his generation, breaking out of the responsible position as a leader of the idol group INFINITE. On one side, every story that started from ‘the current myself’ was spoken in his appealing voice. The title track ‘True love’ was co-composed by SPACEBOY, who was one of the first Korean composers of DeF Jam Recordings, and Kim Jong Wan. The cool development and sound from the beginning to the end of the alternative pop that is made of the strength of three musicians makes us completely focusing on the stories of Kim Sung Kyu.

The couple's visit to Nottingham was their first official commitment since they announced their engagement on Monday.
They plan to tour Britain over the next six months to give Markle an opportunity to learn about the country before their May wedding in the chapel at Windsor Castle.
The couple travelled to the east Midlands in England to visit to a youth project and to raise AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) awareness.
The trip was Prince Harry's third to Nottingham since October 2016.
The prince has long championed AIDS charities, following in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana.

jt_fD6Xlf6c,hRAGY4BaFQs,Why Brandy Looks Pregnant Even Though She's Not,Lailah Lynn,24.0,2017-11-29 15:57:03+00:00,"['brandy pregnant', 'brandy norwood', 'brandy surrogate', 'brandy ray j', 'brandy norwood pregnant', 'brady baby bump', 'brandy weight gain', 'ray j princess love pregnant', 'brandy baby']",151898.0,890.0,131.0,513.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jt_fD6Xlf6c/default.jpg,"It's not a baby or baby fat that's making Brandy look pregnant.

The pregnancy rumors started swirling for Brandy around May of this year, when her abdomen began to bulge.

And when she fell unconscious on a Delta airlines flight, a lot of people really thought that she was expecting and just wasn't ready to announce it.

Pictures of Brandy looking pregnant continued to surface over the summer.  And in a video of her performing with Bell Biv Devoe, she really looked like she was hiding a pregnancy.  She wore a flowing red dress that could easily hide a baby bump, so even I was wondering if she was expecting a child with her then boyfriend Sir The Baptist.

However, Brandy has denied all pregnancy claims.  She even updated her social media bios with a statement saying she is not pregnant.

People, I'm not pregnant!!!"" both her Twitter and Instagram bios read. ""I got too much work to do. I just like pancakes and chocolate cake... let me live!!

And her daughter, Syrai Iman, denied the rumors as well.  She posted on her social media ""My mother is not pregnant. I'm not going to have any more siblings.  I like being an only child.  Thank you Lord. She just ate chocolate cake and pancakes everyday. I was there.""

Looking at these pictures of Brandy, I don't think that bulge is coming from cake, pancakes, or any other food.

I actually think Brandy is suffering from fibroids, which are making her look pregnant.

The Facts

Fibroids are firm, compact tumors that are made of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissue that develop in the uterus.  Fibroids can appear as a single large benign tumor, a cluster of small benign tumors, or mix of both.

African American women are nearly three times more likely to develop uterine fibroids and suffer with more severe symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, and pelvic pain.

Some women can have tumors so large that they are physically noticeable. Because of this, a woman with fibroids MAY APPEAR BLOATED OR EVEN PREGNANT when in fact, she is not.  And I think that is the case when it comes to Brandy.

 My Opinion

Her abdomen is clearly swollen, which we've seen in picture after picture.  And I think fibroids may be the cause.

She's Not Alone

If you watch Real Housewives of Atlanta, then you may remember a couple of seasons ago Cynthia actually dealt with having fibroids on the show.  They also caused her abdomen to protrude.  And if she were younger she probably would have had pregnancy rumors swirling about her too.

She shared in a Bravo blog that she first found about her fibroids almost 15 years ago when she was pregnant with her daughter Noelle.  She chose to undergo a procedure on the show called uterine fibroid embolization.  Uterine fibroid embolization blocks the arteries that provide blood to the fibroids and causes them to shrink.

R & B singer Monica also underwent surgery for fibroids in addition to endometriosis earlier this year.  She shared in an Instagram post:

""May 30th I had an almost 8 hour surgery to remove my endometriosis (which I didn't know I had until two weeks prior) , 2 cysts, fibroids & a hernia that all were making me very sick...I've known something was wrong but I also knew victory & better health would be near again!!""

Brandy has not been as open about her health as Cynthia & Monica, but it looks to me like her problem is the same as theirs was.  She's just blaming food for her weight gain.  But weight gain is also a side effect of having fibroids, which I really think she has.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jt_fD6Xlf6c/sddefault.jpg,0.0058591949861091,0.0008624208350340361,6.793893129770992,0.0033772663234538968,0.006721615821143136,0.01009888214459703,2017-11-29,15:57:03,Wednesday,2,8,25,8,18,47,188,1,28,0,0,7,0,3,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.705514725036062,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 5},5

Two polar bears, a mother and her cub, clamber over the sea ice with the pink winter sky glowing behind them. “These are the moments I live for,” says nature photographer Joshua Holko.

High in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, Holko is on a mission to document polar bears in the wild. Braving the elements for up to 16 hours a day, he is joined on his quest by cinematographers Abraham Joffe and Dom West of Untitled Film Works. Despite technical issues and frostbite due to the subzero temperatures, the crew persisted in the depths of winter to capture the haunting beauty of this frozen expanse.

In Ghosts of the Arctic, get up close to polar bears in their natural habitat and experience the breathtaking Arctic landscape in stunning detail.

AVENGERS... ASSEMBLE!
Actually, that might be kind of problematic after the events of Avengers: Infinity War - which, for the record, was an absolutely astonishing movie! If you haven't seen it yet, what on Earth are you playing at?!
The movie world has been left genuinely gobsmacked by the third Avengers installment and fans simply can't wait for the as-yet-untitled sequel.
Unfortunately, that movie isn't getting released until 2019, which is frustrating to say the least - but at least we can all talk about it in the meantime and theorise what might happen!
We already know from set photos that the movie will involve time travel and it's been confirmed that Thanos will return. But what else might happen?
In this video, we're going to take a look. Here are ten Avengers 4 predictions after Infinity War - and, of course, this video contains spoilers, so don't watch it if you don't want to know what happened.
The predictions are; that Captain Marvel will be the MVP of Avengers 4, that Hawkeye, Ant-Man and the Wasp will also be very important in the movie, that Doctor Strange will be revealed to be alive, that there will be a number of surprise characters appearing, that many dead characters will be resurrected, that some characters will die permanently, that Adam Warlock will make his MCU debut, that Thanos will have his head removed, that the entire reality of the MCU will be altered, and that the Illuminati will be formed.
We hope you enjoy the video! Thanks for watching! Please leave a comment letting us know what you thought of it. And don't forget to subscribe to Screen Rant's YouTube channel, so you never miss our great new videos in the future.

 ABOUT GHOST RECON WILDLANDS: 
 
 The Santa Blanca drug cartel has transformed the beautiful South 
 playAmerican country of Bolivia into a perilous narco-state, leading to lawlessness, fear, and rampant violence. The citizens of Bolivia have been plagued by the criminal influence of the cartel, but all hope is not lost. Now only the Ghosts, an elite US Special Forces team, can save the country from complete collapse.
 
 Armed with their tactical prowess and the latest weapons technology, the Ghosts will have to go deep behind enemy lines to complete their most dangerous mission to date. They’ll have to annihilate the alliance between the corrupted government and the cartel before the evil rises above Bolivia to become a major threat across the globe.
 
 Facing an almighty adversary in a massive, hostile environment, you will have to muster your strength, hone your skills, and sharpen your mettle to become a Ghost and take Bolivia back from its criminal tyrants.
 
 YOU DECIDE YOUR WORLD
 
 The Wildlands are a living, reactive open-world environment where every individual choice you make has far reaching consequences. With the Faction Influence System, turn each dangerous situation into an advantage by seizing control of the cartel’s traffic patterns, patrols, and movements.
 
 YOU DECIDE THE CARTEL’S FATE
 
 Play every mission the way you want: utilize stealth to take the enemy down quietly, develop a plan and execute it to perfection to strategically eliminate all targets, or just get your hands on the most lethal weapons you can find and come out guns blazing.
 
 YOU DECIDE WHERE TO EXPLORE
 
 Journey through Ubisoft's largest action-adventure open world and discover the diverse landscapes of the most beautiful (and dangerous) place on Earth, from the arid mountains to the lush jungles. Explore Bolivia on and off road, in the air, on land, and at sea with over 60 different vehicles.

Just a week into 2018, Donald Trump tweeted a provocative message directed at the North Korean regime's leader, Kim Jong Un. His message cited a ""nuclear button"", and claimed that his was much larger than Kim's. But how does the U.S. protocol for launching nuclear warheads actually work? It's a process that's designed to be fast - there are only a few steps. But it's still more complicated than a simple button.

The first thing which you would like to do is to adjust the home screen to your liking. To change that you can click and hold on the home screen and press settings and then you will see the option of home screen layout where you can change the grid as well as icon size to your liking.

- Face Unlock without Lockscreen (Remove swipe up gesture/ or probably add because it's very fast)
Face unlock on Oneplus 5T is unimaginably fast! By default, it is set to skip the lock screen which is great but its soo fast that you might want to take a moment to watch the time or see the notifications and you can do that by going in settings, fingerprint and face data.


- Pocket mode and OTG support (Settings-Advanced)
OnePlus has been giving pocket mode feature since Oneplus 3 which disables accidental clicks when your phone is in your pocket. It is in the settings and advanced tab. 
You will also notice there's an OTG support option which is turned off. You can turn that on whenever you want to use the OTP pen drive. 

- Show battery Percentage  and internet speed (Settings-Status bar)
OnePlus 5T by default doesn't show battery percentage and let's just agree its essential so to enable that you can go to settings and then status bar where you will have battery percentage option as well as there's an option to show internet speed on the status bar

- Dark theme and Accent Color (Settings-Display)
Another default setting on the OnePlus 5T is the light theme along with blue accent color which you can change by going in settings and then display. There are tons of color which you can use as an accent color as you can see it over here.

- Double tap to wake and gestures (Settings- Gestures)
You can also enable the double tap to wake gesture from the gesture settings which might be very useful considering you don't have the fingerprint on the front side. Other gestures like O, V, M etc are still present just like previous OnePlus devices.  

- Easy One-hand usage (Swipe down on Home screen)
OnePlus 5T has the massive screen and no matter how big your hand is it's impossible to reach the top of the screen, to overcome that problem, click and hold on the home screen and go to settings, you'll see the swipe down feature over there which will bring the notification panel down when you swipe down anywhere on the home screen

-  Fingerprint Gestures (Settings-Gestures // Notification bar and Photo)
Although I'm not a big fan of fingerprints at the back of the phone, there are few advantages of it like fingerprint gestures in the gesture settings which will allow you to swipe down on fingerprint to bring the notification panel down. You can also click a picture by long pressing on the fingerprint

-  16:9 Resolution for Non-Supported apps (Settings-Apps-FullScreenapps)
18:9 is the future of smartphone displays but there are still few apps which don't support this ratio. To use an app in 16:9 mode go to settings apps and then fullscreen app. This will add a bezel or a bar at the top and bottom of the screen to make it work properly.

-  Hide Navigation Bar (Use Full Screen)
This device also comes with an option to hide the Navbar to enjoy the full screen of the OnePlus 5T. You can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring back the nav bars when you want to use them. 

-  Inbuilt App Locker (Settings-security and fingerprint)
Just like previous versions of the OnePlus devices. OnePlus 5T also comes with a trick to lock apps via your pin or fingerprint right into the security settings of the OnePlus 5T. 
I would love if it also had the face unlock feature to access apps instead of PINs

- Gaming - Do not disturb 
If you are a gamer, then the Gaming do not disturb would be the most used feature by you on this device. It is in the advanced settings which disables all the notifications when you are playing a particular game and you can also answer calls directly on speaker so that there are no distractions in the gameplay",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jzxlrxOARUQ/sddefault.jpg,0.008724088479422885,0.0014232323671287644,6.129770992366412,0.0006844552605275737,0.01014732084655165,0.010831776107079224,2017-11-28,10:47:08,Tuesday,1,7,67,7,35,33,432,1,58,1,11,4,40,2,11,4.0,5.0,"['\\S ONEPLUS 577', '* TRICKS']","['\\S', 'ONEPLUS', '577', '*', 'TRICKS']",True,"['\\S', 'oneplu', '577', '*', 'trick']",5,5,17,1,1,1,0,6.730217108109263,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'cell phone': 1},1

Here is Drew Gooden's original review of some life hacks in case you haven't seen how ridiculous they can be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1DF3JLKTKA

And his most recent one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFOUK8OCopM

He's the only person I found in (okay lazily just a few minutes of googling) that has mentioned how frustrating life hack videos are.  He's was also one of my favorite viners I never went to Ovvo Javer.

“Days after the The New York Times published an investigative report detailing the Pentagon’s secret and supposedly defunct UFO research program, the military intelligence official who led the initiative is speaking out on one of the universe’s greatest mysteries.

“My personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone,” Luis Elizondo told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday night. 

Elizondo, who ran the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program during its tenure from 2007 to 2012, said he no longer works for the U.S. government. The Department of Defense says it shut down the initiative in 2012, but the Times reported that some backers say the program is still operating. 

“I will tell you unequivocally that through the observation ― scientific methodologies that were applied to look at this phenomenon ― that these aircraft ... are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the U.S. inventory nor in any foreign inventories that we are aware of,” he added. 

Elizondo told the Times that he resigned from his role leading the program in October and that a new successor was named.

Check out Elizondo’s full response in the video above.”

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The gorgeous Australian actress is in extremely high demand in Hollywood after a string of impressive performances in big movies like The Wolf of Wall Street, Suicide Squad, Goodbye Christopher Robin and I, Tonya.

As much as everyone knows how incredibly talented she is, there's a lot more to Robbie than just being a beautiful A-list star.

In this video, we'll take you through some of the most interesting facts about her personal life.

The facts in question are; that her husband Tom Ackerley was her housemate before she was romantically involved with him, that she loves animals and has a pet dog called ""Boo Radley"" (and she used to have a pet rat called ""Rat Rat""), that she turned down Playboy Magazine for the sake of her family, that she can't say the word ""home"" in different accents to her own, that her nickname is actually ""Maggot"" (no, really!), that she was roommates with The Addams Family star Christina Ricci, that her diet isn't one you'd typically associate with a gorgeous Hollywood star, that she's been accused of lying about her age, that she met Prince Harry and thought he was Ed Sheeran, and that she's actually something of a tomboy!

Formally designated 1I/2017 U1, it was discovered by Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, on 19 October 2017, 40 days after it passed its closest point to the Sun. When first seen, it was about 33,000,000 km (21,000,000 mi; 0.22 AU) from Earth (about 85 times as far away as the Moon), and already heading away from the Sun. Initially assumed to be a comet, it was reclassified as an asteroid a week later, and finally (6 November 2017) as the first of the new class of interstellar object.

ʻOumuamua is a small object, estimated to be about 230 by 35 meters (800 ft × 100 ft) in size. It has a dark red color, similar to objects in the outer Solar System. ʻOumuamua showed no signs of a comet tail despite its close approach to the Sun, and has significant elongation and rotation rate, so it is thought to be a metal-rich rock with a relatively high density. ʻOumuamua is tumbling rather than smoothly rotating, and it is moving so fast relative to the Sun that there is no chance it originated in the Solar System. It also means that ʻOumuamua cannot be captured into a solar orbit, so it will eventually leave the Solar System and resume traveling in interstellar space. ʻOumuamua's system of origin and the amount of time it has been traveling among the stars are unknown.

“Congressional Republicans delivered on their first major legislative accomplishment of the Trump era on Wednesday, when the House voted 224-201 to pass a $1.5 trillion tax package. The bill cuts individual rates for eight years and slashes the top corporate tax rate to 21 percent permanently.

The bill now goes to Trump for his signature, though it's not clear when he will sign it. The president, Vice President Pence and lawmakers hailed the victory and thanked each other for their work on the bill's passage on the White House lawn on Wednesday afternoon.

""I promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting,"" Trump said in a written statement earlier in the day. ""I would like to thank the members of Congress who supported this historic bill, which represents an extraordinary victory for American families, workers, and businesses.""

Republican lawmakers hoped to put the bill over the goal line a day earlier, after the House claimed victory in a 227-203 vote Tuesday afternoon, but hit a procedural hurdle. The Senate passed the bill with some slight tweaks in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a party-line vote, 51-48.”

Happy New Year, AC Family! Many of you may be enjoying your holidays at the moment, perhaps even traveling in this festive time! I too am currently on vacation for the holidays and am enjoying some beach and ocean, but as usual ants are always on my mind! 

This video explores the life of wild ants living on the remote, tropical islands of Maldives. Being secluded in the Indian Ocean makes the over 1,000 coral islands of Maldives a paradise getaway for human tourists during their holidays, but it also makes it a great destination for ant tourist.

Find out how vacationing ants can impact the ecosystem of a secluded beach island and what measures people are taking in order to control invasive insects from ecological destruction. This video is packed with incredible nature footage, including an ant war and an ant-ant cow symbiotic relationship that will blow your mind!

Fair number of people mentioning the spelling of extravert as extrovert, which is much more common and I probably should have used it in hindsight, but for context, extravert with an A is usually preferred for the ""I'm doing a psych report"" format, while extrOvert is more common in everyday common use to mean outgoing.

Ubisoft's procedural tech art team developed tools in Houdini - including for fresh water, power lines, sands, cliffs, biomes, fog density map, and a world map. Using Houdini Engine, these tools which were fully integrated into the Ubisoft game editor, so that game artists could craft the world using the Houdini tools from within in the game editor environment they're comfortable with.

Étienne explains how procedural workflows alleviate tedious and time-consuming tasks, to allow the game artists to focus on creating beautiful, immersive worlds and fun game play.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Born in 1947 in Nofire Hollow, Oklahoma, Studi and his Cherokee family spoke only their Native language in the home. It wasn't until first grade that he started to learn English, which was a shock to the family's system. He attended Murrow Indian Children's Home for the first few years of his schooling before transferring in ninth grade to Chilocco, where his father had also attended. At the school, he worked in one of the kitchens (giving him coveted access to the bakery) and later went into laundry and dry cleaning, starting a side business of his own to make a little money.

From Wikipedia:
Graduation is the third studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released on September 11, 2007, through Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2005 to 2007 at Chung King Studios, Sony Music Studios in New York City, at Chalice Studios and The Record Plant in Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from DJ Toomp, as well as Mike Dean, Nottz, Brian ""All Day"" Miller, Eric Hudson, Warryn Campbell, Gee Roberson, Plain Pat and Jon Brion. It features guest contributions from artists, including Mos Def, Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, DJ Premier and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The album's cover artwork was designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.

Inspired by indie rock bands and house music, Graduation marked a departure away from the ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases toward a more anthemic style of rap music that would function well while he was performing in large arenas. Toward this end, West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling from a wider spectrum of music genres. Lyrically, the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of Graduation towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West's previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).

The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 957,000 copies in its first week. It produced five singles, including the international hits ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"", ""Stronger"", and ""Good Life"". The coinciding release dates between Graduation and fellow rapper 50 Cent's Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The outcome of the competition marks a turning point in hip-hop culture, when the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was brought to an end.

Me and Ethan have been watching this Paramount Network (or UPN 2.0, or Paramoom as this will be referred to) since the minute the network launched. I have received word moments ago from him that this logo is wasting no time in being shown. So thanks to Ethan.

This comes from on demand print of Cops, I'd imagine that this will be used on newer episodes after the launch.

Abby knew her dad was sent to prison for larceny when she was a kid. But she didn’t understand why. 

When they came to StoryCorps, Ralph had been out of prison for five years, and Abby came to understand more fully what happened.

Ralph and Abby’s conversation was recorded through the StoryCorps Justice Project, which preserves and amplifies the stories of people who have been directly impacted by mass incarceration. Original support for the Justice Project was provided by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Safety and Justice Challenge, #RethinkJails and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation.

Each panelist drafted 8 films in descending order that they are most looking forward to and that have the potential for box office success. The panelists explain the reasons for their 8 selections and the rounds they chose them in. They also challenge each other’s choices in an effort to promote their list as the better overall list of 2018 films. The episode finishes off with each panelist choosing an extra 2018 film that they are most looking forward to. It’s a very lively discussion with some surprising choices.

Lyrics
(prehook Verse 1)
Our Cores all shine, don't got the time, to feel the life I'm living isn't fucking mine, Nah. Nah. x2
(Verse 1)
We need to learn to our fullest,
The things that make us special make us us,
We need to trust, that feeling in our guts
We're living on the cusp, of, love.
We're closer but further from loving eachother,
Won't here one another unless theres some paper,
Unless there's some paper.
(Hook interlude)
Following instead of leading,
Tell me how the fuck that's living,
Following instead of leading
Tell me how the fuck that's living
(Hook 1)
Shine, don't got the time, it's fucking mine,
Shine, don't got the time, it's fucking mine,
(Verse 2)
Keep growing, (keep growing)
I can never fall (I can never fall)
Keep breathing (keep breathing)
Giving it my all 
(Hook 2)
Shine, don't got the time, it's fucking mine,
Shine, don't got the time, it's fucking mine,
(Ending verses)
Shine, don't got the time.
Our cores all shine, don't got the time, to feel the life I'm living isn't mine.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kFN0N55FgC4/sddefault.jpg,0.025140194540120592,0.00044391847580220516,56.63245823389021,0.004919125258113696,0.0255841130159228,0.030503238274036486,2018-02-16,05:30:01,Friday,4,8,33,8,32,50,274,6,82,2,0,3,13,0,0,5.0,7.0,['VATION'],['VATION'],True,['vation'],1,1,6,0,0,0,0,6.381737538718102,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

In this VladTV exclusive, Gervonta Davis speaks on rumors about Mayweather fighting in the UFC. The young boxer thinks that Mayweather could possibly get $1 billion from only 3-4 UFC fights. Davis and Vlad also debate about Mayweather's career. 

They both question whether the UFC move would tarnish Mayweather's career. Vlad believes Mayweather is more concerned about his legacy while Davis thinks no harm can be done.

This instinctual nonverbal “messenger” is still the main factor that influences how others perceive us and can make people like you or, on the contrary, make you totally unattractive. Here's a quick guide to some gestures you should avoid to always look your best. 
Gripping your arm behind your back sends a strong negative signal to those around you. The higher you grab your arm, the angrier you seem to people.
Hiding your hands in your pockets means a lot of things, which is why it’s important to interpret body language as a whole. But in most cases people put their hands in their pockets when they're nervous.
Clasped hands resting on the table is a mini-version of crossing your arms over your chest. Sitting with your fingers laced together and your hands raised off the table sends the same message: “I’m shutting myself off, and I don’t want to talk to you.”
Instead of slouching, straighten your back, look ahead of you, and pick your feet up when you walk. These tips will improve your appearance even more than a new suit or a stunning dress!
While we usually put our hands on the lips simply because we don’t know where to put our hands, it’s still a pretty intimidating pose to see on a conversation partner. We unconsciously touch our mouth when we're lying and many people know this. Also, when you cover your mouth, it can be hard to understand what you're saying.
Clinching your hands looks like you’re literally about to punch someone in the face or you’re ready to defend yourself. 
Eye contact could be the most important part of communication. If you tend to maintain too much eye contact or you simply want to avoid doing so, try to fidget with something every once in a while, maybe lint on your pants or something in your salad. Just don’t overdo the fake distractions because you’ll seem impolite. 
There have been a lot of cool psychological studies on this topic, but to keep it short: we copy people who we like, and we like people who copy us.

SUMMARY
-When you grip your wrist or forearm behind your back, it sends a strong negative signal to those around you.
-Standing with your ankles crossed shows that you don't completely believe in the things you're saying.
-Clasped hands resting on the table send a message: “I’m shutting myself off, and I don’t want to talk to you.”
-The higher you place your arms on the table, the more you want to hide behind them.
-Slouching gives the impression that you feel helpless, unconfident, and miserable in life.
-People perceive such a tight-lipped smile as sarcasm and smugness. 
-Sitting at a table and talking to a person with your hand extended out towards them tells your conversation partner that you want them to stop talking.
-Standing with your hands on your hips says, “Well, what do you wanna tell me? I’ll probably disagree anyway!”
-Unless you’re actually hitch-hiking, don’t point your thumb behind you while talking to someone. This gesture can often be regarded as a sign of disrespect.
-Clinching your hands reveals hidden anger and fear.
-You shouldn't cover your mouth with your hand when you talk because the person you're speaking with might think that you're hiding something.
-We often shake our fingers at someone when we really want to convince someone of our point of view on a certain matter.
-Smile sincerely, don’t force or fake it. Eye contact is key. Tilt your head. Use your brows. “Mirror” the person you're talking to.

Overwatch One Trick's Vs Mains - what's the difference? Let me explain! Do NOT worry about getting banned for playing your best hero. The difference here is you will eventually pickup loads of reports for poor teamwork. Poor teamwork is playing the same hero in every game ignoring the enemies and your own teams comp! But is this fair? Should the community be left to dish out judgement on on tricks and players who insist on not playing as a team in Overwatch competitive?

Sometimes our kids don't listen to us until after we've asked them 10 times and resort to yelling. While we are training them, they are training us.

I share ways that encourage them to listen without any yelling.

2 Rules:
1. Some things you control, other things you don't.
2. Pay attention to the things you do control.

ABOUT THE FOUR
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

Talent Recap is the #1 independent website which is exclusively dedicated to the fans of the most popular talent shows around the world. As passionate fans of these shows, we provide news, analysis and fan engagement on America’s Got Talent, Britain’s Got Talent, The Voice, The X Factor, American Idol, The Four and its contestants.

Lyrics :
Rilès you're arrogant
You lift yourself up
You believed in your craft when nobody did
But we say arrogant
You dont know the game
You keep mentionning my name
""We dont like what you s-""

I don't give a fuck
Y'all can suck my dick
I'm making pesetas while they're talking talking shit
Nah I don't give a fuck
Don't waste my time for this
I'm making my dollars, dollars while they're tweeting tweets
Nah I don't give a 

Please don't wake my dirty self up
Please don't make me sane, nah nah
Please don't let me go look for you
The Internet is not safe
Please don't make me say what's next
Don't let me say it in French
Jay-Z's label on the phone
They're coming at the house on Monday
me say
Wow, wow, Great, great
Don't say too much they're gonna see what's next
They're hating on me cuz they ain't done shit
I'll forgive you cuz y'all giving me strength
say
Wow, wow, Great, great
They type too much 
But don't know shit 'bout shit
Do your research before comparing me
And you'll see this dude didn't make his hits so

fuck
Y'all can suck my dick
I'm making pesetas while they're talking talking shit
Nah I don't give a fuck
Don't waste my time for this
I'm making my dollars, dollars while they're tweeting tweets

Nah I don't give a fuck
Y'all can suck my dick
I'm making pesetas while they're talking talking shit
Nah I don't give a fuck
Don't waste my time for this
I'm making my dollars, dollars while they're tweeting tweets
Nah I don't give a 

They all want me dead
I piss them off
That's what I like to
You're sending me death threats in my mailbox
Mama we gon' move
Talk to me 'fore your talk 'bout me
Yeah that's the number 1 rule
Many want my head
But where's the crown?
It's on my balls fool
Wow, wow, Great, great
Don't show them that you've been loving yourself
Say you're ugly
Say you're not the best
Don't pump yourself up, they don't like them speeches
Wow, wow, Great, great
I do not go downtown
I'm feeling like hate & love are fighting for my vehemence
Now I got girls who want my d
And crazy dudes who want my hea..

wait..

I still don't give a fuck
Y'all can suck my dick
I'm making pesetas while they're talking talking shit
Nah I don't give a fuck
Don't waste my time for this
I'm making my dollars, dollars while they're tweeting tweets

Nah I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Y'all can suck it up, up, up, up, up
Imma let you talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
While I'm making more, more, more, more, more

Nah I don't give a fuck

DISCLAIMER

Occasionally I am lucky enough to be sent products/clothing free of charge by PR companies, meaning, I may not have paid for everything I talk about. I am not in ANY way obligated to mention these products and if I have done so, it is because I genuinely like them. I would NEVER talk about or show something I didn't genuinely love.

Sometimes, I may be sponsored by brands for videos. I turn down 90% of sponsorship opportunities. I will not accept unless I love the brand/product already. All products/items will still have been chosen by myself, and the video concept will always be my own idea. I would never endorse a brand/product that I didn't truly love and believe in.

I use affiliate links in the description box of this channel. This means I earn a very small percentage when you purchase a product I recommend- the same way a sales associate in a store earns commission when they help you select a product. This does not in any way affect the price you pay for the item, and absolutley does not influence my choice of items to show you.

Lots of love,

피타씨는 통가 근육남만의 특별한 바디오일 사용법을 전수해주시고 (참기름 바른거 아니래요! ㅋㅋ), 어쩌다 정신차리고보니 저희 다 같이 옷을 벗고 몸에 오일을 바르고 있더라고요!! 근데 다행히도 그것만 한건 아니랍니다 - 그들이 전세계 언론의 관심을 받게된 배경 뒤에 있는 숨은 스토리, 그리고 그들이 전하고 싶은 메시지에 대한 얘기를 나눠봅니다. 그리고 당연히 엄청 맛있는 한국 음식을 먹어보죠.

진정한 멕시코사람답게 헤르만씨는 제가 가능하다고 생각했던 것보다 훨씬 많은 청양고추를 드시더라고요. 그리고 평창 올림픽 선수촌 식당에서 가장 인기가 많은 요리가 뭔지 알려주셨어요!! 저희 최근에 촬영한 영상 중에 제일 재밌었던 것 뿐만아니라 정말 성공적인 두분을 한꺼번에 모시고 얘기를 나눌 수 있어서 정말 잊을 수 없는 시간이었어요. 여러분들도 재밌게 봐주셨음 좋겠네요!

Pita the Topless Tongan Olympic Opening Ceremony legend, and German the Mexican Cross Country Skier who finished dead last as an absolute hero! Today we bring you them both together in the highlights of one of the most epic shows we have ever filmed!!

Pita shows us how he oils up to look so good (apparently the secret isn't sesame oil, believe it or not!😂), and somehow in that process we all end up shirtless and oiled!! But thankfully it doesn't end there - they both go on to explain the real backstory and message they represent behind all the media attention. And of course, we eat some incredible Korean food.

As a true Mexican, German eats more raw chillies than I knew was possible, and we find out which type of food is most popular at the Pyeongchang Olympics Athlete's village!! This is the most fun we've had filming in a long time, and not only that but really an unforgettable privilege to get these two men who have achieved so much to chat and eat with. Really hope you guys enjoy it also!

[KIM DONG RYUL]

Beautiful loneliness, tranquilly we look into it – KIM DONG RYULL 'Reply'
When listening to the title song “Reply”, you may get different feelings from his previous title songs while it still sounds monologue.  A pain with regret, but somehow would be recovered as time goes by.  The song tells the feelings founded at last rather than telling sadness and regrets, which makes us feel sad but at the same time feel comforted.  So ‘we’ can be together.  The song makes its singer and listener say to each other that ‘everything is okay’.

Lyrics: 
Pardon me, summer scene.
You found me and finders keep.
You're why I'm sitting here making up songs in my room
Ad-libbing around like bum bum bum bum.
You're why I keep my Texas sleep hours on tour
Instead of sleeping around like bum bum—
Mind your head
I've lost my mind
From thinking about
Thinking about you all the time
Mind, your head
Has lost it's sight 
From thinking about
Thinking about you all the time
The la-la-la lobotomy
Has taken all of-all of me.
The la-la-la lobotomy
Took all but you
So let me go, let me go down.
Pardon me, cutting sleep
I'm taking up grinding teeth.
You're why I'm sitting here hating myself for needing someone so bad and feeling dumb dumb dumb dumb
If why I'm sitting here all goes wrong
Just push me back to Texas walking bum bum-God damn.
Let's both talk in circles like infinity signs
'Cause this won't last forever if we both wanna die, right?

On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Wednesday, December 6th 2017) John discusses the following topics:

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Bryan Kruse - I’m curious how you see The Disaster Artist doing at the box office. The casual movie fan probably has no clue what The Room is. Could that turn off a lot of people from seeing the movie since they don't know what it is about?

PATREON Supporter Mr. Moody - 'm a long time fan and congrats on hitting 100,000 Subscribers. My question is, if the Disney/Fox deal does go through? what could it mean for James Cameron's 75 Avatar sequels? Could it stay with Disney or would Cameron try and find a new company to distribute it? Thank you for being a huge positive influence on the internet and in my life.

Sam Rider- Hey John, love the show, watch whenever I can. With the rumors about Disney's acquisition of several assets from Fox's movie division, I've heard a lot of people skeptical that this could give Disney too much power and allow them to have a monopoly. Do you think this is a legitimate claim? Keep doing what you're doing!

Alex Rivera - Hey John. Great show! Have you looked into Ben Affleck’s cancelled JL  film scrip which was released online? If so, what do you make of it? I read it and it could have made for a better JL movie.

My question is:  How much will we be seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy cast in Avengers:  Infinity War.  Are they only going to be in the space sequences or are they going to be in New York and Wakanda?

While we all know some things are better left unsaid, these celebs said it anyway...

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

Lyrics:

Little boy's supposed to do what he's told
Little girl's supposed to polish her toes
Maybe they're together when they're older and all grown up
Daddy's supposed to put bread on the table
Daddy's gone and your mama ain't able
Are you hungry when the money's all run out?

Tell me little dear if you only lived here
Did you really ever live at all
Cause you'd be amazed in the summer how the days
Of the spring turn into fall
Just listen to your brother
You can run in the cover of the night sky when it falls
I know that you think that you're growing
But you're just tall

Ooh-ooh-ooh

A really pretty girl in a really small town
Easy to believe you that you never settle down
Mama told your mama just to say not long ago
You want a baby, the same as your friends
Ring'll find on your finger, and your story will end
You'll be lookin' 'round, wonder where did the time go?

Tell me little dear if you only lived here
Did you really ever live at all
Cause you'd be amazed in the summer how the days
Of the spring turn into fall
Just listen to your brother
You can run in the cover of the night sky when it falls
I know that you think that you're growing
But you're just tall

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Woah-oh
Don't you think I know
There never was a red light in our town
Woah-oh
I hate to say I told you so
But you got to go right now

Tell me little dear if you only lived here
Did you really ever live at all
Cause you'd be amazed in the summer how the days
Of the spring turn into fall
Just listen to your brother
You can run in the cover of the night sky when it falls
I know that you think that you're growing
But you're just tall

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The series will be written by comic book veteran Dan Slott and drawn by Sara Pichelli. Marvel’s first family has been in a bit of a hibernation ever since they were split up against the backdrop of the Secret Wars storyline in 2016. Reed and Sue took off with their children to traverse the cosmos while Ben and Johnny remained on Earth. Slott, who is coming off an Amazing Spider-Man run, apparently pitched the folks at Marvel a great story about bringing the team back and they greenlighted it. But does this mean that this Disney/Fox merger is even closer to happening now? Could Disney be encouraging this trial balloon to see how the fans react to it so they can see what interest they have before the merger goes through?

Mark Reilly and John Rocha are here to break down this news for you and offer you their reactions to The Fantastic Four comic book coming back. They also explore if Disney might have had a hand in this behind the scenes and if they would actually be excited to hear about another Fantastic Four movie on the horizon.

kRdECA9JdPQ,woDDGmpV2KE,Lady Gaga SUPPORTS Taylor Swift at Grammys by Wearing Snake Ring?,Clevver News,24.0,2018-01-29 21:03:04+00:00,"['Lady gaga', 'taylor swift', 'Grammys 2018', 'Lady gaga grammys 2018', 'Lady gaga snake ring', 'Grammys 2018 winners', 'Trophy life', 'newsfeed', 'News', 'entertainment', 'clevver news']",111117.0,1795.0,190.0,365.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kRdECA9JdPQ/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

One of the most talked about looks from the 60th Annual Grammy Awards Red carpet last night was rocked by none other than our Mother Monster, Lady Gaga.

Like royalty, Gaga arrived at the carpet in NYC wearing an absolutely stuning Armani Prive jumpsuit, complete with a train fit for a queen, and don’t even get us started on her game of thrones-esque braids. Like I said, QUEEN. 

So, as if we weren’t ALL talking about Lady G already, a little bling on her finger sent the internet into a complete GAGA frenzy. And no, We’re not even talking about the massive diamond on her ring finger. Because lets be real, if there’s anything Hollywood has taught us, it’s that wearing diamond rings that look exactly like engagement rings on your engagement ring finger doesn’t necessarily mean you’re engaged. So no, we’ll let Gaga tell us if and when she’s engaged, and instread we’ll talk about her… Taylor Swift ring?
On one of Gaga’s fingers was a very specific kind of ring that looks terribly familiar. It took about, oh I don’t know, 4 and a half seconds for Swifties to notice Gaga’s bedazzled snake ring that looks a lot like the one Taylor Swift sells on her website. Except Gaga’s had like a thousand diamonds… obviously.
As you probably know, T-Swift totally embraced the role of THE SNAKE after Kim Kardashian used the emoji to represent Taylor when she outed her on Snapchat during that whole Kanye/Taylor/Famous war. Since, Taylor has used snake imagery pretty consistently throughout her latest album, really commiting to taking on the snake persona, so could Gaga’s choice in accessories have been purposeful? 
Fans were quick to speculate about a possible Gaga & Taylor collab, while others think Gaga’s ring was a subtle nod in support of Taylor. And then there are the majority of people who think Gaga just really liked her snake ring and wanted to wear it to The Grammys because she’s a grown adult and can wear whatever she wants to? 

I’m gonna let you guys decide. Why did Gaga wear the snake ring? Share your official decision down in the comments below and then click right here for Gaga’s incredible Grammy’s performance. Thanks so much for tuning in to Clevver, I’m Sinead de Vries, and I’ll see you guys next time.

LYRICS:

this world is sick
my heart feels it
this world is dark
my heart lights up
this world is vice
my heart was iced
this world is blur
my heart stays pure

*heavy breathing*

i don't see 
i don't see
deep inside you
i don't see
(x4)

get down on your knees
this is the last kiss
crawl down to abyss
you have to make this
(x2)

this world is sick
my heart feels it
this world is dark
my heart lights up
this world is vice
my heart was iced
this world is blur
my heart stays pure

This isn't the first instance of a bakery refusing to make a cake for a same sex wedding, there's a case right now in the Supreme Court, but the judge's ruling in this particular case is interesting. He says the bakery would have violated the law if it refused to sell the gay couple a cake that was already baked, but that they can't be forced to bake one. So Jimmy uses a common restaurant dining experience to explain why this isn't right.

This report talks to people on both sides of the conflict. For them Jerusalem is more than a political disagreement. The city is their home, a place of longing for Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. Our documentary joins travel guide Schmuel Kahn, who emigrated from Switzerland to Israel, on a tour through Jerusalem's Old City, where the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam exist side by side. Anthropologist Ali Qleibo, who is descended from an old Palestinian family, wonders how he would react if his daughter wanted to marry a Jewish man. Sarah from Hamburg, who has taken Israeli citizenship, makes a fervent appeal for a Jewish state. And musician Muhammad Mughrabi is convinced that only dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians can bring an 'end of hatred'. This is a report about borders and competing claims to ownership, but also about hope and reconciliation.

Then it's off to the Gleam Christmas party to celebrate the end of the year with some of my favourite people ever and then to the exhibition of our images for the #olympuspenpassionproject phew!

What we throw out goes back into our food supply. Everything runs in a cycle and mindless consumption is corrupting that cycle. This is not just an environmental issue, it's a YOU issue. The average American is expected to throw away 90,000 pounds of trash in their lifetime. 

Cutting down on plastic is imperative to insuring our wildlife and food supply does not become completely wiped out for future generations. The ocean is a big concern for me with our coral dying all over the planet as plastic whirlpools the size of continent are forming, extinguishing entire species and killing countless marine wildlife. If a washed up whale stomaching 64 pounds of plastic they had digested doesn’t make you sick, I really don’t know what else to say. Hopefully those are enough reasons for you to care, now let’s get into the swaps.

From there, she redefined the writer's role in the digital age, crafting powerful works across a variety of mediums, including issue #1 of Lady Deadpool, DJ Khaled's biography The Keys and her new YA book, Emergency Contact.

SUMMARY 
-Albert Einstein said that “Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.” In Math, 2 plus 2 always equals 4. Or does it?
-Be amazed as you see magic happening in front of you. You’ll see how a number picked at random turns into a number previously saved in a secret folder. 
-Pick any five-digit number. You take your secret five-digit number and lose the first digit, then add 2 to the last digit. Now ask one of your friends or even your teacher to give you any number. Next, your task is to name a number, which will give 9999 if you add it to the previous number. Then, again, it is your friends’ turn to pick the four digits.
Once again, you name the next number. Remember it has to give us 9999 in the end.
Now let us put all the numbers together. There you go – we’ve got the number it all started with.

1. No one will ever answer this number, it should always go straight to voicemail, so don't expect that.
2. There's a caller ID. However, I pledge to not do anything with the phone numbers or give them to anyone else. But if that makes you uncomfortable that's fine.
3. Your basic rates and charges for calls, whatever they may be, will still apply.
4. Your voicemail will be recorded and will possibly be used in a video. By calling you agree to allow this.
