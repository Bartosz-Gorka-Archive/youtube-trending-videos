#PRISTIN_V #Like_a_V #네_멋대로 #Get_It #20180528_6PM


지난해 2017년 가장 주목받는 신인 걸그룹으로 떠오르며 각종 시상식에서 신인상을 휩쓴 프리스틴이 데뷔 이후 처음으로 유닛을 결성, 프리스틴 V로서 색다른 매력을 가득 담으며 역대급 유닛 탄생을 알렸다.

프리스틴 V 신규 싱글 앨범 ‘Like a V’는‘ 프리스틴 V’처럼 또는 ‘Villain’처럼 “네 멋대로 해봐”라는 의미를 담았다.
타이틀곡 ‘네 멋대로’는 원하는 것을 망설임 없이 얻어내는 자유분방함과 솔직함을 담아낸 메시지가 인상적인 곡으로, 기존에 프리스틴이 시도하지 않았던 래칫 기반의 R&B 팝 장르를 첫 선보이며, 프리스틴 V만의 색다른 분위기와 퍼포먼스를 기대할 수 있는 곡이다.


PRISTIN V's new single album 'Like a V' delivers a message of ""Do as you please"" like PRISTIN V or Villain.

The title 'Get It' is an impressive song expressing free-spirits and honesty earned without hesitation. Ratchet based R&B pop genre is something they have not tried before, so you can definitely look forward to catching the ambiance and the performance from PRISTIN V only.

The world has come to know of the infamous bullet ants native to South America due to their intense and painful stings which allegedly feel like a bullet once stung. However, in Asia, there is an equivalent ant species that I feel blows bullet ants out of the water with respect to uniqueness, ferocity, intelligence, and over all cool factor! Check out my new ant colony to join my collection of fire ants, black crazy ants, yellow crazy ants, and Polyrhachis ants. These ants are queenless, but that's just scraping the surface of their uniqueness!

Imagine this: A sudden bright light followed by the sounds of the heavens opening. An intense heat blast smashes through the city and a gigantic mushroom cloud slowly rises. Cars swerve from the roads amid the screams of fear, panic, and pain. And that’s only if you have enough time to see the spectacle, before being blasted off the face of the earth. It’s an apocalyptic image alright, but would a nuclear blast really spell the end of the world? Are there any steps that we could take in advance to avoid frying as the nuclear device is detonated in our home city? That’s what we’ll find out, in this episode of The Infographics Show, How to Survive Nuclear Fallout.

Travis from iwonder TV meet up with Tim Friede to his is unbelievable immunity to venomous snakes. Wisconsin resident and snake enthusiast Tim Friede allows himself to be bitten four times by the deadly black mamba snake. Snakes attack many people each year causing uncertain loss of life but how does Tim survive a bite that often kills victims within 20 minutes?  For the past 16 years, Tim Friede has been boosted over 700 times with snake venom, including over 200 snake bites from live venomous snakes. Over the course of these boosts, he has developed a remarkable immunity to snakes that would be ordinarily lethal, including cobras, taipans, black mambas, diamondback rattlers, and many others. He is resistant to a genetically diverse panel of snakes spanning the Americas, Asia, Australia, Africa and Europe, indicating that he has affinity matured broadly neutralizing antibodies that can recognize and neutralize all snake venoms. Backed by Jacob Glanville who is a world expert in in high-throughput sequencing and antibody display bioengineering technologies capable of rapidly recovering the genetic instructions for antibodies developed from live immunizations. Research on his blood have identified extremely elevated IgG4 anti-sera against snake venoms and a generally elevated IgG. Tim's blood contains the instructions for a universal, fully human anti venom to help make a vaccine.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

[Bridge]
Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, oh)
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
(Living for your every move)
Oh my, my, my

It's a fairly modern night market with lots of fusion dishes as well as some traditional Filipino eats.

What I LOVED the most here at this night market in Cebu Philippines is my first stop of the night, at an all natural roast chicken food booth that has the most delicious roast chicken and chicken soup! The chicken soup more than anything made my taste buds sing!

This is my first stop in Cebu and can't wait to eat more!

Today I get to talk about two of my favourite books: 1984 and Brave New World. Together, these novels paint a full picture of how human beings are susceptible to the tactics of totalitarian regimes. They also show how art is a vital protection against any system of control, as it enhances a society's ability to empathize.

""President Trump said he would dramatically reduce the size of a vast expanse of protected federal land in Utah on Monday, a rollback of some two million acres that is the largest in scale in the nation’s history.

The administration said it would shrink Bears Ears National Monument, a sprawling region of red rock canyons, by about 85 percent, and cut another area, Grand Staircase-Escalante, to about half its current size. The move, a reversal of protections put in place by Democratic predecessors, comes as the administration pushes for fewer restrictions and more development on public lands.

The decision to reduce Bears Ears is expected to trigger a legal battle that could alter the course of American land conservation, possibly opening millions of protected public acres to oil and gas extraction, mining, logging and other commercial activities.

“Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,” Mr. Trump said, speaking at Utah’s domed State Capitol. “And guess what? They’re wrong.””*

NEW DINOSAUR SPECIES CONFIRMED?! | Jurassic World: Evolution News

ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD: EVOLUTION
A brand new Jurassic World video game - Jurassic World: Evolution has been announced. Coming in Summer 2018 this park builder for PC, Xbox One and PS4 is going to let us finally build our very own Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World film, Jurassic World Evolution will contain a bunch of dinosaurs including the Tyrannosaurus Rex Rexy, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Indominus Rex, Indoraptor (okay probably) and more. Jurassic World Evolution will release alongside Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and is the top upcoming dinosaur game for 2018.

No swearing, family friendly commentary.

Gordon Ramsay is well known for his countless wide array of insults that he constantly hurls at contestants and people on his various shows such as Hell’s Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares. For your entertainment, we here at Babble Top have gathered them all and put together a list of Gordon Ramsay’sTop 10 Gordon Ramsay’s BEST Insults! Enjoy the list! Gordon Ramsay is a well-known star chef around the world not only for his cooking but also for his sharp tongue and hilarious comebacks. His restaurants have been awarded a grand total of 16 Michelin stars, and he’s also one of the biggest and highest paid stars on television. According to Forbes, Ramsay made $60 million in 2015 alone. They rank Gordon as the 21st highest-earning celebrity in the world. But what exactly is it that makes Gordon Ramsay so popular? Here’s a hint: it’s not just his cooking! It’s also his angry, expletive-ridden insults against budding chefs. This may sound awful, but that’s what sells: people love it! TV Guide included Gordon Ramsay on their list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time, but they meant it in a good way. He’s a likable villain, and his rants are highly entertaining. He tends to get very creative with his invectives. We have already compiled a list of his greatest insults back in 2017, with the title ""Gordon Ramsay’s BEST Insults!"" So for this year are happy to show you the Top 10 Gordon Ramsay’s BEST Insults ...towards customers! as of 2018.

What is more entertaining than when Gordon Ramsay yells at a scared customer who just stands there speechless, arguing with an awkward customer, or witnessing the best of Hell's Kitchen Customer Fumbles? While it's great to see him tell off chefs, it's even better to watch him tell off customers!

4QgrKBeeChU,CO9dIyNM_9Q,NTSB report details dangerous maneuvers by Roy Halladay before deadly crash,latest sports news usa,22.0,2017-11-21 12:00:13+00:00,"['roy halladay', 'mlb', 'halladay crash', 'halladay flight', 'baseball', 'philadelphia phillies', 'toronto blue jays']",7190.0,8.0,18.0,5.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QgrKBeeChU/default.jpg,"Roy Halladay skimmed the Gulf of Mexico and flew his aircraft within 75 feet of beach-adjacent homes before his crash earlier this month, according to a preliminary report released Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board. The agency did not provide a specific cause of the fatal incident that occurred earlier this month, but it used data retrieved from the former pitcher’s plane to detail his 17-minute flight.

Halladay was the only person aboard his two-seat ICON A5, an amphibious plane with folding wings designed to serve as a recreational vehicle, when it plunged into the Gulf near Tampa on Nov. 7. The two-time Cy Young Award winner, who was 40, was found with his plane, which was upside down in about 4.5 feet of water.

[Boston radio host apologizes for ‘low-class, bad, not good’ rant about Roy Halladay’s death]

NTSB investigators said in their report that Halladay took off from a lake near his home in Odessa, Fla., located north of Tampa, and climbed to just over 1900 feet before descending as he neared the coastline. When Halladay crossed over U.S. Route 19, a highway that runs along Florida’s West coast before ending on the south side of Tampa Bay, he was at about 600 feet.
When Halladay reached water, he was only 36 feet in the air, and he subsequently skimmed the surface at 11 feet while traveling at about 105 mph. He then passed close to the homes, and his last recorded altitude was about 200 feet.

A witness told the NTSB that he saw the plane climb to between 300 and 500 feet before turning and going into a dive at about a 45-degree angle. TMZ Sports published video of a plane reported to be Halladay’s flying very low over the Gulf, and witnesses told the website that the aircraft was repeatedly making sharp ascents and descents to within a few feet of the water.

The former Blue Jays and Phillies ace, who retired in 2013, logged about 700 hours of flight time starting in that year, according to the report. He had 51 hours in A5 planes, including 14 in the one that crashed, which he acquired in October.

Halladay shared his excitement about his new plane on social media. “Real life is better than my dreams!!” he said in one post.
“Sadly, this looks like a typical case of pilot hot-dogging,” Ross Aimer, a 33,000-hour pilot who heads an aviation consulting firm, told the Tampa Bay Times. Aimer noted that Halladay “came way too close” to the beach-adjacent properties and could have been subject to punishment from the Federal Aviation Administration.
The NTSB has yet to determine to what degree the crash was caused by Halladay’s maneuvers, or if there were technical or structural malfunctions. The man who led the design of the A5 died while flying one in California, and the agency cited pilot error as the cause in that case.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QgrKBeeChU/sddefault.jpg,0.0011126564673157164,0.0025034770514603608,0.4444444444444444,0.0006954102920723226,0.0036161335187760773,0.004311543810848401,2017-11-21,12:00:13,Tuesday,1,11,13,11,12,75,118,0,22,1,0,2,0,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.764933053956058,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'airplane': 1, 'person': 2}",3

We believe that the world is a wonderfully fascinating place, and you can find wonder anywhere you look. That is what our videos attempt to convey.

Currently, I try my best to release one video every week. Bear with me :)

The ""R34"" Nissan Skyline GT-R is one of the ultimate Japanese cars -- and it's the most desirable Nissan model ever built. My entire life, I've dreamt of driving the R34 Skyline GT-R -- and today I'm reviewing this R34 GT-R, which is one of a handful of R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R models legally in the United States.

[verse 1]
i don't have a lot to say
you know just how to annoy me
but i need you everyday
i still need you everyday
i know i could be just friend
out on my own every friday
but you're my funny valentine
you're my funny valentine

[pre-chorus]
i am changing

[chorus]
i don't wanna leave you occupy my mind
it's crazier each time
i don't wanna be without you
how did you know it?
standing next to me
the sun can lose its shine
we carry on just fine
i don't wanna live without you
how did you know it?

[post-chorus]
how did you know it?
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
how did you know it?


[verse 2]
your silence is deafening
wish we could stick to the story
i need you and you need me
we're in perfect symmetry
you know i could be just fine
fly on the wall at the party
no one wants to be lonely
love is not the enemy

[pre-chorus]
i am changing

[chorus 2]
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave you occupy my mind
it's crazier each time
i don't wanna be without you
how did you know it?
standing next to me
the sun can lose its shine
we carry on just fine
i don't wanna live without you
how did you know it?

[post-chorus]
how did you know it?
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
i don't wanna leave, i don't wanna leave, i don't
how did you know it?


[outro]
i don't wanna leave you occupy my mind
it's crazier each time
i don't wanna be without you
how did you know it?
standing next to me
the sun can lose its shine
we carry on just fine
i don't wanna live without you
how did you know it?

Its soundtrack is a mix of 80s pop, classical compositions & songs by singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, including two songs written specifically for the film.

Listen to the full soundtrack: https://soundtracks.lnk.to/CallMeByYourName

While the soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a compilation of tracks by numerous musicians, Guadagnino decided he wanted to approach American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens to create a song especially for the film. “An artist for whom I have enormous admiration is Sufjan. His voice is fantastic and angelic, and his lyrics are so sharp and deep and full of sorrow and beauty. The music is so haunting. All these elements were the ones I wanted to envision in the film.”

While Guadagnino knew that Stevens had never collaborated on a movie before, he reached out. Stevens read the book, they had a long conversation, and the result was that he wrote not one, but two original songs for the film: “Mystery of Love” and “Visions of Gideon”.

The soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME also includes tracks by John Adams and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as pieces written by Erik Satie, Maurice Ravel and Johann Sebastian Bach. As the film is set in the 1980s, Guadagnino chose period Italian pop music (including Giorgio Moroder & Joe Esposito’s “Lady Lady Lady”) for the radio, but particularly spotlights The Psychedelic Furs’ anthem “Love My Way”. “I love The Psychedelic Furs,” says Guadagnino. “It’s kind of autobiographical, because I remember listening to that song when I was seventeen and being completely affected by it. I wanted to pay homage to myself then.”

LYRICS
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
'Til I breathe my last breath
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

This is a sequel to my other video on the food environment in Japan titled ""Why is it so easy to be thin in Japan?""
Having lived in America and now living in Japan, it's interesting to see how very different these two food environments are. I've seen comments on another one of my videos about low carb saying something like ""Oh sure, you can lose weight on low carb, which is why all the rice eating Japanese people are so thin, right?"" 
So with this video (and maybe the last one), I'm hoping to show that the diet over here is more complex than just ""high carb""


0:00 - Intro: America & Japan
0:42 - People walk more in Japan
1:35 - Portion sizes are smaller 
2:30 - America and Soda
2:40 - Rice vs. Wheat
3:50 - Fermented foods keeping the gut healthy
5:14 - Meat consumption is balanced with Fish consumption
5:54 - Muscle meat and organ meat balance
7:57 - Green Tea
8:43 - School Lunches in Japan

It cost about as much as the competition, but lacked essential features like multitasking and 3G that had come to define the smartphone. But the iPhone succeeded partly because it was willing to re-define what it meant to be a smartphone. The analogy to Google’s Pixelbook is imperfect –this is not the first Chromebook, nor is the laptop market as ripe for a shakeup as was the smartphone world of 2007– but the Pixelbook does strike me as the notebook of the future in the same way the iPhone proved to be the phone of the future. That makes the Pixelbook very compelling, despite its high price point. I’m MrMobile and my second-ever Chromebook video is a doozy: join me for the Google Pixelbook Review!

No one has been killed or seriously wounded so far and authorities say that is largely due to residents' preparedness and an effective evacuation plan.

But past eruptions on the Big Island have led to mass casualties and even affected the global climate.

Curiosity.com Article:  https://curiosity.com/topics/watch-people-swim-in-this-bubbling-liquid-sand-pool-curiosity

Science Team! This was by far the biggest project this channel has ever taken on. It was almost a month of planning, building, filming and editing!!! The end result was a MASSIVE LIQUID SAND POOL! 

This particular science phenomenon takes advantage of what is called a “fluidized bed”. These are mostly used in industrial applications the process combines a pressurized fluid (a liquid or a gas) and forces into a solid like sand or dust. This combination makes these solid particles act like a fluid. 

The feeling of falling back into dry sand that acts like a liquid is very strange and in some ways very relaxing.  The sensation is somewhat like what you think floating in Jello would feel like, however, because it’s totally dry you feel super comfortable! 

This particular video was made so much more fun because of the SMOSH squad, Jordan of “Captain Sparklez” and the Pocket.Watch team (of which has the best clip in the video face planting into the sand pool). The Pocket Watch team, in particular, made this possible with helping me fund the entire project, so big thank you and make sure to take a look at their channel for some footage not seen in this video! 

Also, big shout out to Mark Rober for coming up with this original liquid sand concept. His video is here:  https://youtu.be/My4RA5I0FKs

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Not completely piano tune but definitely dominated by piano. It was a Saturday night gig at a hotel lobby and I was entertaining my biggest crowd of the week. This was my second song of the night and I asked them if there is anything specific they wanted to hear. One gentleman decided to be funny and asked me if I know any piano tunes. Clearly my entire one man band set up is based around guitar and piano request sounded like really good joke but I decided to give it try anyways. After searching for a quick inspiration I came up with what you see and hear in the video.

There are 2 spots and 2 floods on the mounting brackets. Mounting them was pretty easy, just a few bolts and they are in. Then it just deciding where you want to aim the lights. I ended up aiming them more out to the sides since I also have the 32"" hidden in the bumper. This seemed to provided a greater side shot in addition to the 32"" spot/flood combo. I am pretty happy with how bright the pods are, the spots are not quite as focused as I would have liked, but for the price, they are perfect.

In the eighties, when Arnold Schwarzenegger uttered his immortal “I'll be back,” we could hardly imagine how his image would be transformed in the twenty-first century. Judging by the fact that all the assumed dates of the machine's rebellion in “Terminator” have already passed (1997, 2004 and 2011), the destruction of the human race will probably be postponed.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

As popular as superhero movies are these days, it's definitely fair to say that the characters in them are very rarely completely faithful depictions of the versions presented in comic books. They often look completely different, have different origins, possess different powers, or have different personalities - in some cases, all four of those differences apply.
Believe it or not, this notion even applies in the incredibly popular Marvel Cinematic Universe - including in the case of the franchise's heroic characters.
In this video, we'll be taking a closer look at that particular idea. The following MCU heroes were completely changed for their respective movies; The franchise's flagship character Tony Stark AKA Iron Man who's played by Robert Downey Jr., the Guardians of the Galaxy's leader Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord who's played by Chris Pratt, the powerful android Vision who's played by Paul Bettany, the Guardians of the Galaxy's muscle Drax the Destroyer who's played by Dave Bautista, former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and scientist Hank Pym AKA the first Ant-Man who's played by Michael Douglas, the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff AKA Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver who are played by Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson respectively, the incredibly skilled archer Clint Barton AKA Hawkeye who's played by Jeremy Renner, the perfectly designed being Adam Warlock who hasn't yet been cast, the Asgardian warrior Valkyrie who's played by Tessa Thompson, and the hilarious rock-like warrior Korg who's played by Taika Waititi.
We hope you enjoy the video! Make sure you subscribe to our channel and let us know in the comments what you think!

ALONE IN A ROOM // LYRICS:

I've been away, a little while
sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind’s running wild,
I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do,
but it's no use

I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me I tried, in the end I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me, me

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream

A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head against the wall tryna put words on a page

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room, alone in a room

I saw the world a couple times,
tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playing tricks on me
Feeling older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn, but I'm starting to learn

Sometimes I'll fall down
sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me, me

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream

A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head against the wall tryna put words on a page

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room, alone in a room

I can be better than I was
I can be better than I am

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream

A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head against the wall tryna put words on a page

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room, alone in a room

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Having been born in Petah Tikva on the 30th of April in 1985, Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot has gone on to become one of the hottest properties in Hollywood today.
The gorgeous star first came to the attention of movie fans with her role as Gisele Yashar in the Fast and Furious franchise, but she truly rose to mega-stardom when she was cast as the iconic superheroine Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe - a role in which she has truly thrived and has rightfully received a lot of praise for.
Gadot already comes across as an extremely likeable person, but the 25 quick facts in this video will make you like her even more!
The facts include her ordinary early life which included babysitting jobs and working at Burger King, the fact that she won the Miss Israel pageant, the fact that she subsequently sabotaged her own chance at winning the Miss Universe pageant, the fact that she's an amazing mother who also loves her family dog, the fact that she's a total bad-ass who served in the Israeli armed forces and loves motorcycles, the fact that internet data suggests she's the most loved Israeli on the planet, and the fact that she's the least discriminative person you could ever wish to meet!
We hope you enjoy the video! Let us know exactly what you thought of it in the comments section. And please don't forget to subscribe to Screen Rant's YouTube channel so you never miss our great new video uploads in the future.

Talad Rot Fai Ratchada (ตลาดรถไฟรัชดา) - Also known as the train market, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok. It’s especially popular on the weekend when a younger crowd flocks to the market to eat the latest Thai street food trends, and hang out with friends.

The train market has in recent months become famous for its giant food - you’ll find a number of giant Thai dishes to try like egg noodles, pork bone soup, and now the massive lobster tom yum - possibly the world’s biggest bowl of tom yum?

Diaw Goong Rot Fai Restaurant (เตี๋ยวกุ้งรถไฟ) - This is the name of the restaurant, and when we ordered they started preparing the lobster.

Giant Lobster Tom Yum (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำโครตกุ้งมังกรยักษ์) - They serve it in a basin, like a mini bathtub, not even a bowl. And it’s HUGE. They layer in the fish, squid, mussels, shrimp, and finally a giant lobster goes on top, followed by all the tom yum soup broth. Honestly, the seafood isn’t the freshest or best quality, but you don’t really go to eat a bathtub of seafood for the quality - you go for the insaneness of it.
Price - 2,800 THB ($89.27)

Here are the other Thai street foods we tried on this tour:

Seafood griddle cakes (ขนมครกทะเล)
Price - 60 THB ($1.91)

Green mango crab egg salad (ยำมะม่วงไข่ปูทะเล)
Price - 150 THB ($4.78)

Watermelon shake (แตงโมปั่น)
Price - 60 THB ($1.91)

Thanks again to Ramon for joining me on this Thai street food lobster tom yum food challenge! Again, check out Ramon: https://bit.ly/2K5SBvi

In this video I discuss why I chose the DJI Spark over the Mavic Air and why I think it is a better drone for most people's needs.  

I discuss all the differences between the two drones: 4K video vs 1080 HD, 3 axis vs 2 axis gimbal, RAW vs Jpeg and image quality, size and portability and even some of the advantages the Spark has over the Mavic Air such as USB charging.

I mean I work in Japan, but I work from my home and have never needed Japanese language or workplace skills. But I do know people who have, so I set up interviews with 8 of them to see what their experiences were like. All of them worked in the ""real"" Japanese workplace, from small, modern companies to big traditional ones. Or in other words, they worked jobs that didn't involve teaching English. They needed to be proficient in the Japanese language and business culture. All the interviewees speak English, have lived outside of Japan for some period of time, and have university degrees. So these are not your typical Japanese workers, let's just be ultra clear on that. But I think they do help give insight into what it's like working in Japan and how it compares to working in a global or Western workplace.

This is the short version of the interviews. For the hour long version please check it out at https://youtu.be/qrWkgVu2MHo

**CORRECTION: It's illegal to not pay overtime, even for full-time employees. There can be some exceptions for management. So I was wrong in saying that full-time employees don't typically get paid overtime. Sorry for the screw up. 

Special thanks to all those that all the interviewees that let me barrage them with questions.

You know I like Jordan Matter and his 10 minute photo challenge. I’ve also been seeing these IG recreation videos on YouTube lately, where someone like Sydney Serena copies Annie Leblanc's Instagram photos for a week and decided to give it a try! Maddie Ziegler and Makenzie Ziegler are very good at this, too!

Normally when someone is recreating another youtuber or celebrity’s Instagram photos, they don’t have access to that person’s closet and wardrobe...but with Brooklyn and Bailey, all I have to do is walk downstairs into their room! How could I not recreate Brooklyn and Bailey ’s photos when I have access to everything I need already? I also know where the pictures were taken, because I TOOK MOST OF THEM!

It’s crazy to see my photos next to theirs, because we really do look like triplets instead of twins! We get that a lot from people. Recreating BrooklynAndBailey's IG feed was really fun! 

YOU GUYS... our HAIR SCRUNCHIES are BACK IN STOCK! Plus, we released a NEW set of colors... White, Denim, and Purple! You can find our Scrunchies HERE!  ▶ https://brooklynandbaileyshop.com 

One thing I cannot figure out how to copy is how does Brooklyn get her eyes to open so wide? She seriously has like doe eyes! My favorite photo to recreate was the creek photo, because it took me on quite the adventure in our back yard! I had to cross a creek with rushing water in order to get to the right spot!

This is such a fun and creative activity! I could be fun for friends to do over the summer break with each others' instagrams or their favorite celebrity’s Instagram!

Song used: ""Wait for Me"" from Hadestown the Musical. 
All song, story, and character rights go to Anais Mitchell, Ghostlight Records and affiliates. 

Even if you haven't seen the musical and have no idea what's happening, hope you enjoy. We can all laugh at Orpheus losing his sanity and my total disregard for continuity. :')

**EDIT**
It has come to my attention that many people are confused as to this is about. Let me just clear things up a wee bit. 
The guy at the beginning with the hair curl is Orpheus. 
The man with the hat is Hermes. 
The girl in the ending is Eurydice. 
This musical is based off the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and this song is Hermes telling Orpheus how he can get into Hadestown (a.k.a. the underworld) to retrieve his wife (Eurydice) from there. I don't want to give too much away, so there's the bare bones of what you need to know.

Unrelated note
Apologies that this isn't the Pitiful Children animatic like how I let on. By the time I started work on the Pitiful Children, my infatuation with Be More Chill was dying and I no longer had the drive to finish it. Maybe I'll release the remnants one day. 

And, some of you may have noticed, but since about a month ago, my ""Squip Song"" animatic is no longer on my channel. Unfortunately, it got copyright striked by Two River Theatre themselves (kind of a honor? kind of disappointing?) and the video got removed. However, I plan to privately message them to ask them to retract their claim in the name of fan appreciation. Even so, if they don't do anything, I'll reupload the original. It'll be back on the channel soon either way.

Goodbye, and see you in another 6 months.

OK, this video has taken me the longest time to do, because I really didn't feel comfortable with creating a video that I felt might encourage people to just fill their homes with animals. Please don't do that. I have a very unique lifestyle and work life which completely revolve around my animals. They're not just my companions, family and pets, they're my whole career.
My fiance is a zoologist and his whole life and job revolves around these animals too. They're not a hobby to us or commodities to show off on YouTube.

In this ALL MY PETS video, I will be introducing you to the official Emzotic channel animals. These are all of my pets which you'll be seeing every setup, diet video and routine video about.  I may add other animals into the mix, through creature features and other types of videos, but these are the animals I'd like to focus on in depth.

Thank you all for being patient with me while I decided how to approach this video. I just don't want to be a bad influence on the PetTube community.

I love you all!

USB seems so common place now, it's sometimes hard to imagine what we used before it? Well, thanks to a multitude of connections such as RS-232 (Serial), Centronics Parellel and the splendid Gameport, we were able to use many a device without issue.... maybe.

Boxes with lids, like the IKEA KVARNVIK boxes, keep the top of your dresser clutter-free and stylish.

This video is sponsored by eBay : http://from.ebay.co.uk/Avengers

Make sure you check out the two videos that went up before this one if you’re interested in how to build a real Hulkbuster we made from steel. This took some serious building to get the whole thing up and running all with parts bought from eBay.

In the end, it was all worth it to have a Hulkbuster that can smash all the things. It’s a shame I can’t take it everywhere I go, would be useful carrying all the shopping in from the car, or reaching the very top shelf. If you can think of any other every day uses I’d love to see them in the comments.

The Titanic was a massive cruise ship that was commonly viewed as indestructible. When it began its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City in 1912, voyagers indulged in some of the most elegant luxuries of the time. But the state-of-the-art safety equipment wasn’t enough to keep the ship afloat after striking a massive iceberg; more than 1,500 people died. Now the infamous ship rests 12,000 feet deep in the Atlantic Ocean, about 400 miles southeast of Newfoundland. This video will reveal some little-known facts from this iconic story that intrigues historians to this day.

For broadcasting: sales@romereports.com 

ROME REPORTS, www.romereports.com, is an independent international TV News Agency based in Rome covering the activity of the Pope, the life of the Vatican and current social, cultural and religious debates. Reporting on the Catholic Church requires proximity to the source, in-depth knowledge of the Institution, and a high standard of creativity and technical excellence.

Shima Steak (西洋料理 島) is a well, one of the must-eat wagyu beef steak restaurants in Tokyo, and it was an honor to be able to have a chance to eat there for lunch one day on this Tokyo food tour. You could either order the sirloin or the fillet, and I decided to go for the sirloin, because it’s known to be a little fatter and juicier.

The chef at Shima Steak (西洋料理 島) has developed his own unique grill for steak, where it’s a wood fire oven, but it grills and bakes at the same time. He cuts hugely thick slices of wagyu beef steak and then skewers them to cook in the oven grill.

It was one of the most tender, juicy, and insanely flavorful steaks I’ve ever had. And not only the food, but I really enjoyed the friendliness of the restaurant, the chef and his wife, and  how it really felt like you were going over to your relatives or grandparents house to eat a top of the line  Japanese beef wagyu steak.

Thanks for Khun Mangmoom (https://www.instagram.com/yingmangmoomofficial/) for letting me try the wagyu fillet!

For dessert, one of the things you can’t miss when you eat at Shima Steak is their world famous steak sandwich. You have to watch the full video to see  how it’s made, but all I can say is that it will amaze you how much beef they stack into the sandwich and how they pack it into a to go box bento style. It’s mind blowing, and insanely delicious!

Price - about 12,000 JPY ($106.94) per steak

Thank you to The Hungry Tourist for inviting me on The Best of Tokyo Food Tour. I didn’t personally pay for the food in this video.

After the success of previous releases, including the wildly fruitful melodies and raw vocals of ‘Crazy’, Lost Frequencies now announces ‘Melody’ featuring chart-topping singer-songwriter James Blunt, with an uplifting video to match.

Taking adolescent troubles and hardship wrapped up with with love, excitement and music as both a release, and a tool for confidence and visibility , the video for ‘Melody’ was filmed at Lost Frequencies’s own boarding school he attended in his formative teenage years, giving an injection of relatability, hope and positivity for a visual that perfectly missors the hopeful, empassioned lyrics.

On the track, Lost Frequencies pays homage to country sounds using melodic guitar strums and by twisting Blunt’s soaring vocal into a unique loop come the chorus, which flows around the rhythm like a waterfall.  The release came about after Blunt had been writing in the studio with Steve Mac (co-writer and co-producer on Ed Sheeran's ‘Shape Of You’) and Ammar Malik (co-writer of Maroon 5's ‘Moves Like Jagger’) on a song called ‘Hey, Melody.’, that Lost Frequencies then added his studio spin on for a unique release.

One such pattern is a four-year temperature cycle in the Jovian upper atmosphere called the QQO.

This cycle has a little sibling in Earth's stratosphere that can influence the transport of aerosols and the formation of hurricanes, making it an active area of climate research. Now, scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have developed a new model for understanding Jupiter's QQO, and it could lead to a better climate model for Earth.

The biggest superhero team-up of all time — for now — has finally dropped. Avengers: Infinity War is the payoff of ten years of storytelling done over the course of nearly 20 films. The movie follows the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and a smattering of other superheroes as they take on the Mad Titan, Thanos, who seeks to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet with the intent of wiping out half of all life in existence. That obviously doesn't bode well for, uh, existence — so heroes from all across the Marvel Cinematic Universe have to step up and do everything they can to stop him. The film is a funny, action-packed, and ultimately bittersweet romp that somehow pulls off the ambitious balancing act it sets out to accomplish. By the time it ends, our heroes and the universe they inhabit have been forever changed. It isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn near close. Obviously, watch out for some heavy duty spoilers, because we're going to ruin this movie's plot twists like Thanos ruined — well, you'll see. These are the five best and five worst things about Avengers: Infinity War...

Best: Hulk meets his match | 0:57
Worst: A bad perspective | 2:06
Best: The brightest light | 3:07
Worst: A fatal fit of mischief | 4:01
Best: Anti-hero | 4:39
Worst: They'll be back | 5:22
Best: Let it breathe | 6:28
Worst: Cap it off | 7:18
Best: Sticking the landing | 8:05
Worst: Accent amnesia | 9:04

In this conclusion of my Archetype Series based on the book King, Warrior, Magician, Lover by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette, I examine the archetype of the Magician and explore some related concepts such as initiation, ritual process and sacred space.

About INCREDIBLES 2: 
In “Incredibles 2,” Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack—whose superpowers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don’t shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That’s what makes this family so Incredible. 

Written and directed by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles,” “Ratatouille”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles,” “Tomorrowland”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), Disney•Pixar’s “Incredibles 2” busts into cinemas on July 13, 2018.

Get ready to sing and dance, laugh and love all over again.

Ten years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA. With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film. Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical. 

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker. Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers. Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.

Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna. Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful). Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).

LYRICS:
Last night put the heavy on me
Woke up, and I’m feeling lonely
This world gotta a way of showin’ me
Some days it’ll lift you up
Some days it’ll call your bluff
Man, most of my days I ain’t got enough

And all I know is You’re my only hope

When I’m up, when I’m down
When the wolves come around
When my feet hit the ground
I just need, I just need U
On my darkest days, when I’m losing faith
No, it ain’t gonna change
I just need, I just need U
Lord, I need U
Yeah, I just need U

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff …
They comfort me when I’m beat down broken
Hold my heart when it’s split wide-open
Turn these eyes to my sole protector
And break the will of this born defector

When You pull me closer I come to life

Ain’t no way this thing gon’ change, it’s U
I need on my darkest days, when I’m losing faith
I need U every single day, every breath I take
I need U

“Zombies” was Disney’s 2018 DCOM hit, however, there are some dark secrets from the film you don’t know about. When the film was released we all fell in love with Meg Donnelly and Milo Manheim playing the lead roles of Addison and Zed. But is their onscreen romance turning into an offscreen chemistry? Or are the two just friends? What was all the drama with the hair department...you won’t believe the colors and wigs they went through before actually dying someone’s hair green! Trevor Tordjman who plays the evil cheerleader Bucky has a personality that has been kept a secret. And James Godfrey, the cool dude playing the zombie Bonzo knows something you don’t. Did Dove Cameron really tweet back at “Zombies”?

Watch this video as we reveal all the shocking secrets from “Zombies”. You won’t even believe what they did to get the musical number BAMM to be as incredible as it is, not too mention the first director that was let go...

TARJA RELEASES WINTER ALBUM “FROM SPIRITS AND GHOSTS (SCORE FOR A DARK CHRISTMAS)” ON NOVEMBER 17, 2017 ON earMUSIC. INCLUDING BRAND NEW ORIGINAL SONG “TOGETHER”.

This year, Tarja is bringing the festive season early with the release of her brand new Christmas album “from Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a dark Christmas)” on November 17. This Christmas you can expect the unexpected.

The album includes 11 Christmas classics and brings them to a never before seen level, uniquely blending Tarja’s classically trained voice with darker gothic influences. Utilizing the sound of a grand orchestra, the most successful Finnish solo artist puts a sinister spin on traditional songs like “O Tannenbaum”, “We Wish You A Merry Christmas” and “Feliz Navidad”, reminding the listener of a dark movie score. Besides covering classic carols, “from Spirits and Ghosts” also features a 12th track, the brand new original “Together”. This song is aligned with the dark sound of the album and embodies the theme of ghosts and mysticism throughout, in a brilliant, Tarja-styled manner.

Says Tarja: “Producing a dark Christmas album in the middle of the summer is a very interesting process, especially if you are doing it by the turquoise Caribbean Sea. Significantly different from the snowy Christmas that I am used to in my home country Finland. Another proof that the darkness comes from deep within. On this album, I explored the other side of Christmas. The Christmas of the lonely people and the missing ones. The Christmas for those that do not find joy in the blinking lights and the jingle bells. ”  

“from Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a dark Christmas)” is going to be released on November 17th, 2017 on earMUSIC as 1CD digipak, 1LP Gatefold (180g, black) and Digital.
The “Official Store for a dark Christmas” offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles.

The album is produced by Tarja, the American Emmy Award winning film score composer Jim Dooley and British producer Tim Palmer, known for his work with Pearl Jam, U2, David Bowie, Lang Lang and The Cure among others, who also mixed the album at 62’ Studio in Texas. The album was mastered at Sterling Sound in NY City.

This Christmas, gather your loved ones, dim the lights, put on some candles and play Tarja’s “from Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a dark Christmas)” loud!

Because the resort grounds are so expansive we decided that the best way to tour the entire resort was by cart. We explored all of the pool locations, comfort stations and food outposts. There are so many great food locations at this resort! Hoop-Dee-Doo Revue, Trails End, P&J's Southern Takeout, and Crockett's. We ate at P&J's Southern takeout and it wasn't bad! The ribs were pretty good. We also checked out the RV campgrounds and the tent camping spots. It looked pretty nice and we'll definitely be camping here in the future! We to Tri Circle D Ranch and saw all the horses and ponies, one of the coolest parts of the resort!

The writer-director answers questions for 70 minutes!

While Collider has hosted a number of cool screenings over the past few years, the one we did last week at IMAX HQ might be the top of the list. That’s because after showing Star Wars: The Last Jedi in IMAX, I got to sit down with writer-director Rian Johnson for an almost 70-minute interview where he spoke in-depth about the making of the movie. Not only did he discuss everything from the writing process to deleted scenes, he also answered a number of questions from the fans in attendance, like where he got the inspiration for Rose’s necklace and why Captain Phasma ""got the Boba Fett treatment.""

As a lifelong Star Wars fan, getting to ask Rian Johnson questions about how The Last Jedi was made was something I’ll never forget and the words “thank you” don’t fully express how special the night was for all that attended the event. Not only did Rian Johnson do the extended Q&A, but after that ended he surprised the audience by taking pictures and signing autographs with everyone that attended the screening! Trust me, that is not the norm and just another reason why everyone left the event on cloud nine.

With so many people asking for tickets for the screening/Q&A (we had over 1,500 people ask for tickets), we knew this was one of those special nights we needed to have cameras rolling. So if you weren’t there and have been wondering what Rian Johnson talked about, check out the player above where you can see the full Q&A!

Finally, I’d like to give a big thank you to IMAX for being such an awesome screening partner and to Rian Johnson for literally spending hours talking with me and the fans.

And considering the numbers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the hardcore Star Wars fans (mostly nerdy men) simply are not buying it. Numbers don't lie my friends. I predict that Episode 9 will be the next Batman v Superman, and will actually LOSE money for Disney.

Он их хватает, запирает в кабинете, предлагает  «стать его любовницей». Ситуация кажется совершенно дикой, такое невозможно, но факт в том, что депутат Государственной думы Леонид Слуцкий продолжает оставаться депутатом, несмотря на то, что уже несколько журналисток заявили о сексуальных домогательствах с его стороны. А одна даже записала их на диктофон. А руководители Государственной Думы советуют девушкам «найти новую работу», если обстановка в Думе их не устраивает. 
Сегодня 8 марта. Замечательный праздник солидарности с женщинами, отстаивающими равноправие. Фонд борьбы с коррупцией выражает поддержку смелым журналисткам, не побоявшимся рассказать правду о депутате Слуцком, и публикует факты, на основании которых депутат должен быть немедленно лишен мандата. Он не только похотливй извращенец, но и коррупционер. 
С праздником! С международным женским днем.

On January 22nd, Alex and I were in New York City to help Team USA and Ralph Lauren unveil the Opening Ceremony Uniform.
For ALL of our competitions and a majority of our other events, I do my own hair and makeup. I’m always looking for and learning new tips, but over the years I’ve figured out some things that work for me.
I’m definitely not a beauty guru, but that morning I was feeling ambitious. Considering it was my first time filming a video like this, maybe next time I shouldn’t do it when I have somewhere to be (like be on time for a TODAY Show appearance)
[SPOILER: I didn’t include putting on lipstick in this video]
Hope you guys enjoy seeing an overview of what I do. Maybe in the future, I can film shorter videos that go into more detail. Maybe I'll do a video completely dedicated to eyeliner!
*Alex helped me with the text and effects because he has “quality” standards for our videos. lol
*Hopefully after helping me with this edit, he won't be completely lost if we do a video where he does my makeup!
*I don’t mention any brand names because of Rule 40. Sorry! I will come back and add a product list in March.
Thanks for watching!!

» Subscribe to NowThis Nerd: http://go.nowth.is/Nerd_Subscribe

Visual effects have come a long way over the decades, and in 2017 we have the capability to translate everything in our imaginations straight to the screen. When it comes to the introduction of movie CGI, before and after, special effects have always been a big factor behind the scenes, but the best of VFX creates a seamless illusion of special effects that might only be revealed in behind the scenes footage, making of documentaries, and any given VFX breakdown. From miniatures to motion capture, the magic behind the making of visual effects is a complex art form based on a century of evolution, and while it’s hard to impress modern audiences, there were still plenty of awesome special effects that took our breath away in 2017.

The Blade Runner 2049 visual effects went a long way towards making it one of the most beautiful movie of the year, and it’s a guarantee that it will make any top 10 special effects lists you might see. But for all the awesome CGI holograms and deaging in the Blade Runner 2049 vfx, the most impressive by far were the Blade Runner 2049 miniatures created by Weta Workshop. It’s one of the oldest techniques around, but with modern techniques it creates realistic, substantial scenes that most computers still struggle with. Another creation from Weta Digital turned human actor Andy Serkis into the Planet of the Apes Caesar, one of the most convincing digital creations ever seen. In War for the Planet of the Apes, Weta’s motion capture process has never been more impressive, and it was sad to see the trilogy end before we could see how much further they could take this damned, dirty ape. Marvel Studios delivered some impressive Guardians of the Galaxy special effects in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, visual effects that used cutting edge fractals to render the massive scope of Guardians of the Galaxy Ego the Living Planet. And finally, we have to remark on some of the awesome practical effects of 2017. In Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan used real World War II planes to film the intense Dunkirk dogfight scenes, all with an IMAX camera bolted to the wings. In Baby Driver, director Edgar Wright pulled off the incredible Baby Driver stunts and Baby Driver car chase with a bare minimum of CGI. When it comes to special effects, practical effects, and every kind of visual effects, sometimes it’s best to keep it real.

In case you’re looking for smart tips on how to make your clothes white and soft nearly for free – these life hacks are just for you. You can use some simple things you have at home in the washing machine to get even the most stubborn stains out easily and make your clothes dry faster.


Aspirin gets deep into the fabric of stained clothes and effectively removes dirt. It's especially good for shirts with sweat stains since aspirin easily breaks up and lifts that frustrating yellowish tint. If you dissolve aspirin in cold water, it’ll help you get rid of blood stains on your clothes! It’s really important that the water be cold because hot water will only fix the proteins in the blood deep into the fabric.
Experienced laundry “gurus” don't recommend adding liquid fabric softener when washing your whites. And that’s because it doesn't let your clothes become as white as possible. Don't sort your clothes by their color, sort them by the density of the fabric. Heavy fabrics absorb more water than lighter ones, which is why the detergent gets washed out of different items in varying degrees.
Scientists have actually come up with something called the “Sock Loss Index”! Psychologist Simon Moore and statistician Geoff Ellis teamed up to develop a formula explaining where our lost socks go. Turns out, careless sock pairing and putting socks in the wrong wash are the biggest causers of the lost-sock mystery.

SUMMARY
-Putting some aspirin into the washing machine can help whiten and brighten your whites. And this effect is all thanks to the salicylic acid contained in these pills.
-If your goal is blindingly white whites, then all you need to use is bleach. Skip on the detergent and liquid fabric softener.
-Add half a cup of mouthwash to your detergent tray, run a full wash cycle, and that’s it. You’ve effectively destroyed fungus, mold, and harmful bacteria.
-Using baby shampoo you’ll ""relax"" the fibers in the garment. And this will make it possible to stretch the fabric back to its original shape and size.
-Don't sort your clothes by their color, sort them by the density of the fabric. Mixing your fabrics damages clothes with thin fibers.
-To remove makeup from your clothes, you can put regular ol’ shaving cream on the stain and just wash the items as you normally would.
-You can actually get rid of old non-protein stains, such as those from grass, soil, or juice (but not blood), by heating them up with a hairdryer and then putting a little detergent on the spot.
-If you don’t have time to wait for your dryer to finish a load, just throw a dry towel into the machine. The towel will absorb the moisture in the clothes, cutting drying time way down.
-To avoid losing or mixing socks and undies, it’s a good idea to use special bags to wash small pieces of clothing for each member of the family.
-It's easier to iron clothes that are still a little damp. It's even possible to iron clothes (especially dress shirts and other items made from thin fabric) straight out of the washer.

Lyrics:
What can he do that I can't?
You tell me he sees the good in the world
and I bury my head in my hands.

What can I do to prepare?
You tell me to brace for the hurricane 'cause the end of a good thing is here.

Tell me something new.

Do you think for yourself or is this your friends
that are doing away with me?
I'll surrender my love for you.
It's all I got but I'll let it go.
Try to put my faith in you; You fucked it all up.
Can't seem to tell the truth
but I see right through.

Well you fucked me up too.

I see what a theif you've become.
You covered your tracks
but the lies resonate through these halls.
I'm so alone now
but I'll get by somehow.

Tell me something new.
So tell me!

Do you think for yourself or is this your friends
that are doing away with me?
I'll surrender my love for you.
It's all I got but I'll let it go.
Try to put my faith in you; You fucked it all up.
Can't seem to tell the truth
but I see right through.

Hoping you'll stay here.
Please turn him away dear.
I'll give you my all.
I'll pay the consequences.

Do you think for yourself or is this your friends
that are doing away with me?
I'll surrender my love for you.
It's all I got but I'll let it go.
Try to put my faith in you; You fucked it all up.

Narrated by Richard Dimbleby.

The singers at the Coronation were drawn from the choirs of Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral, the Chapel Royal and St George’s Chapel, Windsor, supplemented by 12 boy trebles chosen from various British cathedral choirs. In addition, the Royal School of Church Music conducted auditions to find twenty boy trebles from parish church choirs to represent the various regions of the United Kingdom; these choristers spent the month before the service training at Addington Palace. The final complement of singers numbered 182 boy trebles, 37 altos, 62 tenors and 67 basses. Together with a full orchestra, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult, the total number of musicians was 480.

For those interested in such matters, this is a rare opportunity to hear a liturgically-relevant performance of Parry’s “I was glad”, including the “Vivats” sung by the Queen’s Scholars of Westminster School as prescribed in the music score.

In this episode of the Sidcourse, we take a personal look at Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice and living with psychosis.

Join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/K3cWKRN

Video games are a unique medium and through it, developers are able to craft experiences that allow players to empathise with different situations. In recent years, it's been an incredible medium to address the topic of mental health.

Hellblade is one of the first game's to tackle the topic of psychosis. Characterised as an impaired relationship with reality. People suffering from psychosis experience delusions and/or hallucinations. Where a delusion is a false belief or impression that is held even though it’s contradictory to the truth. And hallucinations are seeing, hearing, feeling or smelling things or people that are not present.

As an incredibly volatile and dangerous set of symptoms, games as a medium are an incredible method of showcasing, sharing and ultimately allowing the player to empathise and understand the struggle for those living with psychosis.

Which Tunnel should I crawl into?
▶ Watch Trapped in Abandoned Tesla - https://youtu.be/LETFEKDwZrw

Last week we found the $100,000 Abandoned Tesla on our Treasure Hunt Adventure Challenge. We got stuck inside the Tesla for 24 HOURS at 3AM! It was like an escape room challenge. We don't know who is doing this to us yet but we think it could be one of our YouTuber friends like Papa Jake, Stephen Sharer, Lizzy Sharer, or Carter Sharer pranking us!  The Tesla started self driving to the ABANDONED ZOO where we continued our Treasure Hunt. To finish the mystery, we had to complete the Do Not Crawl Through The Secret Hidden Abandoned Tunnel challenge. This was very similar to what Cam and Jeff did on their channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxD__MbmtFU. We had no spy gadgets or ninja gadgets to help us this time! After exploring the abandoned tunnels we had smash an egg on my head and delete Chad Wild Clay's YouTube video! Thanks for watching my friendly 2018 videos.

She caught him cheating

In her autobiography Wendy's Got the Heat: The Queen of Radio Tells All, Williams maintained Hunter messed around during their marriage.  At a 2013 interview with Vlad TV, she went into a little more detail, revealing that she found out Hunter was allegedly cheating on her in 2000, just after she had given birth to their son.  As Williams tells it, she heard about the infidelity through ""a late-night telephone call and some clandestine whispering.  You see, I'd already had the baby, so once you deliver a baby, the mother doesn't get much sleep anyway... So I overheard some shady conversation from the next room, [and I thought to myself], 'Who's he talking to?'

Alex Garland's Annihilation might be the prettiest end-of-the-world movie you'll ever see. Based on the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer, the movie tells the story of a group of scientists venturing into a strange quarantined zone called the Shimmer. Inside, they encounter a surreal world that seems to be remixing itself, and everything in it. The film juggles some heavy themes and has a lot going on in its narrative, so by the time it ends, it's a little difficult to unpack. Let's break down the ending of Annihilation...

Solo: A Star Wars Story flew a little low at the weekend box office, bringing in just $103 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend: a huge drop from early tracking, which predicted the movie bringing in $170 million or more. It also marks the lowest opening for any one of Disney's Star Wars films, below even Rogue One, the franchise's first standalone film.

But there are a lot of factors that contributed to Solo's disappointing box office performance, so let's take a look at the real reasons the film didn't perform as well as expected…

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

Athletics is generally a thankless pursuit. Unless you’re a member of a major professional sports league, much of your life will be exhausting your mental and physical capabilities for a mere chance at success. As an athlete, you will find no shortage of opportunities to compete and test yourself against others, but you will most likely fail. If you’re one of those rare competitors who succeed at a single level, there are still many more levels to conquer before you have that chance at greatness. And even once you’ve left all national competitors in your wake and have been invited to the Olympic qualifiers, competing against athletes from all over the world, you still need to place high, or you’ll wash out and fall back to zero, having to start over again or give up entirely. Further, even if you make the Olympics, greatness is achieved not merely by competing, or even medaling, but by breaking records. Then, only then, will your name not fade with the closing ceremony - and there will remain that ever-present chance that your triumph will be evoked by strangers, making the universe a little less lonely, and death a little less final. That’s what the following athletes feel – if we’re gracious enough to remember.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5A3UeF-uC1I/sddefault.jpg,0.011126712977051678,0.00019169528118103465,58.04375,0.0008949773440139555,0.011318408258232713,0.012213385602246671,2018-01-10,09:35:01,Wednesday,2,10,38,10,33,52,334,2,79,0,1,7,14,2,0,4.0,8.0,['Pra'],['Pra'],True,['pra'],1,1,3,0,0,0,0,6.161649692172072,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   

“Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). Peyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage.

“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. 

The creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”

The “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).
“Rampage” opens in theaters worldwide beginning April 20, 2018.

A New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

LYRICS
Any time, that you like
Gonna give you my heart to break
Angel eyes, tell me lies
Gonna give you my heart to break

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control?
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better
That's why I give you my heart to break

Butterflies, every time
Gonna give you my heart to break
Devilish, every kiss
Gonna give you my heart to break

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control? (Ahh)
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake (No)
'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better, that's why I)
That's why I give you my heart to break

Every time
Heart to break
Woo-ah!
Every time
Heart to break
Yeah

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control? Ahh
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more (more, more)

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it (I tried to fight, help it)
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better)
That's why I give you my heart to break

The simple answers are: better auto focus with dual pixel AF and better depth of field.  He was using the Panisonic GH5 which so many people swear by.  Sure that camera offers a lot of different bit rates and video features but you lose me at the super small sensor.

I've been using the 6D Mark II since it came out for Vlogging and used it in this video as well.

To get started with the Raspberry Pi as a hacking platform, you'll need a few key components to get the Pi up and running our ethical hacking version of Kali Linux. Initially, you'll need access to another computer to burn your Kali image to an SD card. You'll also need a good power adapter, SD card, keyboard/mouse combo, wireless network adapter, and a USB Rubber Ducky.

This is where you can follow for 'Insta-mas' if you want to.

Some playlists of my previous attempts of Vlogmas. 

2016 - Didn't do vlogmas. Finished writing a book, Wilde Like Me (that turned out to be a Sunday Times Number One Best Seller) and was falling madly, wildly in love with a good man (who this Christmas I'm having a baby with), squishing Darcy and loving life. Glad that turned out well!!

2015- The last month of one of the hardest years of my life, coming to terms with being a single Mum, being entirely messed around by an American man who I thought loved me (but didn't), still trying to kid myself that I was OK and make a perfect Christmas for Darcy! YAY!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APX6wbM4bYM&list=PLtXezWnjqnkLecVM1iNzRGcFb9VIAchS9

2014 - The vlogmas I was going through a total marriage breakdown but hadn't 'gone public' with it. Cool. Super fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeMUgLzkVT4&list=PLtXezWnjqnkL9_Ad9u__tJl91CB0IdM7R

2013 - The year I only managed 10 vlogs, despite not being sad or a broken woman! Weird!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paRgD1la5OI&list=PLtXezWnjqnkI_4ux8qGqCATK0mZ6kbkn_

I'm sensing that maybe vlogmas isn't for me! Saying that, I'm so glad I did them because watching tiny Darcy back, hearing her voice, reminding myself of her toddler mannerisms has been lovely. She is always the best part of any month.

Our visit to the USA has been incredible. We have formed incredible friendships and made memories that will last a life-time. North America feels like a second home to us and so to help us travel more in the future, together with the team from Tiny House Chattanooga (http://www.tinyhousechattanooga.com) we have built a Tiny House on wheels!!!

The home was constructed on a trailer from Tiny House Foundations (http://www.tinyhousefoundations.com). The trailer is the foundation of your home, so especially with a traveling tiny house like this one choosing a high quality trailer was incredibly important.

The design of this tiny house is the culmination of inspiration from my travels over the last years, where I have borrowed many of my favourite design features of the homes we have visited and included them in this tiny home on wheels.

You can find out more information about this home, including more details about the items found in the home and the suppliers on our website: http://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/our-traveling-tiny-home-in-north-america/

LYRICS :
[Intro]
""When it comes to drugs, pill-pushers and takers, we are a country virtually out of control. If you're feeling depressed, to get relief, take a pill. Most of us are addicts.""

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Life gets hard sometimes I know
So I be leaning, I be smoking my dope
I see your face everywhere that I go
It's the only thing that reminds me of home
I be with my team racing whips on the roll
Rolling off a bean that I took at the show
Young limousine I'm a backseat rider
She only calls my phone when she thinks that I'm dying
Baby you're the one for me that's fosho
I just need your company so ride slow
This ain't what you want from me so cold
Girl you're the only one for me I know

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll go with you
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you want one, then I'll find myself
If you're leaving, then I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you, I'll leave with you
Cold Hart, baby, GothBoiClique

[Verse 2: Cold Hart]
Yeah she asking me, ""What are we?""
I'm like, ""What you mean?""
I'm smoking gasoline with my team
GBC, they'll be there with me
And I know I ain't shit but you a Master Piece
Kurt Cobain jeans, you my Courtney Love
Thraxxl Rose how I got the club going up
Taking bars for anxiety
Smoking kush is my therapy

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll go with you
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you want one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you

[Outro]
""A lot of people have seen their friends die. I don't want anyone to see any of their friends die anymore.""

The tournament will see the long-awaited return of 14-time major winner Tiger Woods, after nine months of absence due to an injury.

Following is the transcript of the video:

Snapchats from Androids are much worse than from iPhones. That’s because it’s way easier to develop an app for iPhone. Developers only have to consider a few Apple devices. But for Android, there are hundreds of different phones — all with different screen sizes, running different versions of Android software.

Snapchat found a way around developing too many different versions of their Android app.

Instead of taking an actual photo with your actual camera, the app just takes a screengrab of your camera view. This way, one image capture method works on most Android phones, even if the picture is worse for it.

There are a few Android devices, like the Google Pixel 2, that actually use the camera on Snapchat. But next time you see a bad photo from your friend on Android, you know why...it's probably just a screengrab.

On a Q3 earnings call, Snapchat suggested they would be making some improvements to their Android app. CEO Evan Spiegel said, ""Given the sheer volume of different Android handsets used to access Snapchat, we have had to establish new processes to ensure that our quality efforts can be maintained.

What Hi-Fi article 
(quoted in the video)
https://www.whathifi.com/features/holy-grail-vinyl-art-half-speed-mastering

Clearly a short video like this can't hope to cover every possible aspect of the complete history of Reel to Reel from 1928 to 2017...for example it's missing facts like the first stereo tapes were recorded in Germany in the early 1940s, how the different thicknesses and formulations of tapes affect sound quality, and why tails-out storage of tapes is recommended. If you would like more information on reel to reel the following website is a great place to start: http://reel2reeltexas.com/index.html

If you are shopping for a Reel to Reel machine on ebay  - here's my affiliated link http://ebay.to/2j1afnA

UPDATE:  DUPLICATION PROCESS The company that I contacted have now answered my questions and clarified their duplication process. 
They borrow the master tape, make a copy (or more likely a number of identical parallel copies on a bank of tape machines)...they then use these copies as their master to run duplicates off that they sell to you. The original master is returned to the studio. 

The 1957 stereo demo tape can be heard in full on my website:
http://www.techmoan.com/blog/2017/12/14/is-reel-to-reel-the-new-vinyl.html
...and yes the demo tape contains the voices of Art Gilmore as the narrator and June Foray as the bowler - you can see this written at the bottom of the tape box at 08:17

[Intro]
Sorry but- (Go ahead)
Oh no
What up, Bob? God, man
We're Hobo Johnson & Lovemakers, we're a couple kids - five I guess - that like to make a little bit of love, like to make a little bit of music. Look at that, it's a desk, just kidding Bob, it's a table. I don't care about rules!

[Verse 1]
Hi, what’s your name? How are you? How’s your life?
Oh, you got a man? Are you in love? If so, what type?
Is it just platonic, strictly just as friends
Or the type that ties you two together 'til tomorrow’s end?
If it is, disregard every time I call you pretty
Though it’s meant sincerely it’s just my imagination drifting
Brush me off like the dirt on Jay-Z’s shoulders
So I fall to ground, collect myself and get ready to take over your heart
Or at least your spare time

[Chorus]
And I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone
The second one’s way sadder than the first one
But I don’t know
I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone
Man, fuck, I really love being in love
But I also really love not crying on the-

[Verse 2]
We should go get a cup of coffee
And I’ll act friendly and I won’t pull any stunts
But I’m a freaking stunt puller from birth
So I don’t know what to tell you
If I try to confess my love for, scones
I just wanna tell you real quick please shh
I love, these scones
Just the diversity between the selection
The raspberry, the blueberry, the strawberry, pumpkin, even
Which is basically a fucking squash
How do you even make a scone out of a freaking squash?
It blows my mind, oh man
But what are you talking about?
I’m so sorry to interrupt
Oh yeah, your boyfriend made you mad the other day?
What was he saying? What was he talking about?
Oh my god, that’s crazy
What do I think? Hm, let me think about it
Let me think about it, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm
He was being mean at that time
But I’m sure he’s gonna turn around at some point, and

[Chorus]
I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone
Man, I really love being in love
But I also really love not crying on the phone
Man, I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone
I don’t know, the second one’s way sadder than the first one
But, I don’t know
[Verse 3]
Hi, wassup?
Yeah, what’s going on?
Oh yeah, she told me a lot about you, yeah, uh huh
It’s so great that you’re doing all of those things
You should keep doing all of them I think
Oh yeah my name’s Hobo Johnson I’m a rapper
I’m actually not a rapper, I like to say a musician
I play guitar sometimes too I’m just not as good as Derek
It doesn’t matter but
She is like the nicest person I’ve ever met in my whole life
And I’m sure you know it ‘cause you sleep next to her every night
And you guys would probably cuddle and kiss or whatever
But she, you know, she is just so sweet and she cared about me a lot when no one else cared about me and I think that’s really nice
Really you know, she’s just a, she's just a peach
She’s a peach
Scone
She's a peach scone, Bob
And

[Outro]
I love the thought of being with her
I just really hope that she doesn’t get hurt, man
They say it takes two years to come back down to earth
From that lovely place that you’ve been, I heard it’s so nice
I heard it’s so nice, good for you, I’m glad
And if you find someone that really loves you for who you are
Keep being with them, man
‘Cause that’s what matters in this life, Bob
Thank you

Games like Final Fantasy XV, The Division, Rainbox Six Siege, and Fortnite battle royale all do this and now more recently we have seen Metal Gear Survive clearly trying the same thing.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5MqhY3i7Jo0/sddefault.jpg,0.07157136093429428,0.0039454995002367295,18.14,0.026408543321584512,0.07551686043453101,0.10192540375611553,2018-02-27,16:01:37,Tuesday,1,11,67,11,62,51,543,4,130,4,2,8,17,4,2,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.69975231168929,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Camila Cabello releases TWO tracks off her debut album and one of them might be shading Fifth Harmony.

I just heard Camila’s two new singles and I’ll never be the same.

It feels like we’ve been waiting forever for Cami’s debut album, and we finally have a release date PLUS two new songs to hold us over till it drops. The two tracks are called ‘Never Be The Same’ and ‘Real Friends’ and they are both insanely catchy. 
‘Never Be The Same’ is all about that high you feel when you’re in love and having that person change you. Take a listen.

Then the track ‘Real Friends’ is actually about fake friends, ironically enough. In the song, Camila calls out some people in her life that don’t seem to be there for the right reasons. Many fans are thinking this song could potentially be about Fifth Harmony, considering the fall out they all had when Camila left the group.
 Not to mention, ‘I Have Questions’ was also speculated to be about Fifth Harmony, and that song was all about feeling betrayed by someone you trusted. One line from the new track even says “No, I think I’ll stay in tonight, skip the conversations and the “oh, I’m fines.” We do know she started writing songs in hotel bathrooms, while on tour with Fifth Harmony. So maybe she stayed in to skip the conversations and write this song. We’re not sure. Either way, it’s fire.

We are so excited for Camila’s upcoming album, which will officially drop on January 12th. We still have eight more songs to look forward to, and we can’t help but wonder if any of those tracks will be an epic collab. Camila has stated that she’s reluctant to collab with other artists, because she “collaborated for five years” with Fifth Harmony. But she did mention a couple musicians that she would not mind working with. During an interview with SiriusXM, Camila said “I would love to do something with Kendrick Lamar. The 1975. I don’t know if you guys know them. Yea, they’re awesome.”

So I guess we will have to wait and see if either of those collabs happen. What did you guys think of Camila’s new songs? Which one is your fav so far? Let me know in the comments below, and when you’re done with that, make sure to hit that subscribe button. Thanks so much for hanging out with me on Clevver News, I’m your girl Renee Ariel and I’ll see you next time.

Hip-Hop's profile has never been bigger, and the rugged trap music of Atlanta has transcended the genre to influence mainstream popular music and culture. As a new generation of talent pushes the music's popularity to new heights, Zaytoven cements his status as one of modern Hip-Hop's most impactful and prolific producers.

Zaytoven's studio in his parent's basement was the incubator for some of the scene's greatest talents. While his list of collaborators is extensive, one of his most notable partnerships is with ATL icon Gucci Mane. The work they created together is genre defining, and the two continue to be a driving force in Hip-Hop.

Phenomenally talented and remarkably humble, Zay's commitment to his values and faith has kept him on his creative path as he continues to gift us with more music.

Welcome back to the final day of what you can cook for the price of one coffee a day. The cool thing is that even if you don't buy Starbucks large coffees, each meal is the price of extremely cheap coffee, so it's a freakin win-win folks.

ISLE OF DOGS tells the story of ATARI KOBAYASHI, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump called Trash Island, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies across the river in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

A vast majority of Americans, somewhere in the neighborhood of 87% support DACA, but all of a sudden, this is becoming a polarizing issue. So, we found some Americans who say they do not support DACA and Jimmy introduces them to a real family whose future is relying on it to see if we could bring people together by bringing them face to face.

Our first week with baby - http://bit.ly/2DTQHxF
My NEW Book - * http://amzn.to/2nrFlGI

So, I'm now a huge advocate for home births! Compared to my previous hospital birth, this was a LOT more relaxed, uncomplicated and positive. I forgot to mention that in this birth I had minimal blood loss (approx 150ml compared to 1.5l with my first!), was upright and chatty minutes after (compared to being woozy and confused last time) and despite having two small first degree tears, have not required stitches as the tears will heal naturally (not the case with my first delivery). I'm not a medical professional and would never say, 'HAVE A HOME BIRTH' to any woman because it's not my place but what I would say is, 'Look into the option of a home birth and consider if it's for you'. I never thought I'd be the kind of woman to do hypnotherapy or have a home water birth, I always thought it was all a bit airy fairy but I was wrong and have MUCH preferred this route! YAY!

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughter Darcy). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday and Sunday!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

요즘 계속 일교차가 심하지요! 옷차림에 꼭꼭 신경써주시고~

In this video I want to show you how I capture Deep Sky Objects, like nebulas and galaxys. It's the most complicated part of astrophotography and you need to prepare your telescope before you can image distant stars. In the end of the video you can see some Deep Sky Objects I captured, like the Orion Nebula and the Dumbbell Nebula. Hope you enjoy!

Molly is amazing and I was so happy to get to meet her a few vidcon's ago. WE finally got to film these collab challenges at the last vidcon and her idea was so much fun to do a NO MIRROR MAKEUP CHALLENGE. Since she is really good at putting makeup on without sight, she thought this would be such a fun makeup challenge for me to try my hardest! This was so much fun and I love Molly's story that inspires me and I think will inspire so many...that the love of makeup is so much more than what the eye sees. I hope you enjoy this makeup challenge and make sure to go see our challenge video on her channel!

About Kelsey:
Welcome to my channel! I'm a 25 year old preschool teacher turned YouTuber and entertainer.  I make ""lifestyle focused"" videos but honestly they're more sarcastic than anything. On my channel you can find me fighting with a food processor, making fun of people on the red carpet, or giving genuinely good advice (if I do say so myself). So join the #KelseySquad to be a part of the #KelseyFam and don't forget to be a proud #Kelsinator just kidding just watch my videos.

In this not planned episode of DIY or Buy we will have a look at my failed CD welder project. During the video I will show you how I designed the project and demonstrate how around 90% of it works. At the end though, I will tell you why this project failed and thus show you that buying can save you a lot of nerves.

All you have to do is follow some very simple rules and drink four glasses of water immediately after waking up. You gotta do it before you even brush your teeth or whatever you normally do first thing in the morning.
This Japanese practice improves your metabolism significantly and makes any diet way more tolerable. Improved metabolism brings about another wonderful surprise: weight loss. Your skin looks healthy, radiant, and youthful. Drinking water not only resulted in healthy hair growth but also made it look incredibly shiny. Something as simple and basic as drinking water on an empty stomach can help you deal with illnesses without having to resort to medicine.
This experiment is definitely worth a try. You become way more energized, feel a thousand times better, and all this inspires you to take care of yourself even more. If you're whether or not this experiment is for you, maybe because of some health problems, consult with your doctor first. As for everyone who’s willing to give it a shot, just remember to strictly follow all the rules.

SUMMARY
-Tons of studies have shown that the simple Japanese practice of drinking water on an empty stomach immediately after waking up every morning  has an overwhelmingly positive effect on different health conditions.
-To feel energized throughout the day, you should drink four glasses of water immediately after waking up. After you’ve gulped down your boatload of H20, do not eat anything for the next 45 minutes.
-A couple of days into the experiment, I started feeling more vibrant and less like a zombie. I could almost feel my body detoxifying, giving me more energy, and boosting my mood. 
-The Japanese practice also improved my metabolism significantly, which means I started losing weight without dieting. 
-Since I started my morning water routine, the fine lines and wrinkles on my face have diminished and now my skin looks healthy, radiant, and youthful. 
-Simple water solved this problem better than any antibiotics ever could: it helped get rid of chronic UTIs and improved overall health.
-Depending on the health issues you have, you can expect results from this Japanese water treatment after a certain amount of time. This experiment is definitely worth a try.

We love learning new facts about our favorite celebrity couples, but some things about the relationship between Cardi B and Offset are just plain confusing. We’re going to talk about some of the strange things about their romance that you might not know about. She lives in New York, he lives in Atlanta, and neither one is interested in moving any time soon. Even in spite of their pregnancy, it seems like these two might just end up having a long distance relationship. Despite us all seeing their engagement, they’ve given us reason to doubt that they’ll actually have a wedding someday. There has been a ton of drama and break ups between these two, and they both freely admit to it themselves! Because she’s been on the receiving end of cheating rumors, Cardi recently reached out to Khloe Kardashian to offer some advice. What do you make of their unusual relationship? Tell us in the comment section and then click subscribe for more from TheTalko.
