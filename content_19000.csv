Youtube superstar Pewdiepie had some not so great things to say about the MCU and other Marvel movies, including Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther. Today we're going to analyze his points of criticism and examine them further to see if there is indeed truth to them.

SpaceX wanted to land 3 rockets that day. But only 2 made it back to Earth in one piece. The Falcon Heavy is a beast, fueled by 3 main parts. Two booster rockets on the side and one core stage in the center.

Each part runs on 9 engines. That's 27 total engines it takes to lift this rocket to space. The two side boosters landed at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The center core was supposed to land on a drone ship in the ocean. But it missed the mark by 328 feet and crashed into the Atlantic instead.

Now we know why.

Rockets save a little fuel in their tanks for landing. It fuels the engines that fire to slow down the rocket. But two-thirds of the central core's engines didn't fire on landing. Six days after the crash, Musk tweeted the reason: ""Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engines relights. Fix is pretty obvious.""

Crashes like this aren't new for SpaceX. In fact, it released a video of all its fails back in 2017. SpaceX is famous for learning from its failures to fix them the next time around. On the same day, Musk revealed more news. 

SpaceX is currently building a second drone ship that will sail off Florida's coast. The two ships will be there for ocean landings of Falcon Heavy's side boosters. There is at least 2 more Falcon Heavy mission scheduled for 2018.

14. Yellow Anaconda
When most people think of an anaconda, they are thinking of the green anaconda. But the yellow anaconda is the smallest species of anaconda there is, if you can consider it small! It reaches a maximum length of 10 feet (3 m). As its name suggests, this type of snake is usually yellow or greenish yellow with black or dark brown blotches, spots, and streaks. 
It is native to Paraguay, Bolivia, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina. They are threatened by illegal poaching and are hunted for their meat and skins. 
Anaconda generally refers to the Eunectes genus of snakes which are members of the boa family. Unlike most snakes that usually lay eggs, anacondas give birth to live young and live near bodies of water. If they catch their meal in the water, they will suffocate it to  and/or drown it, whichever comes first!   
The Yellow Anaconda is no exception and it is also not a picky eater! They’ll eat just about anything they can swallow.  The Telegraph newspaper reported a story about wildlife photographer Chris Brunskill who captured a ferocious battle between a jaguar and a yellow anaconda! Who do you think the winner was? Let us know in the comments below! The answer is coming up!! 

13. Eastern Indigo Snake
Indigo snakes are the longest snake species in the United States. The longest recorded specimen of the species measured over 9 feet (2.8 m) long! They’re called indigo snakes because their scales are a shiny blackish purple. They are not venomous but they do prey on other snakes, frogs, turtles, lizards, birds, and mammals including mice and rats. They are a bit uncommon and usually are only found in southeastern states like Georgia and Florida- you know how much snakes like Florida! A curious fact is that they love to wander, females will often live in an area of about 100 acres and males will use even 4 times that amount of space. They may often be found sharing a burrow with a gopher tortoise to protect them from the cold. They are listed as a threatened species because so many people have gone out into the wild to collect them for the pet trade. 
Speaking of being threatened, if the Eastern Indigo feels attacked, it will flatten its head, and hiss and vibrate its tail. Vibrating its tail produces a rattling sound that mimics the rattle of a rattlesnake. However, these snakes rarely bite and, when they do, remember, it is not venomous.

12. Bushmaster
This is the largest pit viper in the world! The bushmaster’s scientific name translated from latin literally means “Silent”. 
A pit viper is a type of venomous snake that possesses a sensitive pit  that allows it to accurately aim when striking. The pit allows it to detect another creature’s heat signature. How’s that for a super power! Not only can they see the world in the visible light spectrum like we can, but the pit serves as heat sensors, so they can also see in the infrared spectrum. 
Native to the scrublands and forests of southern central America to northern South America, it prefers damp areas with lots of rain. Their population is actually unknown because they live in dense forests and unexplored areas. 
There are three species of pit vipers and they are all large. The bushmaster ranges from 6.5 feet (2 m) to over 12 feet (3.5 m) making them the longest venomous snake found in the Americas!! They are considered the 2nd longest venomous snake in the world after the king cobra. 
A bushmaster may wait for weeks in a single location, waiting to ambush its prey, which is usually rodents. Few people have been bitten but just that little amount of data suggests that there is an 80% mortality rate, also making this snake the deadliest snake in the Americas. Fun fact: They are also the only egg-laying pit viper found in the Americas as well. This snake breaks all kinds of records!

Lyrics:
Merry Christmas ladies
Merry Christmas Mr. Buble
Are you ready to sing a little Jingle Bells
Yes
Jingle Bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle Bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way,
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, j-j-jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O' what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, j-j-jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O' what a lot fun
What a lot fun to ride and sing
In a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow
9we are dashing)
In a one-horse open sleigh,
(One-horse sleigh)
Over the fields we go,
(Over the fields we go, we go)
Laughing all the way,
(All the way)
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O' what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O' what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
O' what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
O' what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
(Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!)

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Anthony P - Hey John I feel like it was pretty recent fox announced the Multiple Man movie.  Between this, gambit, and anything fox had listed recently as an upcoming project, why do you think they've invested resources into getting these films in development when they knew they were selling it all off.  Surely if we found out this week about the deal being closed, fox had to anticipate this for some time?

PATREON Supporter Jorge G. Gallardo - How is the Disney/Fox deal acquisition and the FCC ruling against net neutrality related ? Can this net neutrality ruling affect Disney and its upcoming streaming service in a positive or negative way?

Richard Myers - Hey John. So a lot of people are talking about the mid-season finale of The Walking Dead. Unfortunately one of the main things they’re talking about is the ratings being in a freefall. This was the lowest rated mid-season finale since the show started. How much longer does this show have?

Connor Diaz - Hey John I absolutely LOVE you and your videos-I practice my English by watching your vids everyday. Edge of Tomorrow/Live Die Repeat is one of my favourite films, and I was wondering if there was any news about the sequel? Last I heard, Cruise pitched an idea that was liked, and it was centered around Emily Blunt's character. I think it was going to be a sort of spin-off movie?. However, I haven't heard anything since then. Thoughts?

Sara Wellstood - So they’re saying Star Wars TLJ is going to become the 2nd largest opening weekend in film history. Around the $215 million mark. This is more than Avengers, Jurassic World and any other movie other than The Force Awakens. What does it say about the importance of this franchise considering it’s been around 40 years and still making this kind of money?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NxhqAddCI8E/hqdefault.jpg,0.033689427681591375,0.0022772177756940487,14.794117647058822,0.007970262214929172,0.035966645457285416,0.043936907672214594,2017-12-17,18:20:23,Sunday,6,14,19,14,19,77,149,3,40,0,0,13,17,2,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.141242961420258,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

🔥Black Atlass & Jessie Reyez - Sacrifice (Lyrics/Lyric Video)

[Verse 1: Black Atlass]
I will never sacrifice my love, not even for you
You know I don't play it safe
Sometimes you have to break the rules

[Pre-Chorus: Black Atlass]
Yeah, we could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, so baby, give me something
Yeah, we could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, you know I do, too

[Chorus: Black Atlass]
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
Beautiful, mmm
How do you make dangerous look so beautiful?
And how come when you kiss, you turn me into this?
I fall in love, oozin' up the way you do that
Don't even got you yet, but I can't imagine losing you

[Pre-Chorus: Black Atlass & Jessie Reyez]
Yeah, we could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, so baby, give me something
We could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, you know I do, too

[Chorus: Black Atlass & Jessie Reyez]
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight

Well, the wait has ended for the Avalon, and the 2019 model — appearing at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit — arrives with the same treatment the Camry received.

That means a whole new look, a transition to the Toyota New Global Architecture platform and some new technology tricks up its sleeve that have me clapping. Let's get into the specifics of the cause for applause.

Exterior
There will be no confusing the 2019 Avalon for any of the previous versions. The styling changes are comprehensive, and the 2019 edition is longer, lower and wider. The old Avalon also had an awkward split between its grille and lower air opening, which the new car fixes by simply joining the two together. Limited and XLE models feature a dark-gray grille with a chrome border, while the XSE and Touring have a piano-black mesh grille (seen on the blue car in the gallery above) that's more attention-grabbing.

The sides and rear of the car have been changed up, as well, adding angles and folds in the body work that make the Avalon look a lot more aggressive. I'm not sure how that jibes with the Avalon's most austere appearance and driving experience in previous models, but we can say at the very least that it's more interesting.

New LED headlights with adaptive-cornering LED lamps that activate when the car steers to provide better visibility in that direction are also standard on Limited and Touring models.

Interior
The center console ditches its tiered setup for a new vertically oriented panel that sits atop two supporting beams on either side of the shifter. The panel houses climate and multimedia controls, and it effectively splits the dashboard in two.

What's most exciting to us will be the updates to the multimedia system, which features a 9-inch touchscreen. Toyota has also added Apple CarPlay as standard on the Avalon, though Android users are still out of luck. Also new for 2019 is Amazon Alexa-enabled device connectivity, which allows the user to lock and unlock doors, remote start the engine or check fuel levels from any Alexa-enabled device. Charging options are numerous: There are five total USB ports, one for each passenger.

Other interior highlights include a wireless charging pad, available 10-inch head-up display, Wi-Fi hot spot capability and a new cognac-colored leather upholstery on Limited models.

Under the Hood
The 2019 Avalon will have two new powertrains, one a V-6 and the other a hybrid system for the Avalon Hybrid. Toyota has not yet published power figures for either powertrain, but we do know a few details: The 3.5-liter V-6 will be mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission that includes paddle shifters and rev-matching on V-6-equipped XSE and Touring models.

The Avalon Hybrid will utilize a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine in combination with a dual electric motor hybrid system, mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. The battery pack has been moved from the trunk to under the rear seat, which should open up some more cargo room.

Toyota has also introduced a new adaptive variable suspension for Touring models, which adjusts damping forces in real time to limit body roll while also absorbing road imperfections. All Avalons also get a new multilink rear suspension with thicker stabilizer bars and stiffer spring rates in an effort to increase the Avalon's handling prowess.

Safety
Toyota Safety Sense P will come standard on the Avalon. This safety system includes autonomous emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and automatic high beams. Also available are blind spot warnings, a surround-view camera system, parking sensors and a rear cross-traffic braking system.

The 2019 Avalon will arrive in dealerships in late spring.

""On the anniversary of the largest single day protest in American history, the organizers of the 2017 Women's March on Washington gathered in Las Vegas to roll out the next phase of the movement. This year, it's all about the ballot box. Forecasters are already pointing to factors that suggest 2018 will be a wave election, but if the women behind last year's worldwide demonstrations have anything to do with it, it will be more like a tsunami. Women's March Inc. is determined to register one million people before this year's midterm elections. With that goal in mind, they had volunteers stationed throughout the crowd with clipboards signing demonstrators up to vote.”*

I've been riding Scooters for over a decade now and it has taken me all around the world, as well as opened up so many doors in my life. It even paid me enough to own my first home at only 21 years of age!

I have decided to take you all on a little tour around my house to show you what it's like and how I live. I also have a huge project going on in my backyard and I give a little insight on what thats going to be!

Keep shredding everyone and don't listen to the haters, because I can tell you first hand, if I listened to them, my life would be no where near as good as it is today!

Thank for watching, make sure you smack that thumbs up button for me!

Luke isn't seen as a character to Lucasfilms instead he is a chess piece to be used however they need. That's the problem. It's not about ""killing nostalgia"" we never understood why Luke acted so out of character. This doesn't make the OT anymore ""real"" it just ruins them. It ruins there characters. And honestly I'm sick of people saying it's sexists or ""non progressive"" to not like this film. As a movie it simply sucked. It's a fun action film, with little to no depth. Doesn't hold a candle on the OT.
But yea tell me your thoughts down below!

The same blood-sucking leeches feared by hikers and swimmers are making a comeback... in hospitals. Once used for questionable treatments, leeches now help doctors complete complex surgeries to reattach severed body parts.

DEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. 

Leeches get a bad rap—but they might not deserve it. Yes, they’re creepy crawly blood-suckers. And they can instill an almost primal sense of disgust and revulsion. Humphrey Bogart’s character in the 1951 film The African Queen even went so far as to call them “filthy little devils.”

But the humble leech is making a comeback. Contrary to the typical, derogatory definition of a human “leech,” this critter is increasingly playing a key role as a sidekick for scientists and doctors, simply by being its bloodthirsty self.

Distant cousins of the earthworm, most leech species are parasites that feed on the blood of animals and humans alike. They are often found in freshwater and navigate either by swimming or by inching themselves along, using two suckers—one at each end of their body—to anchor themselves.

Upon reaching an unsuspecting host, a leech will surreptitiously attach itself and begin to feed. It uses a triangular set of three teeth to cut in, and secretes a suite of chemicals to thin the blood and numb the skin so its presence goes undetected.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

""As long as we’re living and breathing, there’s more we can do. We just have to be strong enough.""

I think many people have already heard the terrible news that The Expanse has been canceled by Syfy after three seasons. This is my regular video and it probably doesn't mean anything, but you can see what a huge world the series ""The Expanse"" is. Wonderful shots, the work of operators, actors and the entire team of the series. This is really the best sci-fi series of our time!  So it's very sad that such a beautiful show is cancelled. I really hope that someone will save The Expanse and we will see the 4th season. The series, the actors and crew deserve it. 
You can also take part on rescue the show. You ask how to do this? Here are some instructions:

• If you are a fan of The Expanse please watch it live on Wednesday 9/8c on SyFy
• If you're not home leave your tv on & tuned to syfy
• If you DVR it, watch it
• If you don't have cable find it on Amazon, Google, or iTunes.

Also. Support the show by contacting Amazon and signing the petition at http://bit.ly/SaveTheExpanse

In order for RoDyMan to learn from the best, the project has engaged a famous Neapolitan pizzaiolo, Enzo Coccia, who had to wear a biokinetic sensorized suit so that the robot could record and replicate his movements.

The goal of the project is to create a robot that can dynamically manipulate deformable objects, such as the pizza dough, making it able to undertake tasks that are typically considered as human-executed. According to Prof. Siciliano, the project is still under development and its expected year of completion is in 2019 when he wishes to showcase the robot at Naples' pizza festival.

MAIN TOPICS
Randy K - Hi John love the show. I just heard the most exciting news ever, Steven Spielberg is finally going to to direct a comic book movie, now my question is ... why do you think he chose the DC project Blackhawk? Thanks and keep bringing on the filthy.

Jordan Naffek - Was wondering if you saw the article in Variety about the Academy board member who just resigned and blasted the Academy on his way out. He criticized them for nominating small films and having a long boring show and for how they handled the Harvey Weinstein situation. Have you seen it? If so, what is your takeaway from it?

The World Of 5 - Hey John! How are you. I'm making my summer box office predictions and was wondering; What do you think will make more money: Solo or Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. I think Solo will make more because of the Star Wars but both movies to do fine.

Golden Globe-nominated EMPIRE is now in its sixth and final season as one of television’s most popular and groundbreaking shows. A powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and often dangerous world of hip-hop music, the show revolves around the Lyons and their media company, Empire Entertainment.

As Season Five hurtled toward its conclusion, LUCIOUS (Terrence DaShon Howard) was forced to flee New York City, with the Feds hot on his trail. To make matters worse, COOKIE (Golden Globe winner Taraji P. Henson) refused to accompany him, declaring that he and Empire were no longer good for her. Season Six begins with the Lyon family splintered. Lucious is on the run and Cookie is finding success on her own. With Jamal residing in London and HAKEEM (Bryshere Y. Gray) starring in “Empire: The Movie,” Andre (Trai Byers) finds himself finally sitting on the Empire throne. Faced with threats from all directions, the Lyons will have to reunite to survive. They will have to decide what's most important – Empire or their family.

From Imagine Television in association with 20th Century Fox Television, EMPIRE was created by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and Emmy Award winner Danny Strong, and is executive-produced by Daniels, Strong, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Sanaa Hamri, Dennis Hammer and Matt Pyken. Brett Mahoney is executive producer and showrunner for the series.

But when they get the chance to reunite for an overseas USO tour, this group of awesome nerds comes together to make some music, and some questionable decisions, one last time.

Every conversation yields insights, inspiration and plenty of surprises as moderators and audience members ask questions.

GIVEAWAY DETAILS
- Comment (ONE PER PERSON) below in this video what YOUR favorite product that I mentioned (OR the products you want me to include in the haul update in 2 weeks!!)

- I want to choose subscribers ON Youtube, so the only way I can think of to choose the winner fairly, is to have the WINNERS USERNAME announced in a comment in the community tab (which should show up on your subscription feed)
- The winner will need to message me ON YOUTUBE: click on the 'about' tab, and then the 'send message' icon under 'stats') with your mailing information for the purposes of mailing you your prize

I hope the above makes sense to everyone, I want it to be fair and I don't want people e-mailing me pretending to be the winner.

This is not as popular of a hospital drama show in ratings compared to monsters like House or Grey's anatomy but it still has a large fanbase and does well on CBS. After watching the show I was pleasantly surprised at not only how accurate code black is but also how much I enjoyed it. It really felt as if a doctor wrote the script and then it was fluffed up instead of the other way around. If you like this show please let me know in the comments so that I can watch and react to more episodes (suggestions welcome).

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches Code Black / Real Doctor Reacts to Code Black. If you want me to continue making this medical drama review series please like the video and leave me a comment on which tv drama or show you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBUNP9eruRc/sddefault.jpg,0.00792524084134384,0.00014004652949225165,56.59005524861878,0.000224848184919604,0.008065287370836092,0.008290135555755695,2017-12-14,09:35:00,Thursday,3,7,38,7,33,46,334,2,79,0,1,5,14,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.442279789273759,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"{'backpack': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Many of you have asked about my must haves for the baby, so Timmy and I decided to do a short but informative video about all the things we use on and for Sonny on a daily basis. Some of this is very specific to his age so if you decide to purchase something make sure it’s the right size and age appropriateness for your baby. Also, there’s a couple things he’s now grown out of like size 3 diapers and the swaddle so I added some new things in the links on my blog to shop -- http://whitneyport.com/2017/12/14/chapter-32-love-baby-products/

Here’s a list of survival tips that can save your life in an emergency. 
We live in a time when natural disasters occur more and more often and get more and more devastating. Many of us believe we should blame the human race for that. Whether it’s true or not, we all want to know how to survive when those disasters happen. 

Some rules are universal for most natural disasters. A national campaign called Ready was started in the United States to inform the population about how to get ready for and survive in different emergency situations. It recommends having a basic survival kit to provide you with the most important things just in case. Remember you will need to have enough food, water, and other supplies for at least 72 hours after the disaster. 
“Other supplies” include a battery powered weather radio, flashlight, first aid kit, a whistle, a dust mask, personal sanitation items (such as moist towelettes), pliers, can opener for food, maps of your area and an emergency cell phone with backup batteries. 

TIMESTAMPS
Hurricane 0:40
Tornado 1:45
Tsunami 3:15
Flood 4:10
Avalanche 5:03
Wildfire 6:00
Earthquake 7:00

SUMMARY
- If a hurricane starts while you are driving, leave your vehicle and find a building to shelter in, or a ditch. Stopping in an overpass will not save you. If your home is a trailer and there is enough time to flee to a safe area – do it. 
- If a tornado starts when you are in a public building, follow the same rules. You want to stay as low as possible. Avoid windows and open spaces such as auditoriums, gyms, and large hallways. Desks and benches can give you some extra protection if you get under them. It is impossible to outrun a tornado. 
- Tsunamis are so fast they hit the coast minutes after the earthquake. Remember that tall buildings, including hotels right in the beach area, can provide an excellent shelter. In case a tsunami finds you at sea, stay there instead of going back to the coast. It won’t be a safe haven. 
- Don’t try to be the bravest person around and stay in your house once you hear the evacuation warning. Leave for safety in higher grounds with your important papers in a waterproof container. If a flash flood gives you no time to evacuate and the water is all around you, don’t try to swim across it. 
- When an avalanche starts, try to move to the side of the slope as fast as you can. There will be more snow in the center of the flow. To move faster, drop any heavy equipment you have on you. If you can’t escape it, try using a sturdy tree to keep you above the snow. 
- If you find yourself in a wildfire area, it is critically important to ensure that you can breathe. If you fail to do it, you can pass out in the midst of a danger zone. Use a wet cloth to cover your nose and mouth and escape to safety.
- If an earthquake starts when you are inside, stay where you were. Experts say that during an earthquake you must drop to the floor, get underneath a table, cover your neck and head with one hand, and hold on with the other hand. Your entire body must be under the table. Don’t try to run out of the building - the exterior of a building is one of the most dangerous places.

Happy start of the week. This is a room tour of my dorm at RISD for the 2017-2018 academic year. At the moment I am moved out, with my things stored at tyler's before our upcoming apartment lease begins on the first of the next month!

It is quite exciting getting to move off campus, because there will be certain freedoms (such as drilling things in walls, not having to use sticky hooks anymore & painting them too!) Still haven't planned in too much detail how I want to decorate my room in the next place. I have a feeling I will just go with it and keep adjusting things until it feels right!

However, I still loved being in this place so much this entire year. The location and the impeccable view has been such a blessing these last several months, being able to see the beautiful sunshine and the changing seasons from my little room. I want to thank my mom so much for financially supporting my sister and i in the room and board here at school. Next year we are paying our own bills for the first time! taking our steps into adulthood... kind of exciting, and nerve-racking.

It is an amazing gift to be able to have shared the memories in this place with you through the vlogs this year. Also, this room tour too. It is because of this community that I will be able to afford rent next year, and also financially supporting myself and a little furry friend i am hoping to welcome home as soon as i get the apartment set up! Cannot express enough how thankful i am. Not only that, our loving and warm community creates a positive and friendly environment to share our thoughts and ideas, and there needs to be more of that~

tell me how you are doing, I am very eager to read your thoughts and they mean very much to me. The time you spend here is very appreciated! Thank you, so much. I will see you soon. So many changes coming our way, lets embrace and make the best out of them! Sending you love and happy thoughts. muah.

Love,

Vance, Akira Ito, and producer Jeremy Dawson discussed the making of their stop-motion animation in a conversation moderated by Kent Jones.

Isle of Dogs tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage dump, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies to Trash Island in search of his bodyguard dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture. Starring Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Kunichi Nomura, Akira Takayama, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Akira Ito, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Yoko Ono, Tilda Swinton, Ken Watanabe, Mari Natsuki, Fisher Stevens, Nijiro Murakami, Liev Schreiber, and Courtney B. Vance.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center is devoted to supporting the art and elevating the craft of cinema. The only branch of the world-renowned arts complex Lincoln Center to shine a light on the everlasting yet evolving importance of the moving image, this nonprofit organization was founded in 1969 to celebrate American and international film. Via year-round programming and discussions; its annual New York Film Festival; and its publications, including Film Comment, the U.S.’s premier magazine about films and film culture, the Film Society endeavors to make the discussion and appreciation of cinema accessible to a broader audience, as well as to ensure that it will remain an essential art form for years to come.

By the age of eight I’d convinced the other kids that my hair was made of sponge… because being black it couldn’t be made of ‘hair’.”

Through her own personal story and the hair-raising experiences of other women and girls, Mena Fombo’s TEDxBristol talk is a witty, yet compelling and sometimes dark exploration of the objectification of black women. It's an issue she has spent a lifetime experiencing and exploring, with both a political and creative lens. 

Mena is the driving force behind the international campaign “No. You Cannot Touch My Hair” which has attracted contributions from people across the UK and around the world. Over half the respondents said they had their hair touched on a monthly basis by people they’d never met before. 18% said it happened every week. The vast majority described the touching as intrusive, invasive and unwelcome. 90% of those responding identified as female, and the majority were black or of mixed race origin. Some said it felt like being petted in a zoo. Mena says: “We are not animals in zoos - #DONTTOUCH”. 
 Mena Fombo describes herself as a British Nigerian Bristolian through and through! She is a purposeful coach, facilitator, motivational speaker, consultant and activist with a background working in the arts, the voluntary sector and educational establishments across Europe, the USA, Africa and South Asia.

She is also the founder of The OJiJi Purple Project, a Bristol based non-profit that campaigns for equality, focusing on working with black women and girls through everyday activism, connecting communities and creativity. She is the curator of Bristol’s first Black Girls
Convention.

As a confident, black woman, who has overcome a lifetime of adversity and personal experiences of injustice, she has carved out a role for herself as a creative activist, working  tirelessly to support the political, social and economic equality of black people and women. She is passionate about social change, the development of people, values-based leadership and creating powerful learning experiences. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The Milwaukee-area senior recently committed to play college basketball for Coach Calipari at Kentucky. 
After picking up a tough loss versus Chicago Orr (#1 in Chicago), Whitnall returned home to face Milwaukee Destiny. 
The gym was packed. We learned that Destiny players had been talking trash on Facebook. The 1-0 Destiny squad had 2-3 defenders on Herro all night. At one point Herro crossed up 2 defenders at once making them collide. He also scored on 3 defenders. 
In the end Tyler Herro scored 42 points (according to the scorer's table) in the 69-63 win for Whitnall (now 1-1).

It was supposed to be the end of his struggle — like tens of thousands of immigrants who have fled to Canada, Jose believed it would welcome him with open arms. But now, just 10 months later, he's worried he might have made a huge mistake.

VICE News traveled to Canada, where Jose and more than 20,000 people are learning that the country isn't quite as welcoming as they thought, and government officials are being dispatched to the United States to clear up the misunderstanding before another 20,000 show up.

SUMMARY
- Scientists found a link between left-handedness and a notion called “divergent thinking”, which is a kind of creativity that allows someone to generate new ideas. 
- People who tend to worry a lot take the quality of their work more seriously. 
- Humor influences intellect by exercising the brain and keeping it in tip-top shape. Next time your friends tell you to quit clowning around, just tell them you are exercising your intellect! 
- Curiosity and an inquisitive mind make people more intelligent. Scientists had been observing 6,000 people born in the last 50 years, and they found that preteen children who had got the most points on IQ tests grew up to be more curious and open-minded adults. 
- Scientists say that this preference for late hours could be due to the fact that brain activity (therefore, intellect) is so high that it challenges your body’s circadian rhythm.
- The harder it is for a person to stay focused, the cleverer they are. How so? Again, it’s that intense brain activity. It’s just too hard to control. 
- People who live in cities built with a focus on walking have a higher intelligence indicator than those living in cities with lots of cars and other types of transport. 
- The less bright a person is, the more they overestimate their cognitive abilities. The same goes the other way around. Intelligent people aren't afraid to say, “I don't know”, and if they don't know, they can find this thing out later. 
- Intelligent people are able to overcome their impulses and suppress their emotions. They also typically think about the consequences before they do something. 
- Scientists agree that intelligent people tend to postpone their tasks for later. Psychologist Adam Grant says that procrastination is the key to innovation. Steve Jobs managed to use his procrastination strategically, letting his brain rest and switching to completely different tasks before finishing the ones he had started.

Welcome to the best tacos in the world - the ultimate guide to Mexican street food tacos in Mexico City!

I met up with Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha (https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo), he’s from Mexico City, he makes videos about street food as well. And he took me to his favorite tacos in all of Mexico City. We each ate the most tacos in one single day that we’d ever eaten in our lives, and it was the greatest taco day of my life!

Here are all the places we ate in this video:

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharrón taco with chicharrón salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo’s favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los Güeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that’s juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

1) Matt Reeves Has Been Meeting with Actors for ‘The Batman’ 

2) ‘X-Men’ Universe May Add James Franco as Multiple Man

3) Comcast Also Interested In Acquiring 21st Century Fox

4) First trailer released for Rampage starring Dwayne Johnson

5) First trailer released for ‘A Quiet Place’ starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski 

6) Mail Bag 

7) Live Twitter Questions

After a report broke saying that Jake Gyllenhaal was the top pick for Matt Reeves’ The Batman should Ben Affleck move on post Justice League, Collider’s own Steve Weintraub spoke to his sources claiming that he is not the front runner, rather, one of many actors that met with Reeves about the part. The source for Collider stresses that it is too early in the process and that Warner Bros doesn’t even have a short-list of actors for the role at this point. 

According to THR, James Franco is in negotiations to play Multiple Man in a stand-alone X-Men spin-off movie being developed by X-Men: Dark Phoenix director and producer Simon Kinberg. The movie will center on Jamie Madrox, also known as Multiple Man, who has the mutant power to create and control duplicates of himself. 

BUY OR SELL

Earlier this month, reports emerged that Disney was in preliminary talks to purchase movie and tv properties from 21st Century Fox but soon after, talks seemed to stall and we haven’t heard much since. Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, it looks as though Comcast has also expressed interest in the media company. 

Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema have released the first trailer for Rampage, Dwayne Johnson‘s latest film that reteams him with his San Andreas director Brad Peyton. Inspired by the 1980s video game, Rampage stars Johnson as a primatologist who shares a close bond with George, a remarkably intelligent silverback gorilla, until a rogue genetic experiment transforms the ape into a gigantic, raging monster. Rampage also stars Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Joe Manganiello and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The film is slated to hit theaters on April 20, 2018. 

Paramount has released the first trailer for A Quiet Place starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski. The film follows a family in the woods who have to live in silence less they summon an evil threat sensitive to sound. Krasinski directs the movie as well, which has a release date set for April 6, 2018.

In 2008, MGMT was on top of the world. Their music was basically the official soundtrack to every house party, and you couldn’t enter an Urban Outfitters without hearing their platinum single, “Kids”.

Their rising star seemed to take a sharp left turn, though, when their second album found them turning toward a sound that was much more psychedelic and much less accessible. MGMT soon got a reputation as a band that had turned their back on fame.

But their most recent single, “Me and Michael,” is a lot more radio-friendly, and it looks like MGMT might be edging, slowly, back toward the mainstream. VICE News visited the band on the set of their music video shoot to find out how, or if, the band plans to reinvent themselves.

CATS WITH ATTITUDES!

Sparta - from viral hit ""The Mean Kitty Song"" which now has over 80 million views to date.  He's a Bengal mix, born sometime in mid-2007; I celebrate his b-day on May 20th.  He rescued me in July of 2007.  Sparta love stalking, wrestling, crunchy toys, playing fetch and being held like a baby.

Loki - the long white kitty that looks like a cow but I believe he may be part monkey. Loki is about the same age as Sparta, so we celebrate their birthdays together. He found me at a rescue center in July of 2008. He loves toys, making noise, hanging upside down, poking things and more than anything, he loves the love!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ORP4KRPdhw4/sddefault.jpg,0.015501474075292876,0.0015378248646122925,10.080129689671145,0.003670408303541983,0.017039298939905162,0.02070970724344715,2018-05-23,17:11:30,Wednesday,2,15,65,14,42,83,460,2,82,0,0,13,3,2,11,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.860257776978084,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'cat': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Lyrics:
NUMB

When all is said and done
Tell me how to write this
Tell me how to fight this war
I’ll keep marching on
Like a broken robot
Money back guarantee
 

I’m in your custody
But I am not a criminal
I can be your next big thing
Look at what I’ve become
Silly little monster, should have just held my tongue
 

I hate the feeling like this
Up on my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me
But nothing really matters
If you force it, it won’t come
 

I guess I’m feeling numb
I guess I’m feeling numb


Sometimes I wish I could fly
Through a secret trapped door
Into another life
Bury my head in the sand
I don’t want to grow up
La la la la la

 
I hate the feeling like this
Up on my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me
But nothing really matters
If you force it, it won’t come


I guess I’m feeling numb
I guess I’m feeling numb


I’ll play the game
I’ll do everything you tell me
All the losers win in the end
 

I hate the feeling like this
Up on my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me
But nothing really matters
If you force it, it won’t come
 

I guess I’m feeling numb
I guess I’m feeling numb",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ORaln6aPqUk/sddefault.jpg,0.017051791902057713,0.00036631903412171163,46.54901960784314,0.0007377685869286013,0.017418110936179426,0.018155879523108032,2018-05-21,16:43:04,Monday,0,6,28,6,27,33,185,3,43,0,0,5,8,0,5,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.3379871161777865,7,"['neutral', 'neutral', 'angry', 'sad', 'happy', 'angry', 'happy']",2,0,0,2,1,0,2,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 10}",11

Watch the Fast Food Calorie Challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJv9Lujp0Qc

Hi Everyone! It is HERE! After years of doing INSANE eating challenges on YouTube, I decided to do the unthinkable. 100,000 CALORIES in 100 HOURS! Doughnuts, Nutella, Pizza, Peanut Butter, Chocolate... every food group makes an appearance in this video! 

Lots of questions will certainly be asked from this video. Meal Structuring, How much weight was gained, the cost of the entire challenge, etc. But that will all be addressed if the video get 50,000+ likes in the ""aftermath video"".

Also, to everyone that continuously throws the ""Why is this so edited"" comment out every time a calorie challenge is uploaded. Let me remind you, this was 100 HOURS of footage. There's no actual way to condense it down anymore than I did. If anyone needs any ""proof"" for my stomach capacity, you can check out the plethora of restaurant challenges and videos that I have on my channel and in my ""restaurant challenges"" playlist on my channel. 

Sit back and watch this epic challenge folks!

short answer: Yes!

Bitcoin arrived eight years ago, and has now spawned a dazzling array of follow-on technologies, including smart contracts, censorship-resistant computation, trustless databases (“blockchains”) and more. This talk attempts to highlight a few of the most significant developments in both technology and in society's response to it, including some nation-state governments banning cryptocurrencies and/or launching their own cryptocurrencies.

This talk will briefly summarize in broad strokes what previously-impossible technologies have now been proven and deployed (starting with Bitcoin), as well as the general outlines of nascent technologies are currently under development. It will also briefly outline the evolution of the market and the social response to these technologies, such as the ICO boom and the varying reactions of different populations and governments. It will also draw out a few examples that illustrate the situation in more detail, such as the recent crackdown by the Chinese government, the deployment and evolution of Ethereum, and the massive investment into new technologies which is being fueled by the ICO boom.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Today I share a change of perspective to let go and gain control of your emotions. I share something I have been working on, I still fail sometimes and feed into the negativity but I am actively trying to better myself on this everyday and become less judgemental of others. Trying is the most important thing. If you are actively trying to be less judgement and feed into negativity then you are doing amazing things and are on the right path.

There are very important topics to campaign for and express you opinion especially when it comes to things such as human rights but getting upset of things a silly as Instagram are not worth your energy.

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. 

While her song ""Devil Devil"" hit success, it wasn't until her anthem ""Quiet"" made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. 

With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OWY4SHxqPh4/sddefault.jpg,0.04073838319541693,0.0005304476978569913,76.8,0.003500954805856143,0.041268830893273926,0.044769785699130066,2018-06-05,20:28:00,Tuesday,1,11,85,11,58,57,509,4,85,2,5,7,12,5,26,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.574106596246164,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"{'cell phone': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Description:

If you’ve ever wondered whether the stars are aligned for you and your partner or crush, then our video on star sign compatibility will help reveal the zodiac signs that most definitely don’t work well together. But as we all know, the path of true love never did run smooth. These are 10 zodiac combinations you should stay away from, but won't.
 
Whether you’re interested in the compatibility of the fire signs Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, the earth signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, the air signs Aquarius, Gemini and Libra, or the water signs Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio, we’ve got it all here.
 
There are certain incompatible zodiac signs that don’t work because they’re just too similar. Like the signs that are so stubborn neither one of them will ever back down. Or the signs that are too strong-willed and clash with other intense signs. Then there are the bad zodiac combinations that don’t work because they’re opposites. Like the critical, practical perfectionists who clash with the easygoing, indecisive dreamers.
 
Of course, all relationships take work, and any couple can have a positive influence on each other regardless of their zodiac sign. It’s just helpful to learn the areas that could be problematic between the two of you, so that you can work through issues together.
 
Watch our video to learn just how hard you and your other half are going to have to work to make it work, and let us know in comments how your current relationship stacks up!

I was wrong when dismissed the Helmet in the show as not correct. It was actually based on a real existing kind of helmet called the Illyrian. I still think I was right in saying the helmet wasn't appropriate for Achillis because it would still be out of place in terms of dates, and because it would still be too open considering Homer actually describes Achilles as being very covered in armour and also because he tells us he loans his armour to his friend Patroclus with the intention of hiding his identity through the helmet, so it had to be closed. Still if you want to know more about the actual helmet check out Schola Gladiatoria's video response to me

LYRICS:

Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight and my heart grew light
And this whole world seemed new to me
You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me
Bei mir bist do schoen, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schoen means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schoen, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land
I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schoen
So kiss me and say you understand
Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schoen means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schoen, it's such an old refrain
and yet I'll say it again
It means I am begging for your hand
I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say that you will understand X3",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OZHzDwK18sQ/sddefault.jpg,0.026167609458617614,0.0003899845126082915,67.09909909909909,0.0044143348293718965,0.026557593971225903,0.0309719288005978,2018-04-02,19:09:54,Monday,0,10,37,10,36,57,309,3,77,0,0,10,21,0,1,5.0,7.0,"['“BEI MiR BiST DU SCHOEN”', '', 'a aa', 'ee']","['“BEI', 'MiR', 'BiST', 'DU', 'SCHOEN”', 'a', 'aa', 'ee']",True,"['“', 'bei', 'mir', 'bist', 'DU', 'schoen', '”', 'a', 'aa', 'ee']",10,10,25,0,1,0,1,2.918504858832016,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'sports ball': 1},1

Welcome to the mom club, Khloe Kardashian! The 33-year-old reality star and Tristan Thompson, 27, officially became parents together on April 12, according to TMZ, and we are BEYOND thrilled for the couple! Sadly, the baby’s entrance into the world couldn’t have come at a more awkward time — just days ago, Tristan was accused of cheating on Khloe with multiple woman on various occasions. It’s no secret that Khloe has been wanting to have a baby for years now, but we only wish she could have gotten her fairytale romance to go along with it.

Harry, 33, was caught on camera as he whispered a few words in his fiancée's ear, eliciting a coy smile in response.
The couple, who were delayed in their visit due to a problem with the trains, greeted well-wishers outside the castle before making their way inside for a 90-minute stay.

We’re breaking down 6 highlights from the Winter Olympic Opening Ceremony...

If you missed the opening ceremony, then you missed the return of Gangnam style.

The Winter Olympics take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea this year, and there were a number of epic moments from the opening ceremony. One highlight was when the US Team walked out to the 2012 hit, Gangnam Style, during the Parade of Nations.

One person commented on Twitter QUOTE, “That the USA just got to walk in to “Gangnam Style” is making my morning.” While another wrote QUOTE, “When you're watching the #Olympics and you hear Gangnam style and you just....stand up and start to dance”.

Thanks for bringing back a classic, Olympics! Psy’s Gangnam Style isn’t the only K-Pop song that was celebrated during the ceremony. Many other K-Pop songs were played during the ceremony, including hits from Twice, Red Velvet, and BTS.

Though it was disappointing that BTS didn’t play live at the ceremony, their fan ARMY definitely approved of DNA being played.

One early breakout moment that the internet was instantly obsessed with was when a random kid went up to an NBC camera that was shooting b-roll, and licked it.

Congrats, kid, you are an official Olympic meme, which is basically like winning the gold medal of the internet. One Twitter user wrote QUOTE, “I really relate to this kid who wanted to know what a camera tasted like. Now he has that information and the rest of us don't.”

He makes an excellent point. Don’t worry I’m not gonna lick this camera, you guys...but don’t think I’m not thinking about it...

One incredibly moving highlight from the ceremony was when four K-pop singers performed an inspiring cover of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" after of the Parade of Nations. Candles formed in the shape of a dove in the middle of the stadium, and the song served as a beautiful call for peace and unity.

Another memorable moment came when Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un impersonators were spotted walking together through the stadium.

Now that’s definitely something we didn’t expect to see.

And last but definitely not least of our favorite moments from the ceremony, was when the Tongan flag-bearer showed off his has amazing abs, and walked through the stadium shirtless.

BRB guys, I’m moving to Tonga!

So what was your guys’ favorite thing from the opening ceremony? Sound off with all the things you loved in the comments, and after that click right over here to check out things you didn't know about BTS. Thanks so much for watching, and be sure to subscribe for more News Feed. I’m Zoe Lillian and I’ll see you soon!

Now way back during the
middle of 2017, we got confirmation on a creature like this appearing in the next Jurassic Park film, after Universal filed copyright patents for its intriguing name. & Of course the FIRST time we were teased with its 
reveal was towards the end of Jurassic World, where Vic Hoskins gives his before-defeat monologue on the military advantages of having a creature like the Indominus Rex, but only a fraction of the size. The Indoraptor
has long been speculated to have within its DNA all of the impressive traits of its former model. Whether this is true or not, we should all acknowledge the fact that the Indominus Rex was given these varying abilities
to specifically help it in any sort of battlefield situation. Its ability to camouflage its body in order to hide against its surroundings and its ability to regulate its body temperature are more than likely traits 
that will be passed down to this newer dino that Henry Wu has carefully created. We also need to consider its intelligence, which might even get an increase in the future film. Dropping the Rex moniker and instead 
using the Raptor part of its code as its new name, suggests that this creature will have its base genome be that of Velociraptor instead of the Indominus usage of the Tyrannosaurus. Which could open up a whole new 
wave of possibilities to its application on-screen. The Indominus Rex in Jurassic World also had the ability to sense thermal radiation, similar to snakes, which is another trait that I highly doubt will get cut from
its genetic code in the new film. Now with all of these modificiations being given to an already dangerous Velociraptor, I think its safe to say that the Indoraptor is probably going to cause quite a few problems for
our characters somewhere in the film.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oad4GVYls9s/sddefault.jpg,0.019631428010711504,0.00025955773893556003,75.63414634146342,0.0051341786896765655,0.019890985749647063,0.025025164439323632,2018-01-25,23:39:22,Thursday,3,11,60,11,20,72,519,0,49,0,0,11,56,4,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.840556147236844,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'elephant': 1},1

A letter that was never meant to be seen, a lie that was never meant to be told, a life he never dreamed he could have. Evan Hansen is about to get the one thing he’s always wanted: a chance to finally fit in.

Both deeply personal and profoundly contemporary, DEAR EVAN HANSEN is a new American musical about life and the way we live it.

We Reviewed all of the songs of course. It was a 7 Track album so it was only 24 minutes of a listen. We reviewed  I Thought about killing you, Yikes, All Mine, Wouldn't Leave, No Mistakes,  Ghost Town, and Violent Crimes.

Supposedly this album is about a Bipolar Yeezus/Ye and his self-being.

It's shallowly subversive and self-aware, mocking its predecessor to be ""Bold,"" while offering little in return. I rant, yell, and review it for 30 minutes to achieve some fun catharsis, but I also understand why critics and fans love it. Hopefully, we'll find common ground.

I instantly felt it was the worst Star Wars film, but maybe I'll look back on this video as overly harsh. Judging how split the fan reactions have been, compared to the critics, I'm not alone in my thoughts! The Last Jedi already has a lot of backlash, but I need to vent!

Rian Johnson, please, don't take this personally... There are calm compliments in the review.

Every time I go into the store I see people do the MOST with the testers and I would never even touch them tbh. I was actually shocked at my pink eye invulnerability while filming this video LOL but seriously I took as many precautions as I could and was cleaning using the alcohol to sterilize each product.  I don't recommend using the eye products, but hey ANYTHING 4 VIEWS! This is the last big makeup store in america, but i was trying to think of where else i could get ready using testers! any suggestions??

How have films engaged the problem of other minds? In this video essay, I discuss cinematic explorations into consciousness in the context of the cognitive revolution that has challenged many of the basic assumptions about what was for a long time believed to be a uniquely human trait.

Marvel finally released a trailer for Avengers Infinity War, with Thanos vs Iron Man, Spider-man, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Panther, Black Widow, and the other Avengers. Erik Voss explains all the interesting, missable details and clues in this trailer. What is the planet we see in the opening shot? Where is the SOUL STONE (the final Infinity Stone)? Who are Thanos' henchmen and what are the creatures in his army? Why does Vision take a human form? And how does Spider-man's new Tony Stark-designed suit work?

Following is a transcript of the video:

Ian Bremmer: Trump has changed his tone on Russia.

Nikki Haley is someone with a long political future and she's very aware of that. She is not someone that is about to sit and kowtow, we've seen that on her statements on Russia consistently since she's become UN Ambassador. There's no question that she's been probably the most hawkish of the major Trump advisors on Russia from day one, when a lot of people have been criticizing Trump for being unwilling to go after Putin individually.

Trump has changed his tone on Russia. He has become harder-lined, he has supported putting very significant sanctions against major Russian oligarchs, which is putting a serious crimp on the Russian economy, much worse than what we saw from the Europeans, that was Trump directly supporting those sanctions.

But we've also seen Trump still angry about the idea of getting rid of 60 Russian diplomats and doing more than individual European countries, even though the U.S. is bigger. We've seen Trump being much more upset about, most recently with Nikki Haley, when she says, we're definitely putting more sanctions on, and he overturns her.

So, there's something about the Trump/Putin relationship, at least in Trump's mind, that makes him not want to take him on in the same way that pretty much everyone in congress, and many of those in his own administration want him to. It's unusual, particularly because Trump usually doesn't care about offending people. Like if someone annoys him or does something bad to him he is the first one to hang up the phone, we saw that with the Australian Prime Minister for example. He's the first one to insult and offend directly in a meeting, we've seen that with a host of leaders, the Mexicans, for example, many of the Europeans.

This is not something that upsets Trump personally, so it's a little unusual, and because it's Nikki Haley, who sees herself not just as a Trump person but, you know, former governor, someone that certainly is thinking about higher positions in the future, she's thinking about her own brand, more than she's thinking about her brand vis-a-vis Trump. And, obviously if she gets in a lot of headlines that is, that makes her a little more vulnerable in terms of Trump's own decision to keep her or not, but at the end of the day, everyone in the Trump administration has a half-life that seems to be a little smaller, a little shorter than that of other administrations we've ever seen. So whether she thinks she can really last for four years or eight, I think is an open question.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Of7k-PSzOUY/sddefault.jpg,0.010192081536652292,0.002822422579380636,3.611111111111111,0.0067032536260290074,0.013014504116032928,0.01971775774206193,2018-04-20,15:00:04,Friday,4,8,21,8,21,45,187,0,37,0,2,8,7,3,0,5.0,8.0,"['TRUMP & RUSSIA', 'VS.

This a solar powered stirling engine that uses a fresnel lens to concantrate the sun and produce power. Unfortunately the lens is sosmall that it can't produce any useful amounts of electricity, so it's just for demonstrating purposes.

The term is most commonly used to refer to meats coated with flour, beaten eggs and bread crumbs, and then fried, but some variants such as Walliser Schnitzel are not breaded. Originating in Austria, the breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and made using either veal, mutton, chicken, beef, turkey, reindeer, or pork. It is very similar to the French dish escalope, and the milanesa of Uruguay and Argentina.

Across the planet, humans eat on average between 1 and 2.7 kilograms of food a day, and every last scrap makes its way through the digestive system. Comprised of ten organs covering nine meters, this is one of the most complicated systems in the body. Emma Bryce explains how the different parts of the digestive system work to transform your food into the nutrients and energy that keep you alive.

OgBai7nR5E4,8J2q99ApzGs,Stranger Things Plans To Kill Off THIS Main Character With This CRAZY Theory,Clevver News,24.0,2017-12-19 18:30:20+00:00,"['News', 'newsfeed', 'clevver news', 'entertainment', 'finn wolfhard', 'stranger things', 'IT', 'finn wolfhard IT', 'finn wolfhard stranger things', 'stranger things 3', 'finn wolfhard turning']",127271.0,3714.0,213.0,1272.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OgBai7nR5E4/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

Is Finn Wolfhard, aka Mike, getting killed OFF in the next season of Stranger Things? There’s one theory going around that’s predicting just that...

This is one fan theory we do NOT wanna get behind. 

When it comes to fan theories about main characters getting killed off, predictions are usually based on clues or foreshadowing within previous seasons of the show in question. But a new theory about Mike being killed off in Stranger Things is less about the character’s storyline, and more about actor Finn Wolfhard’s upcoming schedule.

Finn has played beloved main character Mike Wheeler in Stranger Things for the past two seasons, and while his story arc and character development grew and deepened in the past season, some fans are worried that his part is going to be cut exponentially in seasons to come. This fear comes from the fact that in real life, Finn has a very busy filming schedule ahead of him. Finn starred in this years “It” reboot, and is signed on to appear in the sequel, which is scheduled to be released September 6th, 2019. That means Finn will be shooting scenes for that film in 2018, in addition to another horror film he just signed on to star in, called The Turning. 

And if you’re like, okay okay that’s quite a lot but he could STILL fulfill his obligations as a main character in Stranger Things 3 next year, that’s not all Finn has on his plate in 2018. According to Finn’s IMDB page, he's also attached to a few other upcoming projects, including the Carmen Sandiego reboot. 

Netflix officially confirmed that a Stranger Things 3 would be happening on December 1st, which means the series will undoubtedly be shooting episodes sometime next year. But with all of Finn’s other obligations, what does this mean for Mike? Well, when we look back on how brutal the show has been with some of its previous character deaths #JusticeForBarb #JusticeForBob #JusticeForMewMew, it wouldn’t be COMPLETELY out of the question for the writers to plot out a way for Mike to sacrifice himself to save his friends and/or his beloved Eleven. Now that is NOT the kind of plot twist we would be able to handle, but if it’s the only way for Finn to continue to let his flourishing career flourish--we should at least prepare ourselves for the very worst. 

All that being said, PLEASE let this be just another insanely wild theory that never turns into reality. There’s no way we can handle losing another sweet, innocent character on Stranger Things, and yes I am 100% including #1 Mom Steve Harrington in that statement. 

Alright guys now I wanna hear your thoughts on this theory--would that plot twist immediately turn your world UPSIDE DOWN, or do you think it could potentially make sense for the show?

But how is he with spicy food? Find out as the 19-year-old pop phenom reps his Canadian roots while taking on the wings of death. Along the scorched road, Mendes addresses everything from Justin Bieber's hockey skills, to guitar-store etiquette, to what he can sing about on his forthcoming album that he could never sing about before. Have we seen a bigger physical transformation from a guest in the hot seat since Martin Garrix? You be the judge.

Highlights from the #RoyalWedding.

""Imagine a world where love is the way.""

American Bishop Michael Curry has captured the world's attention with a long and powerful address at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

The Chicago-born bishop spoke passionately about the power of love, quoting Dr Martin Luther King Jr.

""There's power in love, don't underestimate it,"" he said. The wide-ranging and colourful speech was seen as a significant break from tradition.

The Most Reverend Michael Curry became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church - like the Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion - when he was appointed in 2015.

He has spoken out on social justice issues in the past, including LGBT rights and sexual abuse.

The address, replete with historical references, had churchgoers, including David Beckham and the Duchess of Cornwall smiling. Others appeared transfixed.

The bride and groom, who invited Bishop Curry to speak, sat near the preacher and held hands as they watched him speak.

SONG: Have It All
ARTISTS: Jason Mraz
ALBUM: Have It All

▼LYRICS▼

[Verse 1]
May you have our auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May you take no effort and you'll be no generous
Sharing what you can, nothing more nothing less

May you know the meaning of the word happiness
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest, may you catch your breath

[Pre-Chorus]
I made the best to yours todays
Be the worst to your tommorows
Woah, I made the role, let's play
Be the role that you follow
Woah

[Chorus]
Well, here's to the hearts that you gonna break
Here's to the lies that you gonna change
Here's to the infinite, possible ways to love you
I want you to have it

Here's to the good times we gonna have
You don’t need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I want you to have it all
I want you to have it (all)
I want you to have it all

[Verse 2]
May you be as fascinating as the slap bracelet
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
Having no possessions through immeasurable wealth

May you get your gold star on your next test
May your educated guesses always be correct
And may you win prizes, shining like diamonds
May you really only reach only moment to the next

And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows (woah)
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow (woah)


[Chorus]
Well, here's to the hearts that you gonna break
Here's to the lies that you gonna change
Here's to the infinite, possible ways to love you
I want you to have it

Here's to the good times we gonna have
You don’t need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I want you to have it all
I want you to have it (all)
I want you to have it all

[Bridge]
Oh, I want you to have it all
All you can imagine, oh
No matter what your path is
If you believe it, then anything could happen
Go go go, raise your glasses
Go go go, you can have it
Oh

[Chorus]
I told you here's to the hearts that you gonna break
Here's to the lies that you gonna change
Here's to the excellence, possible ways
To love you, I want you to have it
Here's to the good times we gonna have
You don’t need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I want you to have it all
I want you to have it (all)
I want you to have it all
I want you to have it

Here's to the good times we gonna have
(I want you to have it all)
Here's to your voice making me laugh
(I want you to have it all)
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
(I want you to have it all)

I want you to have it all

In 2016, Alexandr Dmitriev and his wife, Mariya, decided to adopt a young cougar called Messi and raise him as a house-pet in their small, studio apartment in Penza, Russia. Messi follows a strict grooming routine to ensure he doesn’t make too much of a mess around the house – he gets washed in the bath, has his nails trimmed, his teeth checked and he receives a special brush-down every day. The big cat eats twice a day with a diet consisting of turkey, beef, a bit of chicken breast and some bones. And with a growing social media following of 250,000 on Instagram and more than 2 million views on YouTube, Messi has become a local celebrity.

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Most history books will tell you that the Roman Empire fell in the fifth century CE, but this would’ve come as a surprise to the millions who lived in the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages. This Medieval Roman Empire, today called the Byzantine Empire, began when Constantine, the first Christian emperor, moved Rome's capital. Leonora Neville details the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire.

Lesson by Leonora Neville, animation by Remus & Kiki.

‘4월 16일 컴백’ The Rose(더 로즈) 첫 미니 앨범 ‘Void’ 발매
The Rose(더 로즈) 첫 미니 앨범 타이틀 곡 ‘BABY’ 
사랑이 가져다 준 공허함 ‘BABY’

The Rose(더 로즈)가 첫 미니 앨범 ‘Void’로 컴백한다. 
선보이는 곡마다 새로운 매력을 보여주며 발전해 온 더 로즈의 이번 미니 앨범 'Void'는 곡의 작사, 작곡, 편곡 뿐만아니라 연주까지 멤버 모두 참여한 곡들로 이루어진 앨범으로 더 로즈만의 음악적 색을 더욱 부각시키며 진정한 밴드로서의 면모를 보여줄 예정이다. 
'The Rose(더 로즈)'는 우성(일렉 기타/메인보컬), 도준(피아노, 어쿠스틱 기타/메인보컬), 재형(베이스), 하준(드럼)으로 구성된 4인조 밴드 그룹이다.
이번 앨범은 이전에 싱글로 공개되었던 ‘sorry’, ‘좋았는데(Like We Used To)’를 비롯하여 ‘BABY’, ‘Candy (so good)’, ‘I.L.Y.’와 INST버전까지 총 8곡으로 구성되었다. 특히, 타이틀곡인 ‘BABY’는 이전 단독 콘서트를 통해 처음 선보인 후 음원 발매에 대한 요청이 끊이지 않았던 곡으로 사랑이 식어버린 연인을 떠나 보낼 수 밖에 없는 남자의 내적 분노와 슬픔을 표현한 곡의 곡이다.

지난 2월, 데뷔 6개월 만에 벨기에, 영국, 헝가리 등 유럽 5개국 투어 공연인 '2018 패인트 잇 로즈 투어 인 유럽’(2018 PAINT IT ROSE TOUR IN EUROPE)을 성황리에 마친 The Rose(더 로즈)는 이후 북미 7개, 남미 2개국 4개 도시, 호주 2개 도시, 유럽 6개국으로 이뤄지는 월드 투어의 일환으로 5월 12일, 13일 양일간 The Rose(더 로즈)의 시그니처 콘서트인 국내 공연 ‘더 로즈 데이(The Rose Day)’ 를 열어 국내 팬들을 만날 계획이다.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OoHiiyPSfPY/sddefault.jpg,0.016065119274875958,0.00017969409996592813,89.40259740259741,0.0007257774686935537,0.016244813374841894,0.016970590843535447,2018-03-22,08:35:01,Thursday,3,8,37,8,32,49,328,0,76,0,1,7,16,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.039786315541389,3,"['happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,3,0,0,0,"{'couch': 1, 'person': 4}",5

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. 

When the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.

With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. 

Stars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. 

Directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer.

In celebration of Erik Satie's birthday (May 17, 1866), I wrote a version of ""Happy Birthday"" imitating his musical style and I outline some tips on how to sound like Erik Satie.  These obviously just cover the surface layer of Satie's music -- I am in no way trying to diminish his musical depth with this type of analysis or breakdown.  Think of it as a sort of how-to ""hack"" tutorial on playing or writing something in a style reminiscent of Satie's music.

The reality, as is often the case, is more complicated than that. White blood cells actually refer to a whole family of cells that all make up the different parts of your immune system. One of the main soldiers in your immune systems army are T cells which recognize foreign bodies and destroy them.

In some of the newest cancer therapies scientists are using genetic engineering to teach a patients own T cells how to find cancer cells so that they can be destroyed. This way only cancer cells are damaged and the rest of the body remains healthy, unlike in traditional chemotherapy and radiation.

Over the past several months I've been in Florida visiting my friend Gabriel Licina and his mammalian cell culture lab. While there I got to film the process of extracting T cells from whole blood which uses some incredible biochemistry to make possible.

The legendary Super Mario World was of course the pack-in game, but the only other games on the shelf that day were Pilotwings and F-Zero.  While Sega would latch on to the fact that, having released two years prior, the Genesis had a much larger library, several games were released on the Super Nintendo in 1991 that have come to be considered absolute classics on the system.  Gradius III, one of the best shooters on the console, came out about a week after launch, and other noteworthy titles released that year include ActRaiser, Final Fantasy II, Super Ghouls'n Ghosts, and Super Castlevania IV.

Show Notes:

- That is veteran character actor “Mike Starr” in the SNES commercial at the beginning of the video.

- This is the longest ""documentary"" style episode I've ever made, at just over 1 hour long.

- The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was originally announced as an Autumn 1991 release, but the game was delayed until early 1992.

- Work began on this video in June of 2017, and the episode was finished 10 minutes before midnight on December 31st.

- All gameplay footage was captured using an RGB-modded model 2 Super Nintendo upscaled through a Framemeister and recorded using an Elgato Game Capture HD.

As the seemingly unstoppable Nazi forces advance, and with the Allied army cornered on the beaches of Dunkirk, the fate of Western Europe hangs on the leadership of the newly-appointed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman).  While maneuvering his political rivals, he must confront the ultimate choice: negotiate with Hitler and save the British people at a terrible cost or rally the nation and fight on against incredible odds.  Directed by Joe Wright, DARKEST HOUR is the dramatic and inspiring story of four weeks in 1940 during which Churchill’s courage to lead changed the course of world history.

This world will never stop surprising us, just take a look for yourself!
Scientists have recently found that the universe tastes like raspberries and the Mona Lisa actually used to have eyebrows.
The coldest place in the Universe isn’t on the Moon, where temperatures can plunge down to minus 378°F. It was recorded in a lab, where scientists in Finland managed to freeze atoms using a laser. If we could get rid of the empty space in atoms, all of humanity would fit into an apple. The biggest living organism in the world is a mushroom. Human lungs have the same surface area as a tennis court.
Whether a man has a son or a daughter can often depend on what kind of siblings he has. You might have heard that a person is usually a bit taller in the morning than they are in the evening. As for the height of the Eiffel Tower, it changes depending on the weather. The cavefish can walk and climb thanks to its tetrapod-like pelvis. It uses its flippers like four-legged land animals use their limbs.
your brain helps you stay fit! Assuming that the average metabolic rate during rest periods is 1,300 calories, your brain takes 260 of them!

The answers to living a long and happy life may come from Japan which has the longest average life expectancy in the world (83.84 years) and where 2 million people are over the age of 90. Believe it or not, 6 of the top 10 oldest people alive are from Japan including Nabi Tajima of Kagoshima who is 117 years old and the last human alive born in the 19th century! 

How did so many Japanese get to live so long? 
What are some of the things Japanese do right? 

In this episode, John travels to Tottori Prefecture to the area around Mt Daisen where his friend Tomiko-san gives him some advice about how to live a long life and how she's lived to be 106 years old and still working on the farm! 

Her secret? 
Tofu. 

She started to make tofu in the 1950s when doctors said residents had to reduce high blood pressure. She made her own tofu for her family and her diet combined with good habits including staying busy and working hard have strengthened her mind and body. She still walks and writes tanka poetry. 

I also ask Mr. Seiichi, my 97 year old Japanese neighbor his secret and hear from a Shinto priest about his thoughts and personal experiences with living a very long and happy life in Japan. 

It's impossible to say exactly what has led to Japan having the longest average life expectancy in the world but these things may help:

★ Green Tea
★ Less fatty foods
★ Seafood
★ Fermented foods
★ Bath culture / Hot Springs & Onsen
★ Smaller portions
★ Education on personal responsibility
★ National safety / low crime rates
★ Respect for the Elderly (It's a national holiday too!)
★ DNA

Special thank you to Daisen Town & Yonago City in Tottori Prefecture for the help. Daisen is celebrating its 1300th anniversary this year and you're invited to the party in June 2018! http://www.daisen1300.org/

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OzeKm_MPxKg/sddefault.jpg,0.013896247971652812,0.0012915190250687154,10.759615384615383,0.0007409676457926284,0.015187766996721528,0.015928734642514156,2018-01-30,06:22:00,Tuesday,1,9,38,9,33,55,334,0,79,0,1,6,14,3,0,5.0,8.0,"['ts)', '‘ es iE °', '', 'ie ef', '', 'ee ae ee', 'ee', '255', 'er', 'Ey', '', 'toni', '', 'Cee']","['ts)', '‘', 'es', 'iE', '°', 'ie', 'ef', 'ee', 'ae', 'ee', 'ee', '255', 'er', 'Ey', 'toni', 'Cee']",True,"['ts', ')', '‘', 'es', 'iE', '°', 'ie', 'ef', 'ee', 'ae', 'ee', 'ee', '255', 'er', 'Ey', 'toni', 'cee']",17,15,35,1,0,1,0,5.946826311387513,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

But when Jeff's family begins to implode, he finds no fairy tale or fable or puppet will guide him through the crisis, which advances faster than his means to cope. The result: a kind man in a cruel world faces a slow leak of sanity as hilarious as it is heartbreaking. Starring Jim Carrey, Frank Langella, Catherine Keener and Judy Greer.

The local government in Ibaraki gave us free reign for three days to film whatever places we wanted, and I happened to stumble upon this cafe through my frantic googling. THANK GOD WE DID because this is legitimately the most beautiful restaurant we've ever seen in our lives!! It's right next to a waterfall (which you can walk under) on a mountainside and there is nothing else nearby. No ugly cities right out of view, just nature and this beautiful soba restaurant! There are a lot of other waterfalls nearby, as well as apple orchards, a river, and some lovely cafes and ryokans. If you get a chance, I recommend stopping by Daigo for a day! It's probably best to rent a car because I'm not sure how accessible most places are by train!

Today we try figure skating with future Kim Yunas! When we started out we thought how hard can it be?! And it turned out, it was REALLY REALLY hard. The little figure skaters calculated how long it would take for Ollie to be a professional figure skater! Find out in the video!!

The Harry Potter series has been a consistent source of magic for more than two decades. But not all of the silver screen adaptations of J.K. Rowling's works have turned out as well as others. From pacing issues to distracting book-to-screen inconsistencies to moments of shoddy direction, some of the films simply don't measure up to the rest. So, let's walk through all of the Harry Potter films, starting with the best and counting down to find out which of them is officially the worst Harry Potter movie ever made...

While the phone looks mostly the same, its interior has been upgraded with all the latest specs to bring users new camera modes, updated Bixby features, and a fingerprint scanner that’s placed... well, where it should have been in the first place. There’s also a new AR Emoji feature that’s supposed to take on Apple’s Animoji by creating a custom, movable emoji based on your face.

Watch all these features, and more, announced in our supercut of the one-hour long event, and be sure to follow The Verge all week as we bring you all the latest from MWC 2018.

Olaf's Frozen Adventure is an upcoming 2017 holiday special based on the characters of the 2013 Walt Disney Animation Studios film, Frozen.

On the first holiday season following Elsa's coronation, the story centers around Olaf's first experience with the holidays. Anna and Elsa have no true understanding of the holidays or seasonal tradition due to their enforced isolation over the years. This prompts Olaf to journey off into Arendelle in search of a holiday tradition for his family to share. Sven also joins the journey as Olaf's ""partner-in-crime"". 

Josh Gad as Olaf
Kristen Bell as Anna
Idina Menzel as Elsa the Snow Queen
Jonathan Groff as Kristoff 

""Olaf's Frozen Adventure"" will be released with Pixar's original film, ""Coco,"" in theaters Nov. 22.

I use this Rice Water to wash my face in the morning and at night, I just splash it on my face a couple times after using my cleanser. I've been using Rice Water as a face wash for almost 3 months now. At first I saw no difference, but after using it consistently, I've seen a massive difference. 

My skin is so much brighter, it doesn't look as dull and it's definitely a lot softer. Rice water is the only thing I use that consistently keeps my skin bright and clear.

This rice water face wash toner is very beneficial for the skin. It is full of minerals and amino acids, including ferulic acid which is a powerful antioxidant that contains anti inflammatory properties. 

In addition to being one of the most gentle skin cleansing agents, rice water contains vitamins B1, C and E, which together can shrink pores, tighten, brighten and soften skin. 

Rice water promotes cell growth, stimulates blood flow in the skin and the starch components in rice water are very effective in easing eczema. 
Also, ancient East Asian women are famous for using rice water in their hair and bathing in it, which is why they had very strong long hair and beautiful, white glowing skin.

Let’s turn off all the lights
Draw the blind and all the curtains
Let’s lose track of the time
i’ll sneak off and you’ll come searching

I’m gonna run, gonna hide, where you’ll never find me (find me)
I’m gonna run, gonna hide, see if you can find me (find me)

So close your eyes, count to ten
Hear the steps, follow them
Through the dark, walls apart
Closing in, hide & seek

Passing by, hold my breath
Hear your steps, circling
Through the dark, walls apart
Closing in, hide & seek

I peek my head outside
Listen try to hear me moving
Too bad I’m out of sight
Catching shadows think you’re losing

I’m gonna run, gonna hide, where you’ll never find me (find me)
I’m gonna run, gonna hide, see if you can find me (find me)

So close your eyes, count to ten
Hear the steps, follow them
Through the dark, walls apart
Closing in, hide & seek

Passing by, hold my breath
Hear your steps, circling
Through the dark, walls apart
Closing in, hide & seek",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P46Wtg4fuAw/sddefault.jpg,0.014939095849432276,0.00038540813392388967,38.761755485893424,0.00045910686799711004,0.015324503983356169,0.01578361085135328,2017-12-03,19:08:39,Sunday,6,11,53,11,39,52,349,5,63,1,1,7,7,1,4,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.402274110191457,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

When we learned of these kittens living in a tree hollow we knew we had to help them! … *I never personally saw the black and white kitten or the momma cat, we were just going off of what we had been told, still no sign of either of them unfortunately.

I may place a camera trap out there to make 100% sure there's no more kittens in the area.

After a few days with Larry, the kittens are in his bathroom now and running around playing with toys, so we won't have a problem finding them homes, 4 more lives saved!

Special thanks to Larry and St Francis Society Animal Rescue for their help: http://www.stfrancisrescue.org

The eighth generation of console gaming has been dominated by the PlayStation 4 ever since its brilliant 2013 launch left Xbox in the dust. Now, Microsoft is doing just fine, but there’s no denying the PS4 has got it beat in terms of sales. In fact, Microsoft is still trying to perform damage control to this day, but as of right now, it seems like the Sony PlayStation 4 has established itself as a multi-purpose entertainment unit boasting an impressive library of games with an amazing mass appeal. The sheer wealth of exclusives the PS4 boasts is nothing to scoff at and makes the meager collection of Microsoft look extremely sparse by comparison. Yeah, the exclusives are that good. From Uncharted to Horizon: Zero Dawn, any true gamer will find something to love that's exclusive to PlayStation.

However, even the most hardcore PlayStation fans may not know the full capabilities of their console. There are some lesser known PS4 features that may have flown under your radar. Trust us when we tell you that the power of the PlayStation console simply shouldn't be underestimated, and we strongly urge you to explore every nook and cranny of your console's settings, so you can enable a degree of functionality the likes of which you’ve never seen before. Of course, doing so might be a bit of a pain, but we’re here to make this journey easier for you so, without further ado, here is TheGamer’s list of 10 Things Only Pro Gamers Know The PS4 Could Do.

The year is 15 CE, and the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the emperor, but this success wouldn’t have been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Robert Garland illuminates what life was like for a solider in the Roman army.

He went on to speak about how he thought Tina was white when he first saw her, but later realized that she was a conscious black woman. 

Moving along, Mathew spoke about Kelly Rowland living with his family for 8 years and also about the racism he witnessed in the music industry, including favoritism toward lighter skinned artists.

Its eyeglass-case chassis evokes the old Sony Tablet P, while its miniature QWERTY keyboard suggests a laptop that stumbled into a shrinking machine. But its closest relative is probably the Psion PDA from the 1990s, a device beloved as much for its powerful scheduling software as for its robust physical keyboard. 

The Planet Gemini is no mere throwback. It’s available in WiFi and 4G versions (for both GSM and CDMA networks), it dual-boots Android and Linux, and you can even make phone calls on it. Planet says the Gemini is meant for bloggers, longform writers and other creators who live and die by a physical keyboard, and it’s easy to see why it’d be a tempting purchase for such folks. Still, it’s hard to envision many people ponying up for a device that slots in somewhere between the smartphone and laptop, yet professes to replace neither. 

Of course, you don’t *need* to imagine it; you can just head on over to Planet’s Indiegogo page (down below) to see how many customers have already devoted their dollars to picking up a Gemini of their own. If you’re keen to join them, the Planet Gemini is available for $299 or $399 in WiFi and 4G versions, respectively, with units already in production. The Planet Gemini ships to early backers later this month; deliveries will continue into the spring, at which point I’ll hopefully follow up with a full review.

So it came as no surprise to see that Matt Smith and Claire Foy (centre) were in chirpy spirits as they walked the red carpet at The Crown premiere held at Leicester Square's Odeon Cinema on Tuesday. Cuddling up together, the stars seemed keen to promote their new Netflix series, but it was the show's corgi (inset) that became the unlikely star of the evening as it followed on behind its human co-stars. The lovebirds were accompanied by actresses Gillian Anderson (right) and Vanessa Kirby (left), who turned heads in their glamorous dresses.

""INTERDIMENSIONAL SUMMIT"" LYRICS

Mired in illusion
Lost in the masters game
Silenced by the idea of time
Nurtured with lies and deceit

The silent seeker, the seer
Travels beyond the veil
The silent seeker, the seer
Fleeing the dense womb of ignorance

To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
The more you see
The less it makes sense
To the trained eye 
There are no coincidences
If you can not see
You can not truly know

We are the current sum of all the ages
Leaving a trail of burnt pages
Thrown into darkness as stars
We travel alone as one

When the dust settles on the tavern
Is when we're liberated from illusion
Taking our first and final breath
Realizing life is always after death",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P7vg7ir8jyc/sddefault.jpg,0.010449711299267408,0.0010103854399783057,10.342301943198805,0.001382085116037423,0.011460096739245713,0.012842181855283135,2018-02-23,14:09:48,Friday,4,8,62,8,61,61,575,3,118,5,0,2,8,0,2,7.0,8.0,['NUCLEAR BLAST.'],"['NUCLEAR', 'BLAST.']",True,"['nuclear', 'blast', '.']",3,3,13,1,0,0,0,6.5791551513182975,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

With this papercraft project you can make 2 geometric looking tails for room decoration. Create your own ocean inspired room decoration, that's easy to install :). The blue metallic paper is looking very modern! This Papercraft project is fun to do and turns you into a paper artist! :) 

What you need to make the whale tails is:
-  Assembli Paper Whale Kit
-  cutting mat
- scissor and exacto knife
- scoring pen /or empty ballpoint pen /or big paperclip /or folding bone /or blunt butter knife

The blue metallic paper slows down the drying proces a bit, so make sure you wait long enough between each tab before proceeding :) The project for both tails takes up a couple of hours, depending on experience. 

This kit can be found over here:
http://assembli.nl/product/paper-whale-kit/

enjoy and hopefully you are inspired to try this project as well :)

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Mark Hunter - Hey John, I saw the last Jedi on opening night and I have to say that I did have a few issues with the movie, BUT overall I loved it! Anyways, I recently saw a review done by ET Canada and the guy just RIPS into the movie. My question to you is this...... is this movie being misunderstood by many Star Wars fans?

Evan - John I’m a huge fan, I love the show! Since we now know Rey’s lineage do you think Rey could take on the Skywalker last name to honor Luke? Since her real last name doesn’t really matter I think it would be a cool way to carry on the Skywalker name. Thanks MTFBWY!

Joseph Lo Re - Hey John! Yesterday, you put up a video saying that the Last Jedi would probably have a 60% drop in its second weekend with one reason being some people not liking the film. However, I see no legitimate evidence of this with Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and CinemaScore being around the same as The Force Awakens. Where are you seeing a huge audience divide if mostly everyone seems to like this as much as The Force Awakens?

Ian Turner - After our heroes resolve the issues of the Empire in the OT we find ourselves in a largely similar situation after TLJ. Am I wrong to worry that if there is an ep 10, 11, 12 then that means whatever problems resolved in 7,8,9 will be reversed again?

Ryan Roper - Hi Jon, big fan of all of your content. Please keep your show as intimate as it is now as your channel grows! My question is simple: Is DJ the same codebreaker that Maz refers to and did he just lose his lapelle pin to the suave character we see at the table. DJ looks more like the kind of guy that would hang around Maz's bar. Thanks and keep up the great work. Thanks, Ryan.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P9kC1jLGZwQ/hqdefault.jpg,0.030449826989619382,0.006228373702422145,4.888888888888889,0.01630449826989619,0.036678200692041515,0.05298269896193772,2017-12-19,23:53:10,Tuesday,1,16,17,13,17,74,133,2,31,0,0,15,17,5,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5702258284558495,4,"['happy', 'angry', 'neutral', 'sad']",1,0,0,1,1,0,1,{'person': 4},4

Als sich Bumblebee im Jahre 1987 auf der Flucht befindet, findet er Zuflucht auf einem Schrottplatz in einer kleinen kalifornischen Stadt. Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) wird bald 18 Jahre alt, sucht ihren Platz in der Welt - und findet stattdessen den ramponierten Bumblebee. Als Charlie ihn wieder auf Vordermann bringt, bemerkt sie schnell, dass es sich hierbei um keinen handelüblichen, gelben VW-Käfer handelt.

PBKa-AAy_vo,NB3gWkhLkxM,Daniel Caesar: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,NPR Music,10.0,2018-06-11 09:00:01+00:00,"['NPR', 'NPR Music', 'National Public Radio', 'Live', 'Performance']",10239057.0,183253.0,1881.0,7033.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PBKa-AAy_vo/default.jpg,"June 4, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- Daniel Caesar and his band had a clear vision for their Tiny Desk performance. While already confined to a small space, they opted to congregate at the piano, where producer and music director Matthew Burnett sat to create what feels like a fly-on-the-wall moment. We're presented a purity that's nearly impossible to capture on an album.

The success of Caesar's debut LP, Freudian, has created a groundswell of fanfare and exposure for the 23-year-old singer-songwriter. It was nominated for two Grammys and won two Junos (Canada's equivalent to the Grammys). We've seen him perform on Late Night with Seth Meyers, pop stars are serenading him with his own songs and his set at this year's Coachella festival was one of the most buzzed about (behind the queen Bey, of course). Caesar's is an organic ascent that's yet to reach its peak.

Caesar carries a coy aura about him, until he opens his mouth to sing. The years of training in church, fused with natural talent, is on full display. Supporting vocalists Camille Harrison, Danah Berry and Nevon Sinclair are in tow for the whole ride, providing some of the richest harmonies we've heard at the Tiny Desk. I found myself fixated on the playful manner in which the band members interacted with each other.

Caesar didn't hold back with the set list. He performed his three most-streamed songs (a combined 249,000,000 plays on Spotify alone), including ""Best Part,"" which included a Tiny Desk guest appearance by NPR Music favorite H.E.R.

Set List

""Japanese Denim""
""Get You""
""Best Part (feat. H.E.R.)""

Here are the funniest, weirdest and most insightful parts of the journey and what it has revealed to him about human nature. Max Joseph is a filmmaker who grew up in New York, lives in Los Angeles, and shoots all over the world. He is perhaps best known as the co-host of the MTV reality TV series entitled “Catfish: The TV Show” which investigates the murkier end of the online dating world. He has written, directed, and produced over 70 short films that have screened at Sundance, Telluride, and SXSW. Max’s short film “Follow the Frog” was featured as one of TED’s Ads Worth Spreading in 2013. He most recently co-wrote and directed the film WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS starring Zac Efron and Emily Ratajkowski. He is also a frequent collaboroter with YouTube filmmaker Casey Neistat.

The eruption of the Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island continues, having now created 19 fissures in the eastern rift zone among housing subdivisions near the island's southeastern corner. One of the newest fissures has been seen tossing ""spatter bombs"" of lava distances of up to 500 feet, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

At least three dozen structures have already been damaged or destroyed by lava from the fissures, which began opening up over ten days ago in the Leilani Estates neighborhood of Puna.

Cenk Uygur, the host of The Young Turks, tells you why he’s resigning. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

“WASHINGTON — The day after he fired James Comey as director of the FBI, a furious President Donald Trump called the bureau's acting director, Andrew McCabe, demanding to know why Comey had been allowed to fly on an FBI plane from Los Angeles back to Washington after he was dismissed, according to multiple people familiar with the phone call.

McCabe told the president he hadn’t been asked to authorize Comey’s flight, but if anyone had asked, he would have approved it, three people familiar with the call recounted to NBC News.

The president was silent for a moment and then turned on McCabe, suggesting he ask his wife how it feels to be a loser — an apparent reference to a failed campaign for state office in Virginia that McCabe’s wife made in 2015.

McCabe replied, “OK, sir.” Trump then hung up the phone.

A White House official, who would not speak on the record, disputed the account, saying, ""this simply never happened. Any suggestion otherwise is pure fiction.” The FBI declined to comment on the call.”

Now, Tony Award-winning director Kenny Leon is laying this question bare in a breathtaking new production of this landmark play starring Joshua Jackson, Lauren Ridloff and Anthony Edwards. Winner of Tony, Drama Desk, and Olivier Awards, ""Children of a Lesser God"" tells the story of an unconventional teacher at a school for the deaf and the remarkable woman he meets there. As their relationship heats up, so does their desire to connect — igniting a thrilling exploration of passion, intimacy, and what we surrender when we fall in love. Jackson, Ridloff and interpreter Candace Broecker-Penn stopped by the BUILD stage to discuss the play.

BUILD is a live interview series like no other—a chance for fans to sit inches away from some of today’s biggest names in entertainment, tech, fashion and business as they share the stories behind their projects and passions. Every conversation yields insights, inspiration and plenty of surprises as moderators and audience members ask questions. It all happens several times a day live and live-streamed on BUILDseries.com.

Death: an unfortunate, inescapable part of life, and it'll eventually come for everyone - even the famous. So, when actors in the middle of filming a hit TV series pass away, the cast, crew, and even audience are frequently left with   friend-shaped hole in their hearts. But the show must go on, right? Here are some of TV's most memorable characters who were written off after the actors playing them passed away. Beware of spoilers, and probably a couple of tears...

With seven main saga installments, an anthology movie, and numerous television releases and animated spinoffs, Star Wars is undoubtedly one of the biggest Hollywood properties ever.

Here's a look back at all the movies that are part of the massive phenomenon that is Star Wars, as we rank them in order from worst to best...
