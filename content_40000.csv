A mechanical braille embosser cost over a 1000$USD and an electronic goes from 3000$ up to 5000$. I tough about making one for a friend but I couldn't find a DIY version, so I decided to make one myself. This isn’t, by any means, a finish product. By making the machine an open source project, I am hoping others will improve the design. In a near future, with the help of others makers, OpenBraille will reduce the cost of these printers and it will allow anyone with a visual imparity to read and write. So, if you know someone, if you are a maker, if you are curious or if you want to help out, please feel free to follow this tutorial and help me built a community around OpenBraille.
The encoder is pretty much the heart of the embosser. Most of the commercial machines emboss the dots by impacting the sheet. Because it’s harder to build a precise machine out of 3D printed parts, I designed a different system. Instead of impacting and applying all the energy in a single hit, OpenBraille uses a physical encoder and a roller. This way, the embossing is gradually done and the parts can be easily printed.

At some point in your life, you’ll have to deal with law enforcement officers, even if you haven't broken any laws. We’ll be answering the most common “What if...” and “Can they...” questions about the police. 
Remember, when dealing with law enforcement officers, stay calm and respectful at all times, never argue with or touch a police officer, and always state out loud if you do not consent.

SUMMARY
-If a police officer stops you on the street, it doesn't always mean they think you’ve committed a crime. Stay polite and answer questions about your name and where you live. If you’re visiting another country, always carry a copy of your ID with you. 
-You have the right to remain silent and will never be punished for not answering a question.
-Police officers don't need any written document forcing you to leave the premises but they cannot order you to move if you’re protesting some political issue or taking part in a strike.
-When pulled over by the police, stay calm and polite, step outside if the officer asks you to and only answer questions in connection with the reason you were pulled over.

The last time Assad visited Russia was at the beginning of the Russian campaign in Syria in 2015. According to the Syrian president, in two years of the Russian campaign the successes achieved have been evident and many residents of the country were able to return to their homes. He noted that thanks to Russia, Syria was saved as a state.

The Chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, Valeri Gerasimov, said conditions have been created for the return of refugees to Syria, during the trilateral meeting with his Turkish and Iranian counterparts in Sochi. ""The main thing is that the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of the country has been preserved, the civil war was stopped, conditions were created for the restoration of peaceful life and refugees' return,"" said Gerasimov.

President Putin similarly told his Czech counterpart, Milos Zeman, that ""over 98% of the territory of Syria is under the control of Syrian government troops, during their meeting in Sochi.  Zeman congratulated Russia for its role in the outcome in Syria, saying: ""you have won in Syria, because he [Assad] now controls almost the entire Syrian territory.""

Fair Use
Additionally, the fair use defense to copyright infringement was codified for the first time in section 107 of the 1976 Act. Fair use was not a novel proposition in 1976, however, as federal courts had been using a common law form of the doctrine since the 1840s (an English version of fair use appeared much earlier). The Act codified this common law doctrine with little modification. Under section 107, the fair use of a copyrighted work is not copyright infringement, even if such use technically violates section 106. While fair use explicitly applies to use of copyrighted work for criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research purposes, the defense is not limited to these areas. The Act gives four factors to be considered to determine whether a particular use is a fair use:
the purpose and character of the use (commercial or educational, transformative or reproductive);
the nature of the copyrighted work (fictional or factual, the degree of creativity); 
the amount and substantiality of the portion of the original work used; and
the effect of the use upon the market (or potential market) for the original work.
The Act was later amended to extend the fair use defense to unpublished works.........

The youngest daughter of weapons designer, Torbjörn Lindholm, Brigitte was the first of his children to show an interest in mechanical engineering. Brigitte spent much of her spare time in her father's workshop, learning the trade and honing her skills. Her aptitude for engineering mirrored that of her father's, but Brigitte's primary interest was in armor fabrication and defensive systems, unlike Torbjörn, who was world renowned (and perhaps infamous) for the weapons he created.

Brigitte specializes in armor. She can throw Repair Packs to heal teammates, or automatically heal nearby allies when she damages foes with her Flail. Her Flail is capable of a wide swing to strike multiple targets, or a Whip Shot that stuns an enemy at range. When entering the fray, Barrier Shield provides personal defense while she attacks enemies with Shield Bash. Brigitte’s ultimate ability, Rally, gives her a substantial short-term boost of speed and provides long-lasting armor to all her nearby allies.

i hope our words were comprehensible i'm afraid some things just aren't funny to anybody but us ooooopss....

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Sandeep - Great fan from India. Your show gets me through college. As the year comes to a close what would you say should be Hollywood's biggest lesson learned from 2017? More female directors? Case: WW, Lady Bird, Battle of the Sexes. Or a better use of marketing in films? Case: Blade Runner 2049, JL, War for the Planet of the Apes. Or some other lessons entirely? 

Jessica Montgomery - This year is packed with amazing lead actress performances. If you had to pick right now between Margot Robbie (I, Tonya), Emma Stone (Battle Of The Sexes), Frances McDormand (Three Billboards),  Sally Hawkins (The Shape Of Water), Jessica Chastain (Molly’s Game) or Meryl Streep (The Post), who would you give the award to?

PATREON Supporter WIlliam Siggery - Hi John love the show! watching in England every night, I follow the official Star Wars page on Instagram and they have posted a clip counting down the days till the last Jedi (8 days to go!!) At the end it shows ray force grabbing kylo ren's lightsaber!!  this is the first time I've seen this clip, just wondered if you'd seen it and your thoughts.

Connor - Hey, John. Great show. I listen on my walk to work every day. My question is about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom trailer. I found my excitement skyrocket yesterday. What are your thoughts on the renewed focus on animatronics in the film? It has me pumped beyond belief.

PATREON Supporter Dion Sheppard - Hey John, I am wondering what do you think about the confirmation that WB is indeed shaking up the DCEU. Between it starting in January to the dea of further integrating DC’s film operations into the studio’s main movie arm. That would entail putting the divisions under the same roof rather than having DC remain in a separate building on the lot.

Fish skin has been used as a bandage on people, though not in the U.S. Vets had to speed up the timetable when they learned one bear was pregnant. If the mother gave birth out of the wild, she might reject her cub. So a release was planned as soon as possible. Given the season, the team had to make dens for the bears near their original homes. The dens had to be as far apart as possible to keep the bears from disputing territory.

Taylor Swift seems like one of the few artists whose music videos are still a big deal, in part because she's so enormously popular, but also because she goes all out every time. The new video for ""Delicate,"" the latest single off her multi-platinum album Reputation, is no exception. Here are some things you might have missed amid all the excitement of ""Delicate's"" video debut.

It has been a WILD ride yall. Thank you so much to everyone who has supported and joined me along the way! You all mean the world to me! It feels almost impossible to condense this year down into just a few minutes, but overall it was an incredible experience that completely shifted my perspective on myself and the kind of person I want to be. I've never felt so empowered to be the best version of myself knowing that God is right beside me helping me every step of the way. :)

Lyrics

Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do

I can't believe that you need my love so bad
You come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see

'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, and slip away
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oi77vyjhuk8/sddefault.jpg,0.0272807673991428,0.0005782706306551466,47.17647058823529,0.0016667800530648345,0.027859038029797945,0.02952581808286278,2018-05-11,07:00:01,Friday,4,15,69,15,25,90,475,6,48,0,0,12,51,4,7,5.0,6.0,"[':', 'ba']","[':', 'ba']",True,"[':', 'ba']",2,2,3,1,0,0,0,4.508395479225081,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

▶재료 (1호 무스 1개 분량)

오레오 쿠키(크럼) 100g 
생크림 50ml

크림치즈 200g
설탕 30g
생크림 200ml
오레오 쿠키(크럼) 100g

데코용 오레오 5개 oreo

베이킹 키트에는 오레오 쿠키, 크림치즈, 생크림, 설탕, 종이 계량컵, 무스 띠가 들어있어요 
(무스 링은 옵션) 집에 무스 링이 있거나 떠먹는 치즈케이크를 만들고 싶으시면 무스 링은 제외!
(믹싱 볼과 거품기, 주걱은 준비해주세요!)

설탕, 오레오 쿠키 등이 계량되어 집으로 배달되기 때문에 따로 저울이 필요 없어요
노오븐! 오레오 치즈케이크 만들어 보세요 

미리 준비 할 것 - 무스 링에 무스 띠 안쪽에 감아두기, 냉장 재료 실온에 두기

1) 오레오 크럼 100g과 생크림 50ml를 잘 섞어줍니다
2) 준비한 무스 링 (혹은 용기)에 섞은 재료를 넣고 주걱으로 꾹꾹 눌러 줍니다
3) 냉장실에 30분 넣어둡니다
4) 그동안 실온에 둔 크림치즈를 잘 풀어줍니다
5) 설탕을 넣고 섞어줍니다
6) 다른 볼에 남은 생크림을 넣고 휘핑합니다
7) 묽은 상태로 휘핑이 되었으면 크림치즈에 2번 나눠 넣어가며 섞어줍니다
8) 오레오 크럼을 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다 (100g 다 넣어도 좋고 장식용 3분의1 정도 남겨두어도 좋아요)
9) 냉장실에 넣어둔 무스 링을 꺼내 크림을 채워 주걱으로 눌러 평평하게 만듭니다
10) 장식용 크럼을 남겼다면 위에 뿌려주고 냉장실에 넣어 충분히 굳혀줍니다 
11) 무스링을 제거하고 오레오로 장식합니다 

개인적으로 이 케이크 먹을 때 바닥 쿠키 부분이 제일 맛있어요 희희
끼리 크림치즈로 만들어서 더 괜찮은 것 같아요 
동물성 크림이라서 식물성 보다 덜 느끼하고 우유향도 나구요 :-)
무스 띠 감으면 선물하기도 좋아요 :-)
시청해주셔서 감사합니다 ~

Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat.  But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.

The results are hilarious.

On top of downing Apple Sourz and eating custard biscuits, Donald is currently riding high at the minute with his epic ""This Is America"" single currently topping the U.S. Billboard charts. The man can do no wrong.

See Donald & Phoebe in Solo: A Star Wars Story is in UK cinemas now.

Dr. Marshall refutes the commonly held idea that cells are just bags of watery enzymes. He runs through his “Top 10 List” of unexpected and amazing things that individual cells can do. These including growing to be huge, navigating mazes, and performing feats that seem to belong in science fiction.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Wallace Marshall is a Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.  He is also a Director of the Physiology Summer Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.  Marshall’s lab is interested in how single cells count and measure to determine cell size, number and organization. They have developed the single celled giant ciliate Stentor coeruleus as a molecular and genomic model organism for these studies.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooA0J6DWWTM/sddefault.jpg,0.050165094940200834,0.0005177784756941203,96.88524590163937,0.004863722402831654,0.05068287341589496,0.055546595818726605,2017-11-20,20:17:42,Monday,0,8,7,8,7,53,87,3,22,1,0,7,2,1,0,6.0,12.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.588866518082873,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Our lives are lived in 1 of 3 places, the home, the workplace and the “third place,” which is anywhere outside of those two.

Toward the end of the 20th century, the regional shopping mall had become that third place, the hang-out spot in suburban America. This was largely by design — an immigrant architect created the first mall in the vision that it would be a community gathering place.

The plan didn’t work out as he intended. While malls did take off, they more often than not couldn’t quite catch on as ideal “third places.” But with an estimated 25% of shopping malls expected to close in the next five years, there’s an opportunity  to re-examine where Americans spend their time and what could be the next iteration of the third place.

Further reading for those interested in this subject, I recommend the following books and articles:

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

As a teenager, Bob Thissen rummaged through abandoned buildings for fun. About 11 years ago, he decided to go pro with his intrepid interest. Today, Thissen is the 32-year-old filmmaker behind the YouTube channel Exploring the Unbeaten Path, where he's upgraded from investigating urban sites with only his curiosity to now having a drone, cameras, and a microphone, too. Thissen is an urban explorer, a subculture of people who explore manmade spots that, for one reason or another, have been abandoned and left to decay. He has visited hundreds of locales, including more than 50 countries on four continents. From soviet space shuttles to disaster-stricken cities, take a look at some of his favorite adventures from the year.

Learn more about these locations in an Q&A with filmmaker Bob Thissen.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oqxZ1M6grP4/sddefault.jpg,0.014411404274044378,8.954360901678559e-05,160.94285714285715,0.0004272509344515198,0.014500947883061163,0.014928198817512684,2017-11-14,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,10,38,9,33,48,334,4,79,0,1,7,14,1,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.130341435103701,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

- Remembering Margot Kidder, the original Lois Lane

- Kevin Feige Confirms ‘Plans’ for Ms. Marvel After Captain Marvel

- Kevin Hart in Talks to Star in Warner Bros.’ ‘Uptown Saturday Night’ Remake

- First Trailer for Spike Lee’s New Movie ‘BlacKkKlansman’ Reveals the Provocative Adaptation

- Live Twitter Questions

Production is already underway on the much-anticipated Captain Marvel from Marvel Studios, but that’s not stopping the studio from thinking even further ahead. Speaking with the BBC Arabic’s Husam Asi, MCU Mastermind Kevin Feige revealed that after the debut of Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel, we might just be getting her most recent counterpart.

Variety reports that Kevin Hart in talks to star in Warner Bros. Uptown Saturday Night remake. Sources for Variety say the studio is now focused on finding a director before looking for Hart’s co-star, and should have one locked in soon. The original movie starred Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby and followed two friends who sneak out to visit a high-class but illegal club when trouble ensues.

After screening at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it’s a strong contender for competition of the Palme d’Or, the first trailer for writer-director Spike Lee‘s BlacKkKlansman has landed online. The film is based on the true story of an African-American police officer who went undercover to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. It opens in theatres this August 10th.

20th Century Fox is bringing Queen fans everywhere an early look at the man, the myth, and the music in Bohemian Rhapsody, a biopic that explores the rise and fall of the seminal band and its star, Freddy Mercury. It’s just a brief glimpse for the moment, but the full trailer will be revealed later.

THR is reporting that Meryl Streep has signed on to star in Steven Soderbergh’s new drama entitled The Laundromat; with Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas also in talks to star. Based on the Panama Papers, the movie will tell the true story of the leaked documents that showed how Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm, allowed the wealthy and the connected to funnel money illegally in and around the world.

There are certain people that stand out among the crowd because they don't act like everyone else. Surely, even among your friends and acquaintances there is an eccentric person, who acts and behave in a different way, right? If so, then you can them this video right now! As a rule, big groups don’t like these people and often laugh at them. But experience has proven that weird people are ultimately right, and others, yielding to the herd instinct, simply rejected them.

Erk Killmonger is quickly becoming a fan favourite villain. And it’s easy to see why – like many of the other well-crafted villains we’ve encountered in comics, he’s a bad guy who has a point. The philosophies behind his actions are almost justified, except for, you know, hurting people and breaking laws and trying to usurp the throne of Wakanda. Not entirely things you’d classify under ‘good’. All that being said, we still adore Killmonger, so that’s why we’ve put together a list highlighting some tidbits about the character you may or may not have known, with our list of the top 10 Erik Killmonger Shocking Facts.

For Bradley, a college student from Jacksonville, Florida, a tiny house was the perfect solution to his accomodation dilemma. 

Become a Living Big Patron: https://www.patreon.com/livingbig

His home is named Rolling Quarters, partly a play on words that relates to the living quarters on wheels, but also a reference to saving money and the fact that Bradley was able to construct his own home without following the traditional model of financing and living with debt.

Constructed as a DIY project, this tiny house was constructed for only US$15,000. With the home now complete, Bradley is able to concentrate on his college work without the worry of rent payments and once his studies are complete, he has a debt free home to take with him into the future.

1) Justice League opens to disappointing $96 million domestic; Box Office Report

2) Quentin Tarantino’s New Film Lands at Sony

3) First teaser released for The Incredibles 2; Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener join voice cast

4) 'Danger Girl' Movie in the Works From 'Hitman,' 'Resident Evil' Producers

5) New trailer and poster for Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle in Time

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

Justice League finally debuted over the weekend in over 4,000 theatres and in doing so, fell far short of industry expectations. The movie took the No 1 spot, with an estimated $96 million, far below the projected $120 some outlets pegged for its opening. Wonder took the No 2 spot with an estimated $27 million, while Thor Ragnarok took the No 3 spot with an estimated $21.7 million, for a domestic total just shy of $250 million. Daddy's Home took the No 4 spot with an estimated $14.8 million and Murder on the Orient Express rounds out the top five with an estimated $13.8 million.

Deadline reports that the bidding war for Quentin Tarantino’s next movie is officially over and Sony has landed the rights to distribute. Details about the deal, according to THR, point out that Tarantino demanded a budget of $93 million to get the 1960s-set project made, along with back end points and immense creative control as well as final cut. The film will be another Tarantino-esque view on history, specifically Los Angeles in the late 60s, with Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio all being mentioned for the two lead male roles.

BUY OR SELL

Disney-Pixar has released the first teaser for Incredibles 2. The upcoming film will pick up after the events of the first movie, with the official synopsis revealing that the movie will focus more on Helen Parr/Elastigirl as Bob/Mr. Incredible stays home to raise Jack-Jack. The film also added, via the Tracking Board, the voices of Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener; who will join returning voices Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L Jackson. The movie is set for release on June 15, 2018.

THR reports that Constantin Films, the company behind the Resident Evil movie series, has picked up the film rights to Danger Girl, the hit 1990s comic book, and is developing the title with Jeremy Bolt's Bolt Pictures and Adrian Askarieh's Prime Universe Films to produce film and television shows.

A new trailer and poster has been revealed for Disney and Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle in Time. The highly anticipated movie follows Meg Murry, her brilliant brother Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin on an unexpected journey into alternate dimensions to bring home their father played by Chris Pine.

I hit a local pond in hopes of doing a Trout or panfish catch n cook on the ice, but was surprised by the solid population of channel catfish! I decided to take the lemons I was given and do a video I'd never done; a catfish catch n cook, while out on the ice. In the video I show how to clean and cook catfish whole, and they turned out delicious!

Lyrics: 
It ain’t no wonder why we lose control 
When we’re always a heart attack away from falling in love 
Well I know that we’ve been hardly holding on 
To tell the truth I can’t believe we got this far 

Running near on empty 
I wish somebody would’ve told me 

That I’d end up so caught up in need of your demons 
That’d I’d be lost without you leading me astray 
Guess that I’m a fool for the way for the way that you cut me 
Girl you make my heart break more every day 
But don’t fade away 

And when I’m just about to pass the point of it all 
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs 
Now it’s so hard to breath 
I wish somebody would’ve told me 

That I’d end up so caught up in need of your demons 
That’d I’d be lost without you leading me astray 
Guess that I’m a fool for the way for the way that you cut me 
Girl you make my heart break more every day 

Well I know that we’ve been hardly holding on 
To tell the truth I can’t believe we got this far

In Worth It: Lifestyle, a spin off of BuzzFeed’s hit series Worth It, host Steven Lim and his buddies embark on a new adventure, setting out to try different experiences at three different price points: affordable, middle tier, and luxury--from airplane seats to cars to videos games. At the end of the episode, the gang decides which experience is the most “worth it” at its given price.

[앵커] 
영화보다 더 극적이었습니다. 북한 귀순병사의 긴박했던 탈출과정이 공개됐는데요. 오늘 공개된 CCTV 영상을 보면 북한군이 군사분계선 너머로 총격을 가하고 군사분계선도 넘어왔던 사실이 확인되면서 논란이 커지고 있습니다. 

[앵커] 
김형준 명지대 교수, 차재원 부산가톨릭대 교수, 김태현 변호사와 함께 종합 정리합니다. 어서오십시오. 

[인터뷰] 
안녕하십니까. 

[앵커] 
추격조의 필사적인 사격을 뚫고 온 북한군 병사. 사선을 넘나들었던 모습 공개되었습니다.


주제어 보시죠. 


[앵커] 방금 영상에서 13일 전, 이렇게 자막이 나갔는데 



13일에 발생했던 북한군 병사의 귀순 장면 그날 그 모습이 생생하게 담겼는데요. 


교수님 영화보다 더 극적이었다고 평가가 나오고 있어요.

[인터뷰] 
그렇죠. 자유를 찾아서 남으로 넘어오는 북한 병사의 나름대로 절박한 사정을 우리가 생생하게 지켜보는 한 장면이 아닌가 생각이 드는데요. 어쨌든 지금 우리가 세계 유일의 분단국가입니다만 이 분단국가에서 이렇게 북한의 병사가 자유를 찾아서 넘어오는 데 있어서 북한이 또 총격을 가하고 이러한 어떻게 보면 인권이 완전히 말살되는 장면이 또 전 세계에 낱낱이 드러나는 그러한 오늘 하나의 장면입니다.

이런 걸 보면 빨리 남북 간 화해의 협력을 통한 어떤 식으로든 지금 분단 상황의 개선이 필요하다는 것을 또 한편 느끼는 것이고 또 한편으로는 북한의 경비병들 지금 또 자유를 찾아서 넘어오는 북한 병사에 대한 무차별한 저런 총질에 대해서는 어떤 식으로든 나중에 통일이 되고 난 이후에라도 책임을 묻는 조치는 있어야 되지 않겠나 생각이 듭니다.

[앵커] 
영상을 보면 군용 지프를 타고 아주 전속력으로 달리지 않습니까? 이쪽 지리를 잘 알고 뭔가 체계적으로 준비를 했나 이런 생각도 듭니다.

[인터뷰] 
그렇죠. 왜냐하면 일반 사람 같으면 상상하지 못할 정도로 자유를 향한 것에 대한 것을 넘어서서 굉장히 나름대로 목숨을 건 탈출이지 않겠습니까? 전속력을 다해서 또 어떤 면에서 봤을 때는 저게 일종에 우리 쪽을 향해서 보내는 시그널일 수도 있을 텐데요. 여하튼 간에 이걸 보면서 영화도 저렇게 만들기 힘들 것 같다는 생각이 들어요.

Lyrics:

Slipping through the cracks 
Stab myself in the back 
Motivation lacks 
To keep your feet down on the tracks 

Lost your purpose down the rabbit hole 
The bags under my eyes don’t have much room to hold 
More baggage, can you stand it? 
Is your carriage crash landing again? 

This cloud ran out of rain 
I want to feel something 
Even if its pain 
Does it all feel the same? 
Left or right lane 
We’re swerving the wrong way 
 
You’re digging deeper 
Collision 
Toward the keeper 
Blurred vision 
You’re digging deeper 
Decisions 
I’m digging deeper 
Division 

Lost your purpose down the rabbit hole 
The bags under my eyes don’t have much room to hold 
More baggage, can you stand it? 
Is your carriage crash landing again? 

This cloud ran out of rain 
I want to feel something 
Even if its pain 
Does it all feel the same? 
Left or right lane 
We’re swerving the wrong way 
We’re always the wrong way 
 
You take a hold of me 
Left your soul for me 

Fall asleep and
Fall behind and

The event is called a bird strike. Each year, bird strikes cost US airlines an estimated $1.2 billion. Only part of those costs are from actual damage. The rest comes from flight delays and cancellations.

A bird strike can disable a plane's engine. But engines are designed to withstand at least one bird. Plus, pilots can still fly a plane with just one operating engine.

Some of his interactions with reporters will probably be tense, especially as New England inches closer to the big game. But it’s unlikely that any of them will be as tense as the Brady interview that took place on Boston radio station WEEI early Monday morning.

Brady appears on WEEI every week throughout the NFL season to talk about whatever is going on in his life at the time. This season, he has spoken about everything from his friendship with Floyd Mayweather to his thoughts on that wild Jimmy Garoppolo rumor during his WEEI appearances. But Brady was in no mood to talk on Monday morning after what one WEEI host said about his 5-year-old daughter Vivian during a show late last week.

WEEI host Alex Reimer was talking about Brady on the station’s Mut at Night show when he was asked about the Patriots quarterback’s new Tom vs. Time documentary series that debuted recently. Reimer responded by saying that one of the scenes in the show seemed ""so staged."" And while that probably wouldn’t have ruffled many feathers, Reimer also made some disparaging comments about Brady’s daughter with his very next breath by referring to her as ""an annoying little pissant.""

I've tried to include a lot of detail so it is a long video, a lot of you will already be able to build wheels already and may have different techniques but this is how I like to do it. 

I didn't include things like hammering the shoulders or using a spanner to twist the spokes more as the stamping of the spokes does pretty much the same job.

BIG thanks to Light Bicycle for the rims, Industry Nine for the Hubs and Tartybikes for the spokes!!

But Jones is hardly a shoe-in. He’ll need African Americans — who make up more than 1 in four of the state’s registered voters — to turn out en masse.

VICE News is in Alabama to see how Jones is doing.

[Verse 1]
I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Verse 2]
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us
This is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, this is us
This is us, this is

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
And they call me the sick boy

[Refrain]
Don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Bridge]
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself on my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm from the east side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I'm from the east side of America
They say that I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

But now the BBC has uncovered details of a secret deal that let several hundred IS fighters escape. IS made Raqqa in northern Syria its headquarters in early 2014. Last month Raqqa fell, but this programme has learnt that in exchange for a deal to save lives and bring peace to the city, a convoy carrying several hundred IS fighters, their families and weapons and ammunition -- were able to leave the city freely. The question now is, where are they now? Our Middle East Correspondent, Quentin Sommerville, has this exclusive report.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

FURTHER READING

“Thinking about ourselves – our feelings, our past, our desires and our hopes – is a hugely tricky task that most of spend a good deal of effort trying very hard to avoid. We keep away from ourselves because so much of what we could discover threatens to be painful. We might find that we were, in the background, deeply furious with, and resentful about, certain people we were only meant to love. We might discover how much ground there was to feel inadequate and guilty on account of the many errors and misjudgements we have made. We might find that though we wanted to be decent, law-abiding people, we harboured fantasies that went in appallingly deviant and aberrant directions. We might recognise how much was nauseatingly compromised and needed to be changed about our relationships and careers…”

1. Will there ever be another “Godfather” Film or TV series? 

2. If The Prequels were released before the original trilogy, do you think fans would be upset with the of characters such as Obi-Wan and Yoda?.

3. What actors are the De Niro/ Pacino of today. 

4. Wonder Woman defeated Ares by herself, but needed help to beat Steppenwolf in ‘Justice League’. Did you notice this at all? Would love to hear your thoughts.

5. Why is it that mostly every movie on someone’s Top 10 Best Films Ever Made is not a recent movie?

In all seriousness, I'm really proud of this video and these 25 rubber band tricks took a long while to think of and actually get to work. Surprisingly, I have never used a rubber band in a machine before, but I genuinely wanted to explore the concept, and boy am I satisfied. I believe they have a huge unused potential and I will be using them a lot in future machines!
I'm glad to be back on YouTube! The stress of senior year and college apps is over (receiving many decisions rn and hoping for the best!) and I will now have more time to make videos. I still don't know what the future of my channel is going to be when I enter college, but we'll wait and see :)
I'm hoping to build a housewide machine either over spring or summer break, and I also have other various projects planned.

Curry has had Paul’s number since the Warriors became championship contenders in 2014.

On Wednesday night, Paul finally exacted his revenge.

Paul drove on Curry late in the second quarter of Game 2, then sent the two-time MVP sliding to the ground with a vicious behind-the-back move. He then found P.J. Tucker on a baseline cut to complete the highlight.

The ankle-breaking crossover was a form of payback to Curry, who dropped Paul years ago with a similar behind-the-back move. This one was much nastier: a double behind-the-back baseline crossover that left Paul grasping at the air.

It’s been a long time coming, and Paul and Curry will have more opportunities to drop each other in the future. But for now, let’s just appreciate this point guard rivalry. Looks like it’s Curry’s turn.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p7Jm1m8afAw/hqdefault.jpg,0.0054652573589690345,0.000378924510221853,14.423076923076925,0.001318948775964527,0.005844181869190886,0.007163130645155414,2018-05-25,14:47:15,Friday,4,12,1,12,1,70,2,4,2,2,0,7,0,1,0,5.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.540880107430054,2,"['neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

Cardi B performed at Coachella, fully pregnant, and did not skip a beat. 

Cardi B made her Coachella performance debut over the weekend and did not disappoint. 

Cardi B may be in her second to third trimester, but she worked that Coachella stage with no problem. She hit the stage Sunday night where she brought out a number of special guests including 21 Savage, YG, G-Easy, Chance the Rapper, and Kahlani. Cardi put on a show for thirty-five minutes complete with backup dancers grinding on stripper poles and hanging from the scaffolding behind her. The set included everything from her verse on Bruno Mars’ Finesse, to Ring with Kahlani, No Limit with G-Easy were she changed the lyrics to QUOTE - “Fuck him then I get some money/Fuck him then I got a baby!” She also performed Best Life, Bartier Cardi, Get Up 10, and Bodak Yellow. Might I add that her pregnant belly didn’t stop her from dropping it low, picking it back up in twerking. TMZ has receipts. 

Hours before she took the stage, it was announced that her album, Invasion of Privacy hit number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Not to mention, Invasion of Privacy just had the biggest streaming week ever. Cardi is killin’ it. Cardi stepped out on the Coachella stage dressed head to toe in white and paid homage to Left Eye from TLC with her hair style.

I have no idea about when part 5 will be done... probably within the next 30 years though. No promises. It's difficult work.
❤ THANKS FOR WATCHING AND HAVE A NICE DAY ❤

⊗ PLEASE DO NOT REUPLOAD ⊗ Reuploading my videos to your channel drives traffic away from my channel and makes it more difficult to continue this project!  This was four years to make and I rely on YouTube earnings to make these in the first place.  If you would like to share my work,  use the video URL to link back to here. If you want to do reaction video with the animation small in the corner that's fine.


✧ ABOUT THE PROJECT ✧
⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊⚊

Here is the continuation of Part 3 of Superman vs Hulk. When last we left our heroes Superman was mightily flying Hulk up into the sky. I hear all the time, Superman would just fly Hulk into space and be done with it. I always thought Hulk would put up a bit of a fight and maybe not just let Superman fly him into space. Anyway the fight in the sky I thought would be cool after a lot of ground fighting. So this is my interpretation of what might happen if they were to do battle in the sky.

I use the 80's film and television versions of these characters as that as what I grew up watching and inspired this in the first place. Christopher Reeve's likeness is used as in the previous version with slight model enhancements from the last one. I chose to give Hulk a closer resemblance to Lou Ferrigno, in face and body proportion but an eight foot tall, even more jacked version, minus the goofy wig.  I use their likeness with all respect and hope it does their portrayals justice.

As stated above this was four years in the making. I usually work about 50 hours a week, pretty much whenever I'm home and render day and night on three work computers. There were times I was not interested in working on it and from time to time I take little breaks or go on vacation. Also had taken a studio job doing visual effects for about 8 months for a break and also earn some cash and learn new skills. So if I hadn't done any of that it may have been done almost a year earlier but that's the way it goes. I need a break from it. At a certain point I was really tired of working on it and not really liking it at all. I will share those videos soon so watch for them. Each shot went through many revisions and a lot of stuff was changed or taken out over the years. Took a while to find the right beats to hit. I think it turned out alright though not perfect or studio quality. It was a lot more difficult to stage a sky battle than I thought it would be, a lot more than a ground fight, so I kind of look forward to continuing it on the ground.

Terragen was used for making the environment and Maya for the characters. Nuke for compositing and Vegas for editing.

Francois Gratecap again did the excellent music work and a first pass at the sound design but that was when the video was not complete so I took over the sound design for a lot of it so forgive the less than perfect sound quality.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pBbsvavno8I/sddefault.jpg,0.0047712577654087755,0.0007492897582775787,6.367707168955104,0.00028778257103568867,0.005520547523686354,0.005808330094722044,2018-01-01,06:10:46,Monday,0,8,14,8,13,37,104,3,25,0,0,5,5,1,0,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5882927049650135,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'horse': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Eminem's music video for ""River"" did a lot more than get fans curious about his romantic past — it also introduced us to an up-and-coming star. So who is that girl, and where have we seen her before?

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show.

Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is a style of combustion that uses two different fuels and results in a super efficient engine. Thermal efficiencies as high as about 60% have been found in lab testing, which is remarkable for internal combustion engines. 

Combustion relies on a low reactivity fuel (in this case gasoline, though ethanal and natural gas can also be used) in combination with a high reactivity fuel (in this case diesel fuel). The engine benefits from the individual advantages of each fuel, resulting in exceptional efficiency and significantly less harmful emissions. Check out the video for details about how it works!

Mark Ruffalo has earned a reputation as one of Hollywood's genuine good guys. The Wisconsin-native is as humble a movie star as you're likely to meet, but life hasn't always been as kind to him as he is to others. In fact, given everything he's been through, it's a wonder that he isn't a total jerk. Today, the affable Avenger is enjoying the heights of his fruitful career, but before he played the Hulk in Hollywood's biggest franchise, he had to first experience the lowest of lows. From crippling poverty and illness to several brushes with death, this is the tragic - but ultimately triumphant - real-life story of Mark Ruffalo...

His family went bankrupt | 0:34
He battled real-life anger issues | 1:34
He suffered from anxiety | 2:35
He had a brain tumor | 3:31
Half of his face was paralyzed | 4:51
Did somebody take his brother's life? | 5:47
He was accused of terrorism… or was he? | 7:14

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:

The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

Hi loves! Today's storytime saturday is about the Airbnb nightmare my friends and I experienced last weekend in LA! Don't worry, I've included a tiny bit of live footage so you can see what I'm talking about. As I said in the video, it was totally my fault for not reporting it to the host or Airbnb during our stay. I was naive and didn't even know that was an option. None of this was Airbnb's (or even the host's really) fault and it's funny now so I just wanted to share this funny Airbnb horror story with y'all. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed! Give it a thumbs up if you did and don't forget to SUBSCRIBE for more storytimes! I love you forever xoxoxo, Carrie Dayton

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pGFMR5Kn77k/sddefault.jpg,0.02125749596822597,0.0002713944979984656,78.32692307692308,0.0006784862449961637,0.02152889046622444,0.0222073767112206,2018-04-20,08:45:00,Friday,4,5,37,5,32,40,331,2,76,0,1,4,16,1,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.535234832078128,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

PO BOX 551 Windermere, FL 34786-0551

We had just left Chick Fil A when this happens. 
Keren holds her hand out while driving. I put my hand in her hand. 
She asks, “What are you doing?”
I reply, “Holding your hand.”
She says, “Give me my damn French fries.”
I jokingly say, ""I ate them all.""
She smacks me so hard, I fly out of the car and onto the sidewalk where I have to walk home the rest of the way. I cried. The sidewalk cried with me. I don't joke about her fries anymore.

Rodney Stotts used to deal drugs in the streets of Anacostia. When he started working for Earth Conservation Corps, he was able to turn his life around and discover his true passion, falconry. Now a local educator and master falconer, Stotts travels with his Harris Hawks and a lovable owl named Mr. Hoots to share his remarkable story. 

In this short video, Stotts describes how he came to love and care for these unique birds and the profound impact they’ve had on his worldview.

And now that’s she solidly back together with Liam Hemsworth, she can’t stop talking about him. And NOW we’re talking about the seven times Miley was SUPER candid about her relationship with Liam.

Last night at the Rakuten TV Empire Awards, Ram Bergman, Rian Johnson’s producing partner, spoke to Empire magazine and gave an update on the status of Johnson’s new trilogy. Bergman said: “We’ve started. Slowly, slowly, but we’ve started. Hopefully soon we’re going to get busier.” A number of people have been speculating that Johnson might not be getting a chance to finish his trilogy after the divisiveness of ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’, but this sounds like it’s starting to happen. Later on the red carpet, Johnson said that he still had to “figure out what it’s going to be.”

Mark Reilly and John Rocha are here to offer their thoughts on this news and talk about what this trilogy might tackle. They also talk about the reasons for why Disney and Lucasfilm are still going forward with this trilogy. Let us know what you think about this news and about what Mark and Rocha had to say in the Comments section below.

In one day, we had 5 delicious street foods in Varanasi. I didn’t even realize until we were finished eating, but we didn’t eat any meat or chicken for the whole street food tour vlog. It was really a true vegetarian HEAVEN! We started our Indian street food tour with an amazing INDIAN BREAKFAST made of spiced potatoes and cauliflower known as Aloo Gobi.  It was served with a puri and was quite spicy and very cheap. It was definitely a delicious street food to have in Varanasi India.

After this, we walked DEEP into another lane and found a MALAI milk cream spiced with saffron. It was very delicious, frothy, creamy, and sweet.

Next up, we went for another milk based street food in India, the LASSI. It was quite sweet as well and was served with a ton of pistachio! After finishing our delicious Indian breakfast street food in Varanasi, we went for a HUGE Indian lunch at a famous Indian restaurant in Varanasi. The Indian recipes here were absolutely delicious. There were some baked dumplings that were super unique, you’ll have to watch the street food vlog to find out why, but they were definitely worth coming for. All the flavours here at this Indian restaurant were spicy, tangy, sweet, astringent, and overall very healthy and we would definitely come back to eat more of this delicious food.

After this, we went for our final street food in Varanasi, the paan. It was packed with spices and very cheap. A very strong flavour that I’m not sure I would eat again, but definitely worth trying once on the streets of India

The street food restaurants in Varanasi, India, are listed below

1) Delicious Indian Breakfast Street Food Poori and Sabzi - The Ram Bhandar
2) Malai - Same alleyway as this delicious Indian breakfast
3) Lassi at Blue Lassi Shop
4) Amazing Indian Lunch Feast at Baati Chokha Restaurant
5) Paan at Keshav Tambul Bhandar

""U.S. skier Lindsey Vonn got an icy response from Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Friday after she criticized President Donald Trump.
The Olympic gold medalist told CNN on Wednesday that she was representing the people of the United States, not Trump, at the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea. She added that she would not visit the White House if she won.
In a clip posted by Media Matters, the “Fox & Friends” hosts reacted as one might expect.
Ainsley Earhardt dismissed Vonn as “another Hollywood person who doesn’t agree with the president. Do you think he cares?”
Pete Hegseth said competing in the Olympics is “like wearing the flag in combat, in battle. It’s a team. You’re saying, ‘Well, no. It’s just we’re going to write off our president.’”
Then Earhardt replied with the coldest cut of all about Vonn: “Very un-American.””*

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.

“Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, with Angela Bassett, with Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis.

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

MILD SPOILERS

""Gravity Falls, the cult Disney animated series, gained a passionate and inquisitive fan following due in part to the talent of its all-star cast. But nearly two years after the show went off the air, one of those famous voices has been quietly replaced.

The first part of the three-part series finale, collectively titled “Weirdmageddon,” included a surprise voice performance by Louis C.K. as a character named “The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity.”*

Gotta go Fast! A 20 minute A ""Brief"" History? Obviously not fast enough. But you know who is fast? The Blue Blur himself - Sonic. Easily one of the most iconic video game characters ever, rivaling that of Mario himself since his initial debut in 1991, and since then Sonic has had a very long run. To this day the Sonic Franchise continues to put out game after game - for better or worse. In today's episode, we discuss the impact Sonic has had on the platform genre and how this lovable hedgehog has evolved over the years.

WHAT IT IS // LYRICS:
Pretty soon you have to deal
With the truth behind the way you feel
And I'd rather never know

I would do anything anything
Not to bring who I am to meet me
This useless suffering 
Ugly part of me is screwing me 
As it feeds me

But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible 
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is

Pretty soon you'll have to face
You're a virus called the human race
And I'll never never know

I have done everything everything 
Not to feel what it is I'm feeling
This basement devil is kicking the ass
Of my angel on the ceiling 

But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible 
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is

Don't push me, don't kill me 
What it is cause it is what it is
Don't play games, don't mess with
What it is cause it is what it is
Don't ask me, don't tell me
What it is cause it is what it is
Don't push me, don't kill me
What it is cause it is what it is
Don't run from where you come from
Cause it is what it is
And I
And I 

But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible 
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pUmuytn_Wao/sddefault.jpg,0.014148028581581196,0.00042411781930496784,33.35872235872236,0.0014442931143898905,0.014572146400886169,0.01601643951527606,2018-03-28,08:35:01,Wednesday,2,4,37,4,32,32,327,0,76,0,1,3,16,1,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.120903917534938,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"{'cup': 1, 'bottle': 12, 'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",16

The film is directed by The Russo Brothers and stars Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Tom Holland and Josh Brolin. This has been the culmination of ten years of MCU films and world building from Marvel, Disney and Kevin Feige. In the film, the Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe. The film’s ending will be talked about by hardcore fans and casual fans alike until we get ‘Avengers 4’ in May of next year.

Mark Reilly is here to gently guide you out of that ending and into an explanation about what that ending might have meant for the MCU and the numerous heroes/characters in it. He also goes over everything that occurred at the end there in case something slipped by you or you missed something. Sometimes you need a warm, knowledgeable voice to help you deal with endings and Reilly is here to help you get there. Let us know what you thought about what Reilly’s explanation of the ending of the movie and if it left you with more questions than you had when you went in to see the movie in the COMMENTS section below.

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:
The Screen Actors Guild Awards® presented by SAG-AFTRA has become one of the industry's most prized honors. The only televised awards show to exclusively honor performers; it presents thirteen awards for acting in film and television in a fast moving two-hour show, which airs live on TNT and TBS. The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

About The Alienist:
The Alienist is an upcoming American drama television series based on the novel of same name by Caleb Carr. The psychological thriller drama is set in 1896, when a series of gruesome murders of boy prostitutes has gripped the city. Newly appointed top cop Teddy Roosevelt calls upon Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a criminal psychologist -- aka alienist -- and newspaper illustrator John Moore to conduct the investigation in secret. Joining them in the probe is Sara Howard, a headstrong secretary at Police Headquarters.

Once again I was emailed another S8 Outline but this time it seems a little more legit than the previous one. Some of the things in this video do line up with how the series ended during the Season 7 finale but there are also some very CRAZY things in here as well. It's hard to say how much of this will be true but it's very interesting and entertaining to say the least. Hopefully you enjoy the video either way. It did take quite some time to edit it all. Thanks for watching. Let me know what you think!

LYRICS

Waiting on that letter from the college of my dreams
I’m hoping 
And wishing 
Maybe she can hand me down her jeep
Top down
And I’m singing

Some days
I’m happy and excited wanna shout it out
But I write it down
Ya some days 
I don’t know what will happen if I dream out loud
So I write em down

All of these 
All of these secrets
I keep em in 
Keep em in
My diary, my diary
x2
All of these all of these

Wondering if he likes me back or not
I’m hoping 
I’m wishing
Playing dress up with their clothes is more fun
If it’s missing
Then we’re twinning 

Some days
I’m happy and excited wanna shout it out
But I write it down
Ya some days 
Things don’t go as planned and I might get bummed out
So I write em down

All of these 
All of these secrets
I keep em in 
Keep em in
My diary, my diary
x2

All of these all of these
All of these, all of these
Secrets I keep
Written inside my diary in ink
ev-er-y new person place thought and dream
I keep it secret
Behind lock and key

All of, all of these
Secrets I keep
Written inside my diary in ink
Ev-er-y new person place thought and dream
All of these all of these things 

All of these 
All of these secrets
I keep em in 
Keep em in
My diary, my diary
x2

If you want a bottom line, that's it, but if you watch the video I go into a lot more detail. Because I couldn't take notes in the theatre there's a bunch I forgot, like a completely misplaced scene near the start where Batman's beard disappears, a sequence set to Icky Thump that seems to have been left in purely because they already paid the licensing fee, how Steppenwolf looks like he's been lifted from a Dragon Age: Origins cutscene, and Cyborg's uniformly weird, floaty movements that aren't strange enough to feel intentionally alien nor normal enough to feel natural.

Now he shares the court with the likes of LeBron James and Stephen Curry.

--------------------------------------------------

Following is a transcript of the video:

It's always easy to blame the referee. But what's it like to be that Official?

Zach Zarba: My name is Zach Zarba and I'm a 15-year NBA referee. The pressure is underestimated — you know, it's taken for granted sometimes. It takes a lot to be able to function and exist in a pressure-filled environment and you have to be calm.

Zach has had his fair share of court time. He played D3 basketball for SUNY New Paltz.

Zarba: My father was a baseball, local baseball umpire in Brooklyn and he did high school and college and he kind of gave me the idea to try officiating.

How did Zach become one of the NBA's 65 referees? It's a long road to reach his level.

Zarba: You start from the bottom. You start from CYO 4, 5-year-olds, 6 year olds. You work your way up. You do high school basketball, you do a little bit of college. I did a lot of work in the New York City Pro Am leagues and and then the D-League.

If you're good enough, you go to training camp. If that goes well, you might be recruited to the G-League. Only those at the top of the G-League get accepted as NBA referees

Zarba: You have to be able to run up and down with the best athletes in the world. You have to stay light. The lighter you are, the less wear and tear on your legs, on your knees, on your feet. That's going to give you a longer career.

Clearly, staying in shape is key. How does Zach stay trim?

Zarba: So, for me personally, it's an hour cardio a day. It’s core work, it's you know, abs. It's a lot of weight work on the legs to protect the knees.

Referees have to keep more than just their bodies in shape.

Zarba: I do a lot of meditation during the day before the game and stuff like that just in order to find a calm place in order to have clarity because we're making decisions that likely affect people's careers, people's jobs. Someone wins, someone loses and you just want the utmost clarity and peace in a charged environment.

On game day, Zach and his fellow officials will meet around 11 a.m. to catch up. They'll head to the arena 90 minutes before tip-off to run through their pre-game routine.

Zarba: The interaction with players is an ongoing art. Some nights are easier than others, but communication is key. Communication and listening skills are huge. At the end of the day, we may agree to disagree on some subjects, but the respect comes both ways. We are not more lenient with the stars. I would say the star players actually are disadvantaged more than anyone else. You're going to concede that we make mistakes, which we do, the mistakes we make are going to be on the people who have the ball in their hand 75% of the time, which in this case is the star players. They hold the ball 75% of the time. They put pressure on the defense and pressure on the officials, and if and when mistakes are made, they're usually made with them.

On top of the stress of the game, refs are on the road a ton. Sometimes for up to 10 days at a time

Zarba: The travel is difficult. For the more veteran guys, it's 24, 25 nights gone from your family a month. It's basically 8 months on and then 4 months off because all that time gone during the winter, you have to reconnect with your family and so we're home during the summer.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pb0h8H-xtYg/sddefault.jpg,0.012786492971773466,0.0002740440208273456,46.65853658536585,0.0007252140551162683,0.013060536992600812,0.01378575104771708,2018-04-13,15:48:43,Friday,4,8,25,8,20,34,236,0,43,1,0,7,4,5,0,3.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6881133690024654,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

More Dyson Cyclone V10 Info: https://goo.gl/Jr7HPh
Dyson just launched its brand new Cyclone V10 cordless vacuum, and it's the most powerful vacuum Dyson has ever made. The V10 is Dyson's smallest, lightest, most powerful motor yet and took more than five years to develop this latest iteration. Despite the V10 motor being 40% smaller, it's much more powerful spinning over 125,000rpm.

In this Dyson Cyclone V10 review, I give you a look at how it works, and why this is the best cordless vacuum 2018 has to offer. In fact, the Dyson Cyclone V10 is the vacuum that convinced Dyson that it no longer needed to invest in producing new upright vacuum cleaner models.

Some of the Dyson Cyclone V10 features:
New format with bin rotated 90 degrees combined with the powerful V10 motor has allowed us to create suction power that matches an upright machine

Newly designed user interface located on the battery pack signals if there is a blockage or if it's time to wash the filter.

Charges in 3.5 hours compared to 5 hours with the V8.

The washable filter is now only one piece which makes it even easier to clean. No longer two separate filters to clean.

The new bin in the V10 is 40% larger than the V8 Absolute cord-free vacuum.

The new bin orientation makes it much easier to eject dust and debris from the bin into your garbage.

Balanced in your hand - you can reach under low furniture or reach up high.

New: three power modes to choose from to suit any task on any floor type.

Lyrics:
He never knew my secret,
but I for sure knew his
In the arms of nature,
so let her take and give

The only thing that makes you grow
is to dive into the sweet unknown

The only thing that breakes your bones
is when you don't know where it hurts the most,
when you don't know when it hurts

So,
come on bring my witches home
I still hold the flame
And let the owls of wisdom roam
I still hold the flame

Dig deep baby dig deep baby
There's so much we can't see baby see baby
It's you and me so dig deep baby deep baby
So come along because
I still hold the flame

For followers of rivers
and lovers of the sun

The voices of victims
who have nowhere to run

The only thing that makes you grow
is to dive into the sweet unknown

The only thing that breakes your bones
is when you don't know where it hurts

So,
come on bring my witches home
I still hold the flame
And let the owls of wisdom roam
I still hold the flame

Dig deep baby deep baby
There's so much we can't see baby see baby
It's you and me so dig deep baby deep baby
So come along because
I still hold the flame

Huh huh…
For the believers and the seekers
Huh huh…
For the speakers and defenders
I still hold the flame
I still hold the flame
For the protectors of the mother

So,
come on bring my witches home
I still hold the flame
And let the owls of wisdom roam
I still hold the flame

Dig deep baby deep baby
There's so much we can't see baby see baby
It's you and me so dig deep baby deep baby
So come along because
I still hold the flame

We invite you to take a seat at the Dirt table for one last sitting of muddy British carnage.

Over the past six months we’ve battled the Beast from the East, jumped in freezing lochs and had Christmas in the Peak District. Most of all though, we’ve made riders go bigger, harder and faster than ever before and been there to capture it all.

This year’s film features Josh Bryceland, Brendan Fairclough, Tahnee Seagrave, Manon Carpenter, Olly Wilkins, Kade Edwards, Kaos Seagrave, The Dudes of Hazzard and so many more. Plus there’s all the usual chaos you’d expect from a Pie film.

We honestly believe this is the biggest and best Pie yet and couldn’t imagine bringing this rad adventure to a close any other way. Thanks to  Monster Energy, Focus Bikes, Fox, Norco, Deity, Stanton and DMR for their support on this film.

Tuck in.

The term didn't come naturally, or easily, to East London native Shantell Martin, who says that, growing up, the idea of being an artist was something that felt totally foreign to her. ""You know, I drew as a child,"" she says. ""We all draw as children. I never knew it was art, because I didn't have artists around me. I didn't have galleries around me. I didn't have museums around me, so I didn't know it was art. And then you look at the internet at that time, or you go to the library, and you look at all these books and you see what real artists look like. You see what real design is, and what illustrators look like. And that time, I thought, that's not me. So I had this real complex, this real struggle, with myself about calling myself an artist because I felt, well, what gives me the right?""

This boat we check out is an Irwin 52' - a very luxurious sailing yacht in it's heyday, and some still are kept in amazing condition. One of these boats in good shape typically sells for $200,000 to $300,000, so the question is... is it worth buying this gutted boat for $25,000?

Learning the Lines is a channel about us, an average couple in our 20's, with big dreams to be sailing the world by the time we're in our 30's. We're not afraid to jump into anything, put in the work, and learn as we go. For this reason our channel is very DIY focused, with the goal to show anyone watching that a lot is possible if you're not afraid to make some mistakes along the way.

안녕하세요 오늘은 녹차 다쿠아즈를 준비했어요
다쿠아즈는 겉은 바삭, 속은 부드러운 스펀지같은게 매력인 프랑스의 디저트입니다

안에 크림을 샌드하거나 크림대신 과일을 넣기도 한다고 하는데요
중독성 있는 식감이라 마카롱 보다 더 좋아하시는 분들이 꽤 있는 정도입니다

저도 가끔 생각나더라고요 오늘은 녹차맛으로 준비해보았습니다
녹차향이 은은한게 녹차 좋아하시면 딱 좋아할 것 같아요

▶재료 (샌드한 다쿠아즈 6~8개 분량)

- 다쿠아즈
흰자 3 (110g), 설탕 40g, 아몬드가루 70g, 슈가파우더 55g, 박력분 14g, 녹차가루 5g
슈가파우더 약간

- 버터크림
버터 130g, 녹차가루 10g, 생크림 50ml, 슈가파우더 40g

1) 오븐을 180~190도로 예열 한 뒤 흰자를 휘핑합니다

Best known for her Hollywood and television roles (Planet Terror, Scream, Jawbreaker, Charmed), she battled a sexist and abusive industry bent on hijacking her image, propelling her to become an activist and agent of change. It was McGowan’s explosive reports in The New Yorker and The New York Times that opened the floodgates that have brought sexual assault and harassment out of the shadows. Joined by journalist Ronan Farrow, who wrote The New Yorker story, McGowan talks about the experiences captured in her new book, BRAVE. Equal parts memoir and manifesto, the work is as fierce, raw and unapologetic as its creator.

Recorded on February 1, 2018 at the 92nd Street Y.

During his campaign, Trump famously stated that he had “the best words.” And there are a few he likes to use a lot, like the onomatopoeic “bing.”

Trump has used the sound to describe myriad things: puppets, playing cards, shooting guns, tweeting, malfunctioning rocket ships, and at least 16 other people, activities, and things. In some cases, however, the former reality-TV star can’t settle for a single “bing.” Trump often uses two or three bings in a row, for added effect. Heck he once issued eight consecutive bings to describe the “little mouth” on his then-rival Marco Rubio.

Watch the above video for a semi-comprehensive list of things that go “bing,” according to Donald Trump.

Major Lazer
J Balvin
Tell dem gyals dem

[J Balvin]

Mai tú parece de island
Hay algo en ti que no es normal
Y a mí ese algo me encanta
Me parece súper especial

eyyy

Se ve que no le gusta lo material
A ella es difícil darle
En su juego siempre quiere ganar

No sabe cómo parar
Cuando su cuerpo mueve
Más ella pide
no conoce el final

Ahhh ey ey

No te dejo de mirar
Ay ya parezco tu detective
Buscando huellas para encontrarte
Y tú más desapareces

Ya no me aguanta más,  yo la quiero tener
Su vibra poderosa la quiero tener
De misteriosos ojos me enamore
Ya oohh
Y queria ganar
De lejos la miro rechazando Botellas
No le importaba nada solo quería bailar
Le dijeron que Balvin quiere conocerla
Pero poco le interesaba

No sabe como parar
Cuando su Cuerpo mueve más ella pide
No conoce el final
Ahhh ya ya
No te dejo de mirar
Ay ya parezco tu detective
Buscando Huellas para encontrarte
Y tu me desapareces

[Sean Paul]
Heaven get send ya for me baby
Love how u move and me love how you stay
Love how you slay dem pon di daily
Definitely most definitely
Man a look time can u man a pree
And mi just can't get enough of your  body
Check me now girl
Tell me this is destiny tell me now that
You want me set you free baby girl

[J Balvin]
No sabe cómo parar
Cuando su cuerpo mueve
Más ella pide
no conoce el final

Ahh ya ya

No te dejo de mirar
Ay ya parezco tu detective
Buscando huellas para encontrarte
Y tú más desapareces

Sean Paul
Come get with it x4

The search for our origins go back to a single common ancestor -- one that remains shrouded in mystery. It’s the ancestor of everything we know and today scientists call it the last universal common ancestor, or LUCA.

Loves has no boundaries, especially when it comes to age. Before you call us creepers, we are simply talking about a love between two consenting adults! When we were teenagers, we were told to be in relationships with those who are of similar age to us. If you think about it, that concept made sense. If you were with someone who was a lot older than you, then there’s the risk of that person passing on before you, leaving you to be alone in this world. However, in this day and age, people are living longer than ever. When you’re a celebrity, you can almost do whatever you want. It also means that people love you regardless of how old you are. In fact, you might have a fanbase that has a varying age range. You could marry someone who is 100 years old, or marry someone 20 years younger than you. It’s amazing how fame and fortune can influence our decisions on life!

Within a few centuries, almost all of the island’s trees were slashed and burned to make room for farming. This rapid deforestation has resulted in massive soil erosion that puts the island at risk for desertification.

Today, the Icelandic Forest Service has taken on the mammoth task of bringing back the woodlands. With the help of forestry societies and forest farmers, Iceland’s trees are slowly beginning to make a comeback. Watch this short film by Euforgen to learn more about how their efforts are working to benefit Iceland's economy and ecology through forestry.

You heard the travelers’ tales, you followed the maps, and now, you’ve finally located the dungeon containing a stash of ancient coins. The good news: the wizard who owns the castle has generously agreed to let you have the coins. The bad news: he’s not quite as generous about letting you leave the dungeon ... unless you solve his puzzle. Can you solve it and get out alive? Lisa Winer shows how.

Matt is a young boy who just lost his mother. He doesn't fit in at school, and he misses her desperately.

He's adrift in his own grief and loneliness when he meets Angela, a girl who lives next door. She claims she's an alien -- and that she has a spaceship that can take him to a planet for departed souls.

The two launch a plan to reunite with their lost loved ones -- and learn to connect and empathize with one another in the process.

This touching drama, directed by Sam Shapson and A.J. Sheeran, features sweet but never saccharine writing and performances, and offers an imaginative take on grief and loss from a child's perspective.

""The Treehouse"" touches upon a simple universal truth -- no one is ever immune from loss or sadness. But it's through our friendships and other loving connections that we find solace, comfort and the help we need to move forward.

'안되나용' 작사, 작곡에는 밴드 '백호가 간다'의 보컬 공찬수와 작곡가 노상엽이 참여했으며, 뮤직비디오는 '송은이 김숙의 비밀보장', '김생민의 영수증', '셀럽파이브' 등 기발한 콘텐츠 기획으로 큰 사랑 받는 개그맨 송은이가 연출했다. 뮤직비디오에는 엄정화, 서장훈, 휘성, 모모랜드(혜빈, 연우, 주이) 등이 출연해 열연을 펼쳤다. 

김영철의 ‘안되나용’ 제작기는 JTBC [아는 형님] ‘아형 뮤비 대전’(2월 10일, 2월 17일 방송)에서 확인할 수 있다.

Black Mirror has emerged as a smartly critical anthology series about a not-so-distant dystopian future, and humans' relationship with technology. Most episodes feel like worst-case scenarios with the ambiance of The Twilight Zone for the 21st Century. Will our future interactions with technology be uplifting and empowering, or downright terrifying? Scary or not, though, some installments of Black Mirror are just plain better than others, so here's a ranking of every episode of the show so far, from worst to best. Do we even need a spoiler warning here?

※ 튀김 온도계가 없으신 분들은 반죽을 조금 떼어 넣었을 때 기포가 붙으며 두둥실 떠오르는 것을 확인해주세요.

※ 남은 반죽은 모양을 짠 뒤 냉동실에 보관하세요 :) 필요할 때 꺼내어 튀겨내면 된답니다!

“Before the 2018 Grammy nominations were announced Tuesday, many prognosticators thought the race for album of the year would boil down to two artists: British pop star Ed Sheeran for “÷ (Divide)” and rapper Kendrick Lamar for “DAMN.”

Sure enough, Lamar’s record made the list, along with Childish Gambino (“Awaken, My Love!”); Jay-Z (“4:44″); Lorde (“Melodrama”); and Bruno Mars (“24K Magic”). But Sheeran was nowhere to be found, much to the devastation of his fans — although “÷ (Divide)” did land a nod for best pop vocal album.

Soon, the absence of Sheeran’s expected nomination led to a Twitter “moment,” as the social media platform announced that the “Grammys album category has no white men for the first time in 19 years.”

Fred Rogers passed away 15 years ago, but his legacy as the host and creator of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood continues to live on. This summer, Rogers will be the subject of Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, a new documentary that takes a look back at his life and his influential children’s TV series. No one is perfect, not even Mister Rogers, but the trailer illustrates just how important it was to Rogers to spread kindness in the world. Within the context of his long-running PBS series, Rogers was able to educate his audience without flinching away from difficult topics like death and racism.

Watch the official trailer for Morgan Neville's new movie, Won't You Be My Neighbor? #MrRogersMovie

From Academy Award® -winning filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet from Stardom), Won’t You Be My Neighbor? takes an intimate look at America’s favorite neighbor: Mister Fred Rogers. A portrait of a man whom we all think we know, this emotional and moving film takes us beyond the zip-up cardigans and the land of make-believe, and into the heart of a creative genius who inspired generations of children with compassion and limitless imagination.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqNNt9EY8kc/sddefault.jpg,0.0236600979038534,0.000439312162671018,53.85714285714285,0.003200702899460273,0.024099410066524413,0.027300112965984686,2018-03-20,15:58:32,Tuesday,1,10,58,10,46,69,452,7,73,1,0,8,14,4,9,6.0,7.0,['GVEA hole ag'],"['GVEA', 'hole', 'ag']",True,"['gvea', 'hole', 'ag']",3,3,10,0,0,0,0,6.629335961974226,2,"['neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 4},4

Gigi Gorgeous and her longtime girlfriend Nats Getty shocked the world by announcing on Instagram that they are now parents of a little boy named Enzo. Gigi introduced her followers to her new bundle of joy with a family picture along with the caption QUOTE “Thank you so much to our beautiful surrogate.”

Gigi’s heiress girlfriend posted a different photo of the new family of three and wrote QUOTE “our little angel.”

Nats also shared a few videos on her Instagram story, including one in which she could be heard saying QUOTE “we’re gonna love you” as she held baby Enzo as Gigi looked on. 

The news of the couple’s family addition came so out of left field that some people aren’t entirely convinced that it’s true. 

One fan wrote on Twitter QUOTE “If this is a joke it’s not really funny seeing that so many people struggle to have children and can’t afford adoption or surrogates.... so yea good job.” 
Someone else said QUOTE “I bet this is another fake thing. I hope it isn’t cause Gigi is gonna get a lot of hate which she should for being so insensitive.” 

Another person pointed out that Gigi might be trolling people to get views writing QUOTE “Ummm this is totally adorable but something seems little click bait about this.” 

But just because some people are skeptical doesn’t mean Gigi and Nats didn’t get any love on social media. Thousands of fans shared their congratulations and well-wishes with the pair immediately after they received the news, even though they were obviously pretty shocked that one of their favorite YouTubers suddenly became a mom.

A follower named Kendryck replied QUOTE “I’M LITERALLY CHOKING!!! SINCE WHEN DID YOU HAVE A BABY?!?! I legit just time traveled congrats Gigi” 

A different fan said QUOTE “Congratulations!! The baby is absolutely beautiful and I wish you both so much love for the future!”

Gigi and Nats went public with their relationship in September 2016, and then briefly broke up that December. The girls ended up getting back together a few weeks later, however, and have been happy and in love ever since. 

I definitely did not see this one coming, but that doesn’t make it any less incredible...if it’s true, of course. Do you think Gigi and Nats really had a baby, or is the whole thing some elaborate click bait thing? Tell us your opinion in the comments below. I’m your host Tom Plumley, thanks so much for watching Clevver and I’ll see you next time.

LYRICS

What’s left to say?
These prayers ain’t working anymore
Every word shot down in flames
What’s left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?
I’m losing my voice calling on you

‘Cause I’ve been shaking, I’ve been bending backwards ‘till I’m broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke

Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes?

Can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?
‘Cause I need you here, oh

‘Cause I’ve been shaking, I’ve been bending backwards ‘till I’m broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke

Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes
Can beauty come out of ashes",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqYoyr6ypC8/sddefault.jpg,0.02537377887230243,0.00047074934737022304,53.900826446281,0.0011185160113135462,0.025844528219672654,0.0269630442309862,2018-05-16,13:15:17,Wednesday,2,10,23,10,20,59,197,3,46,1,0,5,0,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.335094883812653,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

About Life Below Zero:
Life Below Zero follows six people as they battle for the most basic necessities in the state with the lowest population density in the United States. Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.

It's the biggest cinematic event in years, and Avengers: Infinity War doesn't disappoint, shocking fans with all sorts of stuff that we're totally about to spoil. Seriously, this video is full of spoilers. What kind of spoilers? Well, like this spoiler: at the end of Infinity War, half the universe was wiped out with a single snap of Thanos's giant purple hot dog fingers. But considering the deaths were supposedly random, fans couldn't help but notice that all of the founding Avengers somehow survived. So why did these specific characters gain plot immunity? Here's a look at the real reasons these Avengers survived Infinity War...

El FC Barcelona ha ganado la III Supercopa de Catalunya, en un partido que se ha resuelto en la tanda de penaltis. El conjunto azulgrana ha anotado todos los lanzamientos desde los 11 metros y Cillessen ha parado el penalti decisivo a Jurado. Es la segunda edición del torneo que se lleva el equipo azulgrana, tras ganar también en los penaltis el año 2016 en Montilivi.

El partido ha comenzado con la oportunidad más clara del Barça en la primera mitad. A los treinta y ocho segundos de juego, Paco Alcácer no ha conseguido culminar una ocasión muy clara de gol. La opción más clara del Espanyol en la primera parte ha llegado en el minuto 39. Piatti ha enviado a las nubes, casi a bocajarro, un rechace de Cillessen. Y en el minuto 42, Denis Suárez, uno de los más activos en la primera parte, ha notado unas molestias y ha tenido que ser sustituido por Christian Rivera, llegando al descanso con el resultado inicial.

Valverde reparte minutos entre los jóvenes
En la segunda parte, ninguno de los dos equipos dominaba el juego y no llegaban las ocasiones de peligro. Sólo un centro de Piatti desde la banda izquierda que se ha envenenado y ha tocado el larguero ha inquietado a Cillessen en los primeros minutos de la reanudación. El técnico vasco ha aprovechado la segunda mitad para dar minutos de juego a los jugadores del banquillo. M.Hongla y Carlos Pérez han debutado con el primer equipo sustituyendo a André Gomes y O.Dembélé, y David Costas también ha disfrutado de minutos en el eje de la defensa.

Llegan las ocasiones
En el minuto 72, el Espanyol ha disfrutado de una buena opción, con un remate de Alex López que Cillessen ha desviado a córner con solvencia. Tres minutos después, Aleix Vidal ha probado a Pau López, que ha parado su disparo desde la frontal del área. El técnico vasco ha hecho debutar también a Abel Ruiz, Miranda y McGuane. En el minuto 77, Paco Alcácer ha vuelto a rozar el gol con un remate de cabeza, pero el portero blanquiazul ha frustrado la diana azulgrana. El delantero de Torrent lo ha vuelto a intentar en el minuto 89 con una falta lejana, pero se ha vuelto a encontrar con el portero rival, llegando a los penaltis, en los que se ha decidido quién sería el campeón.

Acierto absoluto en los penaltis
Los jugadores de Valverde han anotado los cuatro penatis que han lanzado. Alcácer, Palencia, Yerry Mina y Abel Ruiz han batido a Pau López. En el Espanyol, Alex López y Hermoso han anotado sus lanzamientos, pero Darder ha enviado el suyo por encima del larguero. En el penalti decisivo, Cillessen ha adivinado el disparo de Jurado, otorgando el título al FC Barcelona.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/prVw9XN5ZMA/sddefault.jpg,0.016114827366265887,0.0006372614667341567,25.287622439893145,0.00010327834990704947,0.016752088833000042,0.016855367182907092,2018-03-07,20:42:28,Wednesday,2,10,29,10,29,61,287,7,85,4,1,2,0,0,0,5.0,9.0,"['FULL MATCH', 'BARCA - ESPANYOL']","['FULL', 'MATCH', 'BARCA', '-', 'ESPANYOL']",True,"['full', 'match', 'barca', '-', 'espanyol']",5,5,23,1,0,0,0,6.701258531262965,19,"['happy', 'neutral', 'happy', 'happy', 'neutral', 'happy', 'angry', 'happy', 'angry', 'sad', 'happy', 'angry', 'neutral', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy']",3,0,0,12,1,0,3,{'person': 16},16

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.

Spielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. “Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” upcoming “Dunkirk”).

Behind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).
Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”

Slated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

ROOM 138 // LYRICS

On my back, breathing heavy staring at the light
Praying this isn't the end, but pretty sure it might be
On my back, got my heart beating out of my chest
I never thought, I can’t believe that I'd go out like this
So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurring as the light starts fade
Please pull me out of this
My ribs are breaking I swear, I'm only twenty three
Crawling, searching for a lifeline I just can't reach
Somebody hear me, someone open up the door
Get me up off of this floor and stop the shaking
The blood is boiling in my veins
Oh god the pain, it's unrelenting
I'm ready for the end if it means that all of this will end
So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurring as the light starts fade
Please pull me out of this
Through the haze I saw a face
A second chance, another life to live, how did you forgive me
Held my head against your chest, told me everything's alright, don't be afraid
Close your eyes and rest
So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurring as the light starts fade
Please pull me out of this

Transcript of the social video:

During a live interview with a film historian, we had a special appearance.

Umm that is my child, excuse me.

He can come in. it's not a problem Daniel. We are quite happy to have youngsters on the programme too.

Ok he wants to be a part of this, excuse me.

Right, my little child?

Yes.

Yes, that's great.

Thanks so much for joining us from Berkeley. 

Thank you very much for having us.

Watch Roger Bisby take drivers from Bosch, Dewalt, Hitachi, Hilti, Makita, Metabo, Milwaukee and Panasonic to see which one has the power and features of a champion. We also measure the sound level of these noisy machines.

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote and the crew get to meet Banjo the Koala! 

Living at the amazing Billabong Sanctuary near Townsville Australia Banjo is one of many Koalas that call this location home. While it is true that Koalas are undisputedly cute the crew were in for many surprises when meeting this particular arboreal marsupial. For one, male Koalas excrete a musk that smells like cheese, or “cheese its” as Mark “eloquently” claims. In addition to this pungent odor, did you also know that Koalas actually possess the ability to roar? 

Get ready to hear the call of Koala and watch one give the team super stinky hugs!

Lyrics:
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about those presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas is you
I wont ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do
You know that all I want for Christmas is you
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you
Is you

Ubisoft is really proving itself to support games even with rather lackluster responses and turning them around into games to be proud of down the line.

The Division is more like Diablo with guns than ever before.  Streamlined play that lets you do what you want and still progress without needing to jump through hoops or do types of gameplay you dislike.

I definitely recommend The Division in 2018.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, the hosts of The Young Turks, show you Trump’s most awkward handshake yet. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M

“Washington (CNN)There should be a rule in international diplomacy: No strange handshake rituals.

Why, you ask? I offer this as all the evidence you will ever need -- from the ongoing Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in the Philippines:

There's so much happening here -- all of it (or at least most of it) super awkward, with President Donald Trump right in the middle of it both literally and figuratively.
Let's go left to the right in the photo.

* Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha: He appears to be old hat at this sort of thing. No arm straining. Totally relaxed. Like's he's done the ""ASEAN-Way handshake"" -- as this move is called -- a thousand times before. That said, the look on his face definitely says, ""I am only tolerating this. Don't make the mistake of thinking I enjoy it.""
* Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev: The real hero of this photo. Medvedev has clearly been trained in the Vladimir Putin I-do-what-I-want-to-do-at-all-times school of international affairs. Medvedev is also smiling coolly, knowing that his decision not to play ball on the ""ASEAN-Way handshake"" was the right move.”

[앵커]
김주환 YTN 정치안보 전문기자 그리고 김열수 교수문제연구원 안보전략실장 그리고 홍현익 세종연구소 수석연구위원 나오셨습니다. 세 분 어서 오십시오.

[인터뷰]
안녕하십니까?

[앵커]
오늘 북한군 귀순 당시의 CCTV 영상이 아주 대대적으로 공개가 됐는데요. 이 영상을 저희가 먼저 보고 좀 얘기를 나눠보겠습니다.

영상을 좀 주시면요. 제가 먼저 상황을 조금 설명을 해 드리겠습니다.

오늘 보면 북한군 병사가 넘어올 때 굉장히 차를 타고 빠른 속도로. 저기가 72시간의 다리다 이렇게 알려져 있는데요. 지금 굉장히 빠른 속도로 이동하는 그런 모습을 보실 수 있습니다.

지금 시간이 화면 하단에 나오고 있는데요. 이때가 3시 13분, 북한 귀순 병사가 차량을 통해서 이동하는 모습을 저희가 볼 수 있고요.

여기서 보면 김일성 동상 부분을 지나칩니다. 여기가 북한의 공동경비구역 투어가 시작되는 곳이라고 하는데 여기를 지나쳐서 지금 우회전을 급하게 하는 모습도 지금 확인할 수 있습니다.

지금 보면 우회전 하는 모습을 보실 수가 있는데요. 대한민국으로 넘어오기 위한 의도를 가지고 급하게 우회전 하는 모습 볼 수 있고 저 나무 아래에 차량이 더 이상 이동할 수 없는 그런 상황이 펼쳐지고 있는 상황이고요.

북한군, 굉장히 급해졌습니다. 놀란 북한군이 공동경비구역 병사들이 차량이 정차한 지점을 향해서 지금 빠른 속도로 달려가고 있는 그런 모습인데요. 일부 북한군 병사들, 초소에서도 뛰어나오고 또 다른 일부 병사들은 판문각 계단에서 뛰어나오는 이런 모습이 보입니다. 이미 무장은 다 하고 내려온 그런 모습들을 확인할 수 있는데요.

다음 영상 주실까요. 가장 문제가 되는 부분인데요. 저 차량이 지금 장애물에 걸려서 넘어졌고 북한군 병사가 걸리니까 나와서 도망을 갑니다. 도주를 하는데 엎드려서 사격도 하고 사격을 하는 모습이 보이고 있고요.

지금 도주하는 모습이 영상에 담겼는데 굉장히 가까운 거리에서 사격이 이루어지고 있는 모습을 확인할 수 있습니다.

지금 보면 군사분계선을 넘었느냐 말았느냐 이게 굉장히 논란이었는데 지금 명확히 넘어온 모습도 확인하실 수 있습니다.

추격 후에 군사분계선을 몇 초 정도 넘었다가 다시 북쪽으... (중략)

Roller coasters are pretty neat, I must say.  But they rely on passive vehicles holding fragile humans while zooming around at high speeds.  That can be a tough thing to manage safely, but it's not impossible.  This video shows you a few ways it's done.
