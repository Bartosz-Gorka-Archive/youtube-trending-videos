[Intro: DRAM]
I must've been, babe
Ooh, babe, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Dave 1]
One hit of you, I went through the roof
Your love's so strong, that's a hundred proof
Too much of you, I ain't drivin' home
No, I ain't spendin' the night alone

[Pre-Chorus: Dave 1]
All this lyin' got me stressin'
Tell me why you keep me guessin'
I wish I'd have learned my lesson
But I wanted you, yeah, I wanted you

[Chorus: DRAM & Dave 1]
I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
Now I'm just tryin' to forget you
I must've been, I must've been
I must've been high when I met you (met you)
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

[Post-Chorus: Dave 1 & P Thugg]
High
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high

[Verse 2: DRAM]
Could be Mary, could be Molly, could be you
Y'all girls got me in a trance
Hypnotized, can't wake up
Fantasizing, could be Christina or Lucy
Can't believe this how y'all do me
You only call me to use me and abuse me

[Pre-Chorus: Dave 1]
All this lyin' got me stressin'
Tell me why you keep me guessin'
I wish I'd have learned my lesson
But I wanted you, yeah, I wanted you

[Chorus: DRAM & Dave 1]
I must've been high when I met you (met you)
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
Now I'm just tryin' to forget you (forget you)
I must've been, I must've been
I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

[Post-Chorus: DRAM, Dave 1 & P Thugg]
High
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high
High when I met you

[Bridge: Dave 1]
I'm comin' down like a flight of stairs
I guess I'm finally seein' clear
I know I promised I wouldn't call
I guess I'm just goin' through withdrawal

[Chorus: Dave 1 & DRAM]
I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

[Post-Chorus: DRAM, Dave 1 & P Thugg]
High
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've, must've been

INGREDIENTS
Baked Ham
Eggs
Green Food Coloring
Cooking oil

To prepare your ham, submerge it in a pot of water and mix food coloring. The ham will soak up the color over the course of 30-45 minutes.

To prepare your eggs, crack your eggs and separate the yolks from the egg whites in two separate containers. In a ramekin or small bowl, pour water and mix in green food coloring. Add your yolk into the food coloring mixture and let soak for 10-15 minutes. Remove carefully with a sieve, blotting away any excess liquid.

Heat a pot with oil across the bottom on medium heat. Pour a small amount of eggwhites on top to make the base of the egg, then add your green egg yolk on top. It will help to have one hand on the pot handle at all times so you can control where the egg whites and egg yolk move when adding them.

Once the bottom of the egg white is browned, remove the egg from the pan and continue cooking more if desired.

When your ham is colored, drain the water and dry excess liquid. Place in an oven at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes just to warm it up, remove, then serve with your eggs!

in the land of the free-er...
evidence, it's no use.

I've been bathing in the blood of our success
I guess it is just the stubborn side of man
that can see a riot and then somehow think
there could actually be no good reason…

you wanna see what people are really like,
I'm not really sure you wanna be knowing

how could they say...
murder in the name of national security
-yo no sé
they say murder in the name of national security

and the silence in the way
and the silence in the way
-

evidence, it's no use…
this is just the life that's been chosen for me

yeah, well...
I've been sipping on the blood of sweet success
before history punishes us for it
you wanna see what, people are really like?
watch them light a torch.
understanding ends this game…

how could it be
murder in the name of officer security
-yo no sé
they say murder in the name of officer security

if I was batting I'd be right behind ya
it's not the first time, that I've been lied to
all wordz are made up - before I was born
my friend the walls say only they'll keep me warm
you know it - lies are comforting,
bye bye -bye bye
you know it - obliviousness… I'll leave it in my dreams ...my dreams.
you know it, on my own, sitting down right here.

I wanted it, murder in the name of personal security.
-yo no sé
yes I'm going out tonite just don't wanna be fooled again...

(we all) play those mind games and we stay unaware
not angels, not fiends, but just human beings

...work so hard to become a vague memory in the mind of a collective group of strangers.
leaving all my melodies behind

It has been a long time since I've been this proud of a cover.

And for those who know me, I don't normally say anything prideful, but I am just so freaking happy (no pun intended) with how this cover turned out. Big thanks to Brandon (SixteenInMono) for creating the best instrumental of this song on the internet. 

I hope y'all enjoy this one a whole lot and let me know what you think below! Should I do more Fairy Tail? Here's hoping the guild turns out for this one ;)

Peace, love and metal \m/ ♥


English lyrics adapted by Caleb Hyles:

This talk of destiny and where I belong’s been fed to me now for too long
The pursuit of a purpose for my life has left me dead inside.
We talk so casually about how “it’s fate”, but when did I give fate the control?
No one’s taking my future away, that is something saved for you!

Bring it on! cuz I'm jus gonna grow up in the battle HEY!! buchinuku donten! 
Still burning my fire ten wo kirsaku raimei I gotta kakikesu Nightmare tada mirai ga mitakute! 
Kako, mirai, soshite ikiteru ima, I ain't scared of my past and now for takusareta asu 
Screaming out for my pride!!

With all the pain inside of me, the tears I could never let you see, I know
(I’m never falling down, cause I know that there’s no such thing as Destiny)
This smile is fragile, incomplete. Hidden away for none to see, you know
(I gotta blast off the pain for you and me! Tell the darkness to rest in peace!)
It’s time to strike!!

It breaks my heart to tell you that I’m a fake. And that this confidence I show,
Cannot take another hit or it all will then begin to fall. 
I’m rational and grounded in my resolve, but when my reality dissolves 
I must fight for tomorrow so that I can share this dream with you!

Rally the troops, gather round, tell the soldiers “follow me now”. Don’t you ever stop! We’ll pay them back in spades now. For taking mine (and taking yours) rewind the lies as it plays back. 
Don’t try to (control me) you’ll find this beast impossible to tame.
 Struggle, sorrow, They'll disappear like bubbles
But this flame in my heart is like an ever-burning candle.
Screaming out for your pride!

I take on all the agony, if it means we can both be free, let’s go!
(Nobody can blow out my fire, you and I, never knowing how high we will climb)
No more living to hesitate. I won’t lose sight along the way, my goal! 
(Don’t blind your eyes, if you’re lost on the way! Trust in me now, I will be your light!)
So take my hands!!

I live for this sh-

(Papercut break)

With all the pain inside of me, the tears I could never let you see, I know
(I’m never falling down, cause I know that there’s no such thing as Destiny)
This smile is fragile, incomplete. Hidden away for none to see, you know
(I gotta blast off the pain for you and me! Tell the darkness to rest in peace!)

Kokoro wo moyashite, terashi tsudzukeru yo zutto..
(Nobody can blow out my fire kesenai! koeru hai i ro no sekai!) 
Mayowana i yo wo ni, miushinawana i yo ni zutto.. 
(Don't blind your eyes, if you're lost on the way! kamawanai I'm gonna be your light!) 
So take my hand!!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DKhtw2WzZ8M/sddefault.jpg,0.015022169173334715,0.0002440717327633461,61.54817275747509,0.0010443999727547833,0.015266240906098063,0.016310640878852846,2017-11-18,18:30:00,Saturday,5,12,73,11,22,64,473,6,61,3,0,7,0,0,0,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.556070577096005,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Their film, ""The Big Sick,"" proved to be a critical success, and has now earned them an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes"" meets with Nanjiani and Gordon to find out how telling the story of their lives has turned their lives upside-down.

Check out the series on new safety features: http://ve42.co/MB
This video is sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, who invited me to come to Stuttgart to see their latest cars, crash test facilities and experience the innovations they are working on.

Physics is something that is directly applicable to car safety. Cars go fast, but they also sometimes collide with obstacles, which brings them to a sudden stop, subjecting the car and occupants to very high accelerations, which can cause injury or death. So the major idea to improve car safety is to reduce these accelerations and there are a number of ways to do this:

Passive safety:

Seat belts: keep passengers in the vehicle, preventing them from continuing with constant velocity, flying through the windshield and suffering a worse deceleration when they make contact with the road.

Crumple zones: increase the distance over which deceleration occurs, thereby reducing peak magnitude of deceleration.

Air bags: increase the distance over which the head decelerates, again reducing peak magnitude of deceleration of the head.

Active Safety:
Anti-lock braking system: rather than 'locking' the wheels as can happen if you slam on the brakes with a traditional braking system leading to the tires skidding across the road, ABS attempts to control the amount of braking so that the tires always roll with static friction in contact with the road. This increases the backward frictional force that can be applied to the tires, again increasing the distance over which deceleration occurs, and it gives the driver an opportunity to steer to avoid the collision (hence why it's referred to as an active safety system).

Special thanks to Mercedes for having me visit facilities in Stuttgart. I had a lot of fun making these videos so please do check out the series on Mercedes Benz's channel: http://ve42.co/MB

It feels like we’ve been searching for a boat forever! In this episode we finally buy a boat, a beautiful Tartan 37.

Before we find the Tartan, we look at two other options in the Milwaukee area: a Pearson 38 and a Southerly 35. The Pearson had been left on the hard for about five years, and the neglect shows. While the swing keel is a cool concept on the Southerly, this boat came with too much extra stuff (resulting in a higher price tag) that we didn’t need.

We just know this Tartan is our boat. But how? They say you get a feeling, and even though we thought we had felt it before, this time is different. It helps that the buying experience unfolds without any drama (unlike our previous efforts to buy: i.e. a seller deciding he didn’t want to sell, another seller unable to finish work prior to closing). Lastly, the sellers of the Tartan have clearly doted on their boat — its condition is immaculate.

The day of the survey starts with sunny skies and light winds. Just as the sellers are preparing the boat for the sea trial, a cold front moves in. The skies greys over and the winds start gusting. Both sails are raised, but only the 150% genoa is reefed slightly. During a tack, a jib sheet gets away, and the other jib sheet gets caught on a winch. Both Kirk and I are glad we can experience how the boat handles in stronger winds.

And then, it’s closing day! We turn over our boat nest-egg, sign the papers, and receive the keys to our new floating home. Hell yeah!

Hope you enjoy!
Lauren & Kirk

Indonesian food is one of the world's greatest cuisines. In this ultimate guide, you'll discover 50 of the best Indonesian dishes you don't want to miss!

Why is Indonesian food so delicious?

As I was about to dig into a plate of Nasi Sunda or Nasi Bandung, Nasi Padang, a nice man sitting at the table next to me said:

“It’s because Indonesian food is based on fresh spices and herbs.”

And when you and I look at the list of food below, and notice the fresh herbs and multitude of spices used in Indonesian cooking, it truly is a huge contributing factor as to why Indonesian cuisine is so flavorful and exciting to eat.

In this blog post I’m going to share with you 50 incredibly delicious Indonesian foods. Get ready for a serious Indonesian culinary journey!

Before we get watched, I just want to make it clear that this is not an exhaustive or complete list of food in Indonesia (there are thousands of Indonesian dishes), but it’s a definite start to discovering the incredible cuisine of Indonesia. Some of the foods I included, such as durian and petai, are simply because I love them so much.

For each of the dishes listed in this Indonesian food guide I’ve included the dish, and if possible, the restaurant where I ate it in Jakarta (you may also be interested in my Jakarta travel guide).
Food is the reason you should travel!

Before we jump into the tweets in discussion though – it’s important to point out that Ed was in amazing company in this category. The women he beat included Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, Lady Gaga and Pink – so basically all of music’s biggest legends. And here’s the kicker, as I mentioned, Ed wasn’t even at the Grammys to accept the award. But this isn’t new news – his manager tweeted out last month to let the world know Ed wouldn’t be attending. But back to the twitterverse for a moment – Ira Madison III tweeted out: I guess it’s a good thing Kesha didn’t win over Ed Sheeran, since the music industry doesn’t seem to care about examining its abuses of power. Rawan tweeted out this zinger: how dare you snub kesha in favor of a glorified wedding singer. YIKES. Okay I think he’s a pretty awesome singer but there was a ton of support for Kesha in particular, with Marc tweeting: ""Ed Sheeran"" is a hell of a way to mispronounce ""Kesha."" The tweets were aplenty – Ed hasn’t responded to the tweets but he’s been pretty under the radar since news broke that he’s engaged to his longtime girlfriend. So guys, I”ve gotta know – are you upset that Ed Sheeran took home the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance? If so, who do you think should’ve nabbed the trophy? Hit the comments to join the conversation and then click here to see Pink slay her performance – is there anything this woman isn’t good at? I’m obsessed. Thanks for hanign out with us on Clevver News – I’m your girl Joslyn Davis we’ll catch you later!

[THE BOYZ(더보이즈)]

THE BOYZ, who made its grand debut with a strong goal to become ‘the only boys’ winning the hearts of the public, released its mini album ‘THE START’ and a new song titled ‘Giddy Up’ to begin the new year of 2018 with full of energy.
If its debut album ‘THE FIRST’ was the first step to the world, this album ‘THE START’ is THE BOYZ’s dash starting the race beyond the starting line.
The title track ‘Giddy Up’ describes the message of THE BOYZ not to stop but to run forward no matter what will happen with the unique bright and energetic charms. It shows the hopeful dash of the boys who returned as fresh and energetic boys.

When Muli, a wild tiger in Sumatra, is rescued by the Tambling Wildlife Nature Conservation, she brings together scientists, conservationists and poachers in this story of survival. Muli is one of 400 Sumatran Tigers left in the world. The entire tiger population is on the brink of extinction because of poachers who sell their skins and bones, and the illegal market which consumes them.

Every school child across the globe knows the tiger, and yet we are causing the most iconic animal in the world to go extinct. We need tigers for a healthy stable world for us and future generations.
 
Panthera is on the front lines, standing between poachers and tigers.  In partnerships on the ground with local governments, law enforcement, and NGOs, they are focused on anti-poaching efforts to ensure that we will have wild tigers forever.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

►Dota 2 is played in matches between two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold in a corner of the playing field.

[Joe] Meeting some of Alena’s extended family members was really a nice experience. I had a better framing in my mind of how and why my wife is the way she is. One notable thing is that the women in her lineage are all very strong-willed. They all seem to have a strong sense of what is important to them. The strong bonding of family and home was a common trait that resonated with each of them, that no matter how distant or disdaining a family member became, they still had each other’s back at the end of the day. Also, the provisions of having a “home base” that everyone could come back to was also something I noticed that was different than my own relations to my family. Even including some of the wildly dysfunctional stories I heard over the few days while visiting, I’d rather have stories to tell to my kids of how crazy this family member was, or how funny this situation was, or how this person went in and out of jail… because then at least there is a history that is recorded. My parents seem to keep most of the history to themselves. 

Psalm 78:3-4 
Things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.

ABOUT MARRIED TO MEDICINE:
""Married to Medicine"" season five premieres on Sunday, November 5 at 10pm ET/PT with returning ladies Toya Bush-Harris, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Dr. Jacqueline Walters, Quad Webb-Lunceford, Dr. Simone Whitmore, Mariah Huq who also welcome new cast member Dr. Contessa Metcalfe. Dr. Jackie is busier than ever with a top medical practice and new book, but she also has to come to terms with the harsh reality that her husband, Curtis, has been unfaithful. Dr. Simone is still living the life in her north and south homes, but has the stress of commuting between both put a strain on her marriage and kids? Toya is reflecting on life in a different way, which places her at odds with Eugene, who is working overtime and not making enough time for some much needed TLC. Meanwhile, Dr. Heavenly has expanded her dentistry practice and is continuing her spiritual journey to get away from conflict, but somehow drama still follows her like a magnet. Quad is a doctor's wife of all trades but when it comes to Dr. G, she is not feeling the love for all of her hard work and this causes a rift in their marriage. The newest addition, Dr. Contessa Metcalfe, is a wife, mother and business owner, and has come to a crossroads where she's ready to leave medicine behind and focus on her husband and three kids. With a new lady in the mix, multiple relationship woes and personal struggles, will the women be able to mend their friendships and move forward in their lives?

i hope you enjoyed rummaging through my backpack~ i'm a much simpler packer these days, necessary items only!

i'm currently home in texas, which is very nice. the weather is cool and i keep running into familiar faces everywhere i go. a true small town, one i've memorized and built memories in my entire childhood. it's perfect and i am so so pleased to be back.

i'm sitting in a cafe, as always. i've watched people come and go all day, and it's incredible, because almost every face i'd seen atleast once before. so different from the big city. better? not sure, i kinda like the anonymity of the city these days.

thank you for watching these silly videos. it dumbfounds me every day. every once in a while i'll step back and realize there are many more of you than live in my hometown and it makes me heart beat very fast. thank you, truly.

i'll see you again in a couple days!

much love,

-cone

Scrubs. 
Ever since I started my medical training in 2007 all of my friends have been telling me that I MUST watch the TV show Scrubs but for some reason, I was always a little hesitant to start it. Maybe because I looked at medicine as a serious field, it didn't make sense to watch a comedy about it.

Well, now I am taking your advice and watching the first episode ever of the medical drama. Although I think this show is less of a medical drama is more of a medical comedy or satire. I can see why many medical professionals enjoy this show because working many hours in the hospital system can leave you feeling frustrated at times,

Now, as far as my opinion goes I have to be honest. This show is not as appealing to me as it is for most of my friends. I feel like they take easy shots at medicine and exaggerate a lot for the sake of humor (especially Zach Braff ) Not sure why, but the humor didn't land for me that often. I also think I would probably need to watch a few more episodes as the pilot is rarely the best one. Also, Zach Braff irritates me just a little a bit in his acting.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches Scrubs / Real Doctor Reacts to Scrubs. If you want me to continue making this medical drama review series please like the video and leave me a comment on which tv drama show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder.  Trolls World Tour premieres at home April 10. www.watchtrolls.com #TrollsWorldTour

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically, I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

To make this Girl Scout Cookie Cake I baked my delicious Coconut Cake,  which I covered with Caramel Italian Meringue Buttercream,  coconut caramel filling, and chocolate ganache then, I stacked Samoa Cookies and it is ready to take on the world!

DZZyKCplfXo,thIRJLsnIxY,New US envoy to Netherlands grilled over 2015 comments,AP Archive,25.0,2018-01-15 15:21:44+00:00,"['AP Archive', '4134209', '6ffd62c8f629074a2a979cd87fceb23b', 'Netherlands US Ambassador', 'Peter Hoekstra', 'Netherlands', 'Western Europe', 'The Hague', 'Media', 'Government and politics', 'Arts and entertainment']",9238.0,96.0,0.0,18.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DZZyKCplfXo/default.jpg,"(10 Jan 2018) The new US ambassador to the Netherlands clashed Wednesday with Dutch reporters on his first official day in the job over controversial comments he made in 2015. 
Hoekstra previously claimed that the ""Islamic movement"" was creating chaos in Europe and suggested that extremists were burning politicians and cars in the Netherlands.
At a news conference shortly after presenting his credentials to Dutch King Willem-Alexander at a palace in The Hague, Pete Hoekstra was repeatedly asked about the comments he made at a 2015 conference, which made headlines last year when he described his own words to a Dutch reporter as fake news. 
Hoekstra later denied using the phrase fake news.
In a statement last year, Hoekstra said: ""I made certain remarks in 2015 and regret the exchange during the Nieuwsuur interview. Please accept my apology.""
On Wednesday, Hoekstra referred back to that statement and said he didn't want to revisit the issue - but that did not stop Dutch reporters from pressing unsuccessfully for a clarification.
Dutch reporters reacted angrily, with one saying ""this is the Netherlands; you have to answer questions"". 
Another asked if the ambassador could name a politician who had been burned in recent years.
Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, was born in the northern Dutch city of Groningen before his family emigrated to the United States. 
He previously served as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and was the ranking Republican on the Committee until 2011.
He told reporters he would work to build on existing strong links between the Netherlands and the United States.

Thank you to my current patrons for helping me cross my first milestone! 

The Harry Potter novels are excellent mystery stories. In this episode, I take a look at a handful of the techniques J.K. Rowling uses to successfully hide clues throughout the novels so that the reader always has a chance of successfully solving the mystery themselves.

동영상을 통해서 지금 저기에 보이는 노란 부분 있죠. 저 부분이 폭 50cm, 높이 5cm짜리예요. 거기에서 사실상 MDL을 쭉 한 500m 정도 되는 곳을 저렇게 해 놓은 거거든요.

그러니까 저것이 사실상 군사분계선의 표시로 저렇게 해 놓은 건데 지금 동영상에서 보셨다시피 잠시 넘어왔다가 다시 돌아갔기 때문에 이것은 정전협정의 위반에 해당이 됩니다.

◆앵커] 그렇군요. 두 가지가 정전협정 위반이라는 거 아니겠습니까. 지금 이 군사분계선을 넘어온 것 하나하고 그다음에 군사분계선을 넘어온 북한군 병사를 향해서 지금 사격을 했다는 말이죠. 이 두 가지가 정전협정 위반이다, 오늘 이 발표를 명확히 하지 않았습니까?

◇기자] 지금 건물에서 넘어왔다가 몇 초인가 머뭇거리다가 당시 누군가가 자신들 쪽에서 소리를 쳤겠죠, 되돌아오라는 등. 그래서 머뭇거리다가 넘어갔고요.

그리고 군사분계선 너머에 JSA가 생긴 이후 두 번째 교전 상황이 벌어진 거죠. 1984년도에 소련 관광객이 넘어올 때, 그때는 몇 명의 사상자도 있었습니다. 그리고 한 30여년 만에 처음으로 이런 일이 벌어졌는데 그리고 총탄이 박혔고요.

""שמעתי היום את טענתו של הנשיא רוחאני שישראל עומדת מאחורי ההפגנות באיראן. לא רק שזה שקר. זה נלעג. שלא כמו רוחאני, אני לא אעליב את העם האיראני. מגיע להם יותר. איראנים אמיצים נוהרים לרחובות. הם חותרים לחופש, לצדק, לחירויות הבסיסיות שנשללו מהם במשך עשרות שנים. 

המשטר האכזרי באיראן מוציא עשרות מיליארדי דולרים על הפצת שנאה. הכסף הזה יכול היה לשמש לבניית בתי ספר או בתי חולים. אין זה פלא שאבות ואמהות צועדים ברחובות. המשטר פוחד מהם, מעמו שלו. זאת הסיבה שהם כולאים סטודנטים. זאת הסיבה שהם אוסרים על רשתות חברתיות. אולם אני משוכנע שהפחד לא ינצח. כיוון שהעם האיראני הוא חכם, מתוחכם וגאה. היום, הוא מסכן הכל למען החופש.

למרבה הצער, ממשלות אירופיות רבות שותקות למראה הכאתם של גיבורים איראנים צעירים ברחובות. זה פשוט לא צודק. אני, לעומת זאת, אינני מתכוון לשתוק. 

משטר זה מנסה נואשות לזרוע שנאה בינינו. אולם הוא לא יצליח.

וכשהמשטר סוף סוף ייפול, ויום אחד זה יקרה, האיראנים והישראלים יחזרו להיות חברים טובים. אני מאחל לעם האיראני הצלחה בחתירתו הנאצלת לחירות.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DaPTO8fwuno/sddefault.jpg,0.01905617275513989,0.005486459573969579,3.4733096085409247,0.007497510592186188,0.024542632329109474,0.032040142921295665,2018-01-01,15:54:35,Monday,0,12,1,12,1,66,2,0,2,1,0,2,0,5,0,5.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.208562681434727,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",4

MTB IN MALAGA IS SICK! For the 3rd episode of the bangers tour series we headed to Malaga, spain in search of epicness!

Malaga is famous for BMX street riding and awesome skateparks, but there are also some really sick dirt jumps and Downhill trails too so we decided to stay with the RoostDH crew and they showed us some great spots.

We visited street, dirt jumps, skatepark, downhill and freeride spots. Malaga really has a lot to offer when it comes to biking so it was an obvious choice for this episode of the bangers tour series! 

Along for the ride was Tom Cardy and Chris Smith which helped to give a good variety of riding styles.

If you want to visit Malaga and need a guide I'd advise you check out the crew over at RoostDH.

Thanks to: Monster Energy, GoPro and Continental for making it possible.

Hope you enjoy it!!

About Teen Titans GO!: 
TEEN TITANS GO! is a comedy featuring the beloved DC heroes seen in a skewed light. They still fight crime and face classic villains, but mainly deal with all the issues of five teens rooming together -- chores, romantic tension, demon dad drop-ins and impromptu meatball parties.  They also dance! The emphasis is on the odd everyday life of super heroes who haven't grown up.

Lyrics - 

Men these days have it so damn hard
They cant be authentically who they are
Because their manhood is being threatened and it’s gone too far

It was a beautiful sunny day so I decided to buy a cupcake
But suddenly the day went from great to bad when the man front of me got very mad
See, they only had pink cupcakes, and the man in front of me said hey, “I can’t have a pink one, I’m a boy!”

His manhood was being threatened! How disrespectful and it is totally rational and logical to let a color decide if you’re a man.
Not how you treat a woman, or how mature you are. Not by your character or how you’ve lived your life so far- oh, no. the color on your cupcake is definitely what makes you man.

I heard an interview recently where the host said he hates rainbow emojis
cause that emoji’s only for girls and gays, and he is a man and he’s totally straight
Cuz a dumb little cartoon that you use in texts is definitely what determines your sex… right?

His manhood was being threatened! How disrespectful and it is totally rational and logical to let an emoji decide if you’re a man.
Not how you treat a woman, or how mature you are. Not by your character or how you’ve lived your life so far- oh, no. the emoji you use is definitely what makes you man.

These poor men! I feel so bad for them. Can you even imagine being so fragile and immature that a color or emoji would make you so insecure? Can’t relate…

I dated this guy a long time ago he was a bit of a male chauvinist though
I let it slide cuz well, boys will be boys! Who cares if my opinions always made him annoyed?
But one day I made dinner and he raised hell cuz I sat at the head of the table…
True story.

His manhood was being threatened! How disrespectful and it is totally rational and logical to let a seat decide if you’re a man.
Not how you treat a woman, or how mature you are. Not by your character or how you’ve lived your life so far- oh, no. What seat you sit in, what emoji you use, what color your cupcake is, is definitely what makes you a man!

About 450 people were killed and close to 8,000 injured when the quake hit near the Iran-Iraq border on Sunday.
The government is scrambling to get aid to the worst-hit Kermanshah province, where hundreds of homes were destroyed.
President Hassan Rouhani, visiting the region, said state-built houses suffered more damage, and those responsible would be held accountable.
Night-time temperatures in Kermanshah province fell close to freezing for the second night in succession.

So much for easing back into the action. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr planned to limit his star guard’s minutes Saturday night against the Memphis Grizzlies in his first game back from an ankle injury.
And he did. It’s what Curry did with those minutes in a 141-128 win over the Memphis Grizzlies that was extraordinary.
Steph showed up fresh off a three-week-long layoff to post 38 points with 4 rebounds and 3 assists on 10-of-13 shooting from behind the arc.
And he did it all in less than 26 minutes.

De9uhg1sgkU,qDDNcyOhqCI,Black Panther Interview: Michael B. Jordan on Creating Erik Killmonger’s Backstory,Collider,24.0,2018-02-21 23:03:55+00:00,"['tobeornottobethatisthequestion', 'Erik Killmonger', 'Killmonger', 'Black Panther', 'Michael B. Jordan', 'Ryan Coogler', 'Video Interview', 'Marvel', 'Marvel Studios']",33099.0,1011.0,18.0,98.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De9uhg1sgkU/default.jpg,"Watch our interview with Michael B. Jordan for Black Panther where he talks about creating Erik Killmonger’s backstory and what’s special about a Ryan Coogler film.

I think we can all agree the antagonists of the Marvel Universe have been a weak link in an otherwise amazing film series. All too often, it feels like the villain is an afterthought, and whatever plan they have hasn’t been fully developed. Of course that’s not always the case, because most people love Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Michael Keaton in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Daniel Bruhl’s villainous Helmut Zemo in Captain America: Civil War, and Robert Redford’s Alexander Pierce along with Sebastian Stan’s Bucky in Captain America: The Winter Solider. But for a film universe made up of over twenty movies, you’d be hard pressed to name more than a few other antagonists that were really well written.

Enter Black Panther director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan with Erik Killmonger.

While the entire movie is well done and tells a great story that people have flocked to around the world, I’d argue one of the main reasons the movie works so well is the way Coogler and Black Panther co-writer Joe Robert Cole wrote Erik Killmonger. Without getting into spoilers for people that haven’t seen it, the way Killmonger is written and portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, you completely understand why he is acting the way he does, and why he wants to get revenge for what’s been done to him. He’s written as a three dimensional character that makes some great points, he just goes too far in trying to achieve his goals. Trust me, when you see Black Panther, I’m beyond confident you’ll walk away thinking Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger was one of the highlights of the film.

At the recent Los Angeles press day for Black Panther, we got to sit down with Michael B. Jordan for an exclusive video interview. He talked about how they created his character, how the film touches on what’s happening in our world without it feeling forced or like it’s preaching, How they wanted people to understand Killmonger’s point of view, what’s special about a Ryan Coogler film, and more.

As everyone that reads Collider knows, written by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, the film stars Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa/Black Panther (first introduced in Captain America: Civil War), who returns home to the isolated and advanced nation of Wakanda in the wake of his father’s death to assume his rightful place as king. Matters are complicated when his place on the throne is put into question. Black Panther also stars Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Andy Serkis.

De_Dezrdpgo,bU-vnDmxd1Q,How Jay-Z And Diddy Made Millions Off Of 'Cheap Grapes',Business Insider,25.0,2018-03-13 19:00:00+00:00,"['Business Insider', 'Forbes', 'Diddy', 'Jay-Z', 'Hip-Hop', 'Hip-Hop Moguls', 'P. Diddy', 'Spirits', 'Alcohol', 'Cognac', 'Ciroc', 'Vodka']",923527.0,10289.0,665.0,779.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De_Dezrdpgo/default.jpg,"Zack O'Malley Greenburg, author of 3 Kings: Diddy, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, and Hip-Hop's Multibillion-Dollar Rise discusses how hip hop moguls, Jay-Z and Diddy, leveraged their fame to create two million-dollar brands. Following is a transcript of the video.

Zack O'Malley Greenburg: Just goes to show how you can leverage your fame beyond just the music.

About a decade ago The Economist interviewed the director of the company that makes Cristal Champagne, one of the most expensive champagnes in the world favored by Russian tsars over history, he was asked, what did he think about all these rappers drinking Cristal Champagne and he basically said, ""Well, we can't forbid ""people from buying it."" Not exactly a ringing endorsement of a new customer base. He thought that rappers didn't read The Economist but he was wrong. Jay-Z heard about his comments, he removed it from his 40/40 Club, and more importantly he started issuing this sort of, directive to his fans, not to drink it either.

And instead of rapping about Cristal, he put his money where is mouth was, he ended up investing in, and eventually taking over French champagne brand called Armand de Brignac, AKA Ace of Spades. You see this in his videos, the gold bottles, he raps about it all the time, and this has now become one of his most valuable assets in his entire portfolio.

Diddy does not have his own champagne, however he has something just as or perhaps even more valuable, which is his deal with Diageo's Ciroc vodka. He started out with them in the late 2000s, and at that point, Ciroc was just a middling vodka brand being shilled by no-name former NFL players. They decided to take a chance on Diddy, and they didn't really have anything to lose, because Ciroc wasn't doing very well. It was about the fiftieth ranked vodka in the world and so Diddy came on and he applied his typical marketing panache and his shock and awe salesmanship, this was around the time that Barack Obama was running for president. He started calling himself Ciroc Obama, giving that free product placement, within only a few years, Ciroc was number two in the premium vodka category, to only Grey Goose doin' about two million cases a year.

There's a really fascinating connection between Diddy and Jay-Z in the spirits world. Between the two of them, I mean you think, you know same job description, hip hop mogul, two very different guys, two very different approaches. But born a month apart, in the same city, both named Shawn and they both use the same cheap grape as the base of two of their most important products, that's the Trebbiano grape, which is considered by wine officials to be, you know sort of a, a nothing grape, it's a filler, it's table wine.

Jay-Z has a Cognac called D'Usse, which is a joint venture with Bacardi. Of course, if you're making Cognac, it doesn't really matter because they're grapes that you have to include in order to be officially called Cognac. As far as Diddy's Ciroc vodka goes, using grapes is rather unorthodox, vodka is typically made out of potatoes or grains or something like that. So that was kind of his first philosophy with Ciroc is to center on the sexiness of the grape.

Diddy: One-and-a-half ounces of Ciroc vodka, you can only make it with Ciroc vodka, other vodkas don't work.

Greenburg: One thing that gets kind of lost in all of the promotion of Ciroc and such, is that Trebbiano is actually a very cheap grape and not some super-fancy thing.

At the end of the day, Jay-Z and Diddy are both excellent, savvy businessmen. Of course they're not gonna get the most expensive grape because in order to do well on a product, you have to have a low cost, and you have to have a high price. They've grasped that better than anybody and the success that they've had with Ciroc and D'Usse certainly go to prove that as well.

This was an INCREDIBLY difficult list to coordinate and edit. I have loved this show since forever, and always thought it was robbed of Best Comedy Series (not just the nominations, but the wins). If I left off a favorite episode, forgive me! Seasons 1-6 truly are brilliant, so much was considered. Seasons 7-9 began to fade, but a few gems still remain. Enjoy! #roseanne2018 #roseanne #jasonmovieguy

He is questioned on whether he feels fear or loneliness in his position, as well as his own feelings on his adequacy as a leader of the civil rights movement in America.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Df673OJ7o0A/sddefault.jpg,0.017683858679695557,0.00017314974441592074,102.1304347826087,0.0004968644839761204,0.017857008424111483,0.0183538729080876,2018-03-14,08:35:01,Wednesday,2,10,39,10,34,62,346,1,79,0,1,9,18,0,0,5.0,8.0,"['ns —', 'eau', 'eo']","['ns', '—', 'eau', 'eo']",True,"['ns', '—', 'eau', 'eo']",4,4,8,0,0,0,0,6.2017472729084515,2,"['happy', 'angry']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Plot Summary
Human child Mowgli is raised by a wolf pack in the jungles of India. As he learns the often harsh rules of the jungle, under the tutelage of a bear named Baloo and a panther named Bagheera, Mowgli becomes accepted by the animals of the jungle as one of their own, but the fearsome tiger Shere Khan doesn't take a liking to him. But there may be greater dangers lurking in the jungle, as Mowgli comes face to face with his human origins.

Letra:
[Aretuza Lovi]
Tô chegando
Se prepara pra jogar
Vittar, Gloria Groove, A-re-tuza

Ela joga a bunda, ela é quem comanda
Tem carta na manga, dos passinhos ela manja
Chega de mironga, com a sua ganga
Brota no rolê com as mina perigosa à pampa

Ela para e manda quadradinho e panda
Faz um movimento no ritmo ragatanga
Filha de um bom samba, rainha da granja
Os galinhas perde porque ela não dá canja

Ela prepara (para)
Roda (roda)
Trava (trava)
E joga

Ela prepara (para)
Roda (roda)
Trava (trava)
E joga

Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda
Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda

Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda
Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda, bunda

(Bunda, bunda, bunda)

[Pabllo Vittar]
Vem cá, sente o movimento se quiser jogar
Chega no talento se quiser sarrar, dançar
Quem tá convocando é a Queen Vittar

Sente o clima aqui
Vem sarrar de lado
Tá babado!

Ela prepara (para)
Roda (roda)
Trava (trava)
E joga

Ela prepara (para)
Roda (roda)
Trava (trava)
E joga

Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda
Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda

Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda
Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda, bunda

[Gloria Groove]
Se a Aretuza convocou, a bunda eu vou jogar
Esse momento é meu, bee, eu não vou deitar
Um close de beleza, isso era de se esperar
O que eles não esperavam é Lovi, Groove e Vittar

Pra não perder o costume, eu já passei no mercadinho
Pode aumentar o som, que eu vou ficar mais um pouquinho
Arê, com GG e PV, se acostuma, bebê
Senão vai passar mal com o nosso proceder

Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda
Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda

Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda
Ela joga a bunda, ela joga a bunda
Ela joga-joga-jo-joga-jo-joga a bunda, bunda",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DhIxpJHOeEo/sddefault.jpg,0.015761091851804056,0.0011851845684556488,13.298428170003511,0.0009274475133291633,0.016946276420259702,0.017873723933588867,2018-01-19,14:00:02,Friday,4,11,70,11,35,71,487,5,61,0,0,10,7,0,1,6.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.8894853914877565,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'umbrella': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Whenever I'm home in Michigan, I hear my nieces & nephews say the funniest things - so I decided to spend an afternoon asking them their thoughts on all things Holidays - from the meaning of Christmas, how Santa delivers all of those toys on one night and what you really drink for that New Year's Eve toast. Laugh along and comment below with the funniest thing you've heard a kid say about the holidays!

Y’all, the guest list was like, if the Grammys and Oscars put on a joint award show. That’s how Hollywood it got in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
‘Ye brought a pretty big piece of the Hollywood glitz and glam out to the countryside Thursday night for his album listening party. According to TMZ, the last-minute soiree was held at a ranch just outside Jackson Hole and attendees ranged from big name celebrities to reporter, as well as a few members from the music industry.
But, if you’re wondering just how fancy and exclusive a listening party in, well basically the middle of nowhere can get, just sit back, relax and let me tell you all the ways Kanye’s party gave us major fomo.
Number one: the star studded guest list. Of course, it goes without saying that ‘Ye’s wifey Kim Kardashian was there to support her man at the event but there were also a TON of major celebs who showed up to the exclusive party.
Everyone from Chris Rock to Jonah Hill, Scooter Braun, Nas, Fabolous, Kid Cudi, 2 Chainz, Ty Dolla Sign, Pusha T, Desiigner, Teyana Taylor – even Candace Owens came out to support Kanye and his new music. But, Candace showing up isn’t too surprising as Kanye did tweet in the past that he loves the way she thinks…
Anyway, back to the topic at hand. After hearing all of those names, did you really think the guest list for Kanye’s album listening party was going to be less than stellar? Yeah, me neither.
Aside from inviting some of Hollywood’s biggest stars to the party, the fact that these people were basically given a first listen to ‘Ye’s EIGHTH studio album made me pretty jelly. Sure, the album dropped at midnight for the rest of us plebs to listen to, but can you imagine just being in a room filled with some of the industry’s finest and listening to a brand new Kanye album? WHILST MINGLING WITH KANYE HIMSELF? AND KIM?
Yeah, maybe think about that a couple more times and then you’ll get to the level of saltiness that I’m at.
Who was the most surprising attendee to you? And do you wish you were there? Because I sure did. Anyway, let me know all your thoughts on this in the comment section below.

Mohammad bin Salman was designated as Saudi Arabia's new crown prince in June 2017. Since then, he has rapidly consolidated power and led Saudi Arabia towards some progressive reforms, such as granting women the right to drive. He also has plans to privatize certain segments of the economy, with the goal of reducing Saudi Arabia's economic dependency on oil. These changes, along with a suppression of Saudi Arabia's religious Right, could potentially begin to destabilize one of the Middle East's most powerful nations.

Lyrics:
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

#BumblebeeMovie

Bumblebee movie trailer breakdown. Is this the official robot cast and does Bee posses a new mode? trailer 2018, youtube bumblebee movie, story, movie details, history, origins explained. Whats up guys, RBG here. Hitting you guys up with news regarding the new Transformers Bumblebee solo film. And the latest news comes curtousy of TFW2005. And I gotta admit this is some pretty satisfying news because apparently IDW is coming out with a prequal comic/novelization to the Bumblebee Movie. This is something that came wayy out of left field because we haven't gotten any spin-off comics regarding the live action movies since Dark of the Moon. I mean of coarse you could include the Titan Magazines but those weren't necessarily well written entries and they were only exclusive to the U.K. But anyways 1 of the main reasons IDW haulted their production on the prequal comics was because of the Transformers director Michael Bay himself. Supposedly around the time Dark of the Moon was set to release theaters, the comics that were released in conjunction with it ended up spoiling the a good chunk of the movie. Now I have to admit that that is a bomber considering that the comics do the movies so much justice. Because they essentially provided us with an idea of how things were on Cybertron before the main storyline became more earth based and revolved around humans. But I guess I can't really be too upset with Michael Bay's decision to end it because he knows that the movies are at the forefront of this franchise. And there's a ton of stuff that I haven't even covered on this channel regarding some of the Autobots and Decepticons. Now I'm guessing that since Bay isn't tied to the current film Hasbro has given IDW the ho-ahead to continue this tradition. Like I know that the original idea was to come up with a fresh new canon that steps over the established boundaries that were previously setup. Because it's obvious that this story is gonna contradict a lot of story elements that were set in the previous run. Like I don't think the writers room took into consideration that the IDW prequel comics has already shed light of what Bumblebee was up to before the events of the movies. I'm talking every tiny detail from him getting his voice processor destroyed to how he met up with Sam Witwicky. So of coarse this new entry is bound to rewrite some of the story elements we've come to accept. But anyways I think we have a lot to look forward to because the comic will be made by the same team who worked on the Robots in Disguise comics.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dl1XcMolvNk/sddefault.jpg,0.014992032677244875,0.0006620732993693471,22.644067796610173,-2.2443162690486344e-06,0.015654105976614225,0.015651861660345174,2018-06-06,17:37:50,Wednesday,2,12,47,10,22,76,452,6,58,0,0,8,0,0,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.697453581581845,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

We don’t often think about audio when we watch sports on TV, but it’s a huge part of the experience. We spoke with several A1 audio engineers who mix the sounds of sports to learn more about what it takes to capture the crack of the bat and the swish of the net.

From the cadence of the quarterback to the sounds of skates on ice, audio mixers are tasked with getting microphones close enough to the action to gather the sounds but still out of the way of the players and the fans.

Once the microphones are set up, they handle the stressful task of live mixing all the audio for the broadcast, so that we can hear the announcers and the sounds of the game, despite thousands of screaming fans and the PA system blaring music.

In the end, if they do the job right, you’ll forget they exist.

Lyrics:
What's the trick I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too,
All it takes is that one look you do
and I run right back to you
u crossed the line
& it's time to say f-u!

What’s the point in saying that
when u know how I’ll react
U think u can just take it back
but shit just don’t work like that
you’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I’m stuck
with you
and that’s that

Cus when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don’t work out for the better
If we just ain’t right and it’s time to say goodbye
when it all falls down,
when it all falls down
I’ll be fine
I’ll be fine
I’ll be fine

You’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I’ll be fine

Why we fight, I don’t know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
staying cold,
But you take it personal,
All this firing shots,
and making grounder
It’s way too hard to cope
But I still
Can’t let
You go

All Falls Down,
All Falls Down,
All Falls Down,
All Falls Down.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dmc3sQPWl-M/sddefault.jpg,0.028540191144815895,0.000533780214778683,53.46805736636246,0.0017252166263837748,0.029073971359594573,0.030799187985978364,2017-12-01,15:16:26,Friday,4,9,45,9,45,47,363,3,92,0,3,8,31,2,3,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.3219986448200975,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Thanks to our friend Devin Supertramp for helping film some of the slo motion shots with his Red Camera. He is super talented! Look for a Behind the scenes video on his channel in the next month or two here: https://www.youtube.com/user/devinsupertramp

Also, we hope you enjoyed your April 1st April Fools joke:) Watch last years joke here: https://youtu.be/yMRVCZhKlGE

Yes this was a real atm machine that we owned and we are the ones that put the money in it. We would never steal an ATM or encourage that behavior, we just thought that little twist would be fun for you on April Fools. As we always say and as is officially trademarked in the US, ""We cut things open so you don't have to"". Don't do what we do. These videos are for entertainment and education purposes only.

Bring the action and fun into the real world as you face off in wild-west duels, cow-milking competitions, a copycat dance-off, and more. Each game takes advantage of the Joy-Con controllers and features of the Nintendo Switch system in different ways. While the action unfolds off-screen, the audience watches the players themselves instead of the screen. That makes it as hilarious to watch as it is to play – an instant party amplifier!

LINKS & THINGS MENTIONED

Checklist for suit shopping / tailoring:

Jacket:
- The shoulder seam sits on the shoulder.
- The waist fits but remains comfortable.
- Under the armpits, the jacket is adjusted (extra fabric here means that the jacket doesn't fit your body type. Taking in the waist won't solve the issue of the sleeve fit).
- Cross your arms: the back isn't building horizontal folds and you can still breathe and move normally.
- The inner lining gives you extra fabric, so you can move in the jacket without feeling tightened up.

Pants:
- The waistband isn't tight and it sits naturally above the hips.
- The front rise is at the level where your belly isn't compressed.
- The back rise is high enough to still cover your behind when you sit down. 
- In the front: no horizontal lines (folds) at the hip level - or else go 1 size up.
- The pockets are flat against your hips, not pulling and not opening. 
- Pants length: according to your taste. The classical way is slightly shorter than your legs, so that it won't touch the floor if you aren't wearing shoes. 

Happy shopping!

Must be nice having Kylie Jenner, 20, and Travis Scott, 25, as parents! After all, their newborn daughter, whose name has yet to be released, is already completely spoiled and she was only born on Feb. 1! After months of secrecy, Kylie finally revealed on Feb. 4 that yes she was pregnant, and that she already gave birth to a “healthy” and “beautiful” baby girl. In addition to sharing the exciting news with her fans via Instagram, the makeup mogul also uploaded a lengthy YouTube video that documented her past 9 months.

It's finally open! We were able to get a table and take a look at the menu, which is pretty big! Then we have some appetizers (candied bacon, calamari and fried peppers) and some mains (The Edison burger and the meatloaf) and then dessert (chocolate cake and apple cobbler), and we gave our food reviews and gave a closer look at each food item. We then walk over to Maria & Enzos which is also open now (we'll give a review soon!) and it looks nice and I really liked the look of the place a lot! We head back to The Edison and check out the live band, they were really fun! We hope you enjoyed this look at The Edison and some of the food and drink menu items.

I went to Asia with one of my best friends in the end of summer. With less than a week before school started, I put these files on the back burner as I made my way back to school to prepare for the new term. However, I still wanted to put them together so I could look back at it, like a travel diary!

I had tons of fun with Claire, and Taiwan was absolutely amazing! It was certainly hot in mid August, so that's why you will see us looking very sweaty most of the vlog. Also-- I packed very light, so I wear that same blouse many a times...

The vlogs aren't the best, now that I'm looking back at the footage while editing- it doesn't completely capture the essence of the trip and how much fun it was! But then again, it was because most times, I was so infatuated by the moment, that I was enjoying it first hand. I think it's great to capture beautiful moments on vacations, but it's crucial to not always be trapped behind the lens and to take it all in :-)
also- in your opinion, should I release the rest of the asia vlogs consecutively, or should I balance them throughout with the current vlogs? I just don't want the timeline to get confusing. Let me know pls

Thank you again, for being here- and for reading this. I'm very lucky I have you to share my stories with, and this amazing, loving community here that we can connect over. I wish you love and happiness, and until next time-

Best,
Annabelle

About 5 million years ago, a new predator made its way from the south and onto the coastal plains of North America. It was a giant, flightless, carnivorous bird and came to be known by one of the coolest and most richly earned nicknames in all of paleontology: the terror bird.

Correction! Thanks to Ben Creisler for pointing out that at 4:10, we mixed up the Paleogene Period with the Neogene Period. We regret the error and hope you still find these birds as terrifying as we do.

Thanks to Julio Lacerda and Studio 252mya for the Titanis illustration. You can find more of Julio's work here: https://252mya.com/gallery/julio-lacerda

LYRICS
Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware
Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen
Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken
How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant
All good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just

Come over, pull me in just...

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Next Mother’s Day, Gabrielle Union stars as a woman who will stop at nothing to rescue her two children being held hostage in a house designed with impenetrable security.  No trap, no trick and especially no man inside can match a mother with a mission when she is determined on Breaking In.
 
Producers Will Packer (No Good Deed, Obsessed) and Union (Almost Christmas, Being Mary Jane) reunite for this original thriller directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Sense8).  Written by Ryan Engle (Non-Stop), Breaking In co-stars Billy Burke (Twilight series), Richard Cabral (End of Watch), Seth Carr (Black Panther) and Ajiona Alexus (Empire).
 
Joining Union and Packer as fellow producers are Will Packer Productions’ James Lopez (Girls Trip, Think Like a Man), and Practical Pictures’ Craig Perry and Sheila Taylor (American Pie and Final Destination series).  Jaime Primak Sullivan, whose story the screenplay is based upon, serves as an executive producer alongside Valerie Bleth Sharp and Jeff Morrone.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DsDVOt3M7OM/sddefault.jpg,0.002907595503743685,0.00020123801965555275,14.448539638386647,0.00023678353912183256,0.0031088335233992377,0.0033456170625210703,2018-01-11,19:00:19,Thursday,3,6,68,6,41,35,515,3,82,1,0,4,9,1,9,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.754541612482535,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

I can’t believe we’re at the end of “Going Home”! You’ve seen so much of my life before YouTube, but I saved a very special moment for the end. This channel began in a small dorm room during my first year of college at Michigan State University. I had so many amazing memories there, so it was an honor when they asked me to be their Homecoming Grand Marshall. It all came full circle, as I go back to the room where it happened and celebrate a truly special homecoming. Like + Comment Below your favorite video from “Going Home!

('구독'과 '좋아요' 감사합니다 ☺)
영상에서 쓰는 도구가 궁금하다면? = https://youtu.be/o43DZn4ZrvI

안녕하세요 오늘은 SNS에서 인기가 많은 통 딸기 마카롱을 준비했어요
요즘 통딸기를 넣은 마카롱이 자주 인기가 많더라구요 
딸기 가격도 많이 내려서 만들어 보시면 좋을 것 같아요 (맛도 좋구요)

저는 지난번 민트 마카롱에 쓴 버터크림 레시피를 사용했어요 
간단하고 맛도 좋아요! 딸기+초코는 대박입니다
이렇게 먹으니 케이크 먹는거 같고 정말 맛있어요 (먹기 조금  불편한 것 만 빼면요)

저는 딸기 마카롱 4개만 만들고 나머지는 그냥 크림만 샌드했어요
아무래도 생 딸기라서 하루정도 둘 수 있거든요 
맛있는 딸기 초코 마카롱 만들어보세요 :-)

▶재료 (15개 분량)
▷ 마카롱 쉘
슈가파우더 84g, 아몬드가루 92g, 흰자 70g, 설탕 70g, 식용색소 (갈색, 빨강색)

▷ 초콜릿 버터크림
버터 200g, 코코아가루 30g, 녹인 초콜릿 70g, 슈가파우더 120g

▷ 기타
딸기

1) 아몬드가루와 슈가파우더를 체쳐 섞어둡니다
2) 흰자를 휘핑하며 설탕을 3번 나눠 넣어줍니다
3) 영상과 같이 윤기나고 단단한 머랭이 완성되면 체쳐둔 가루를 넣고 섞어줍니다
4) 날가루가 보이지 않으면 반으로 나눠 각각 준비한 색소를 넣고 섞어줍니다
5) 떨어뜨렸을 때 영상과 같은 농도가 되면 짤 주머니에 담아줍니다
6) 팬 위에 반죽을 동그랗게 짜주고 건조 될 때 까지 그대로 둡니다
7) 손으로 만졌을 때 손에 반죽이 묻어나지 않으면 오븐을 150~160도로 예열합니다
8) 예열한 오븐에 13~15분 간 구워줍니다 (구운 마카롱 식히는 동안 크림 만들기)
9) 실온에 두어 말랑해진 버터를 풀어줍니다
10) 코코아가루, 녹인 초콜릿, 슈가파우더를 순서대로  넣어가며 휘핑합니다
11) 믹서기로 빠르게 휘핑해 밝은 갈색이 되도록 해줍니다 
12) 완성한 버터크림은 짤 주머니에 담아줍니다
13) 식은 마카롱 꼬끄 위아랫면 다 크림을 짜줍니다 
14) 가운에 준비한 생 딸기를 넣고 샌드합니다
(딸기를 넣은 마카롱은 하루 이내로 다 드시고 
크림만 샌드한 마카롱은 냉장실에서 2일, 일주일 정도 보관 하시려면 냉동실에 넣어둡니다)

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다
시청해주셔서 감사합니다

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DzNivtmv7xs/sddefault.jpg,0.019432556357409488,0.0002160532638812112,89.943359375,0.0003789371698541556,0.0196486096212907,0.020027546791144855,2018-05-18,05:19:08,Friday,4,17,37,17,32,92,327,6,76,0,1,10,16,5,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1971061639408775,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

How To Get In Our Intro:

If you want to be featured in the beginning of one of our videos send us a video via email saying, ""Hey FAMILY, my name is (your name) and I'm from (where you're from). Let's keep growing together!"" to KaelinAndKyrah@gmail.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About Us:
A young Christian family of three enjoying life together. We document the everyday balance of a teen marriage and teen pregnancy. Our goal through our vlogs is to motivate, encourage, and inspire other young people to thrive in life despite their circumstances. On this channel we believe we aren't meant to do life alone. So, join the family by subscribing. Let's grow together.

A brief history:

Kyrah and I met and dated at age 13 in the 7th grade (2009). Kyrah broke up with me after a long three month relationship, but we soon rekindled in high school. We went to every prom and formal together. She was a cheerleader, and I was the tracklete. We were high school sweethearts. 

We got married in early 2017 at the young age of 19. Months later, just before her 20th birthday, we found out Kyrah was pregnant with our first child. Since high school we have been documenting our college struggles, traveling, and everywhere else life has taken us. We pray you join us!

Eine Geschichte voller Missverständnisse

Anhand von Anekdoten aus 20 Jahren Softwareentwicklung versucht der Vortrag herauszuarbeiten, was in der Praxis zu scheiternden Projekten führt.


Es geht nicht um Programmierfehler sondern um Fehler in der Herangehensweise, den Prozessen, falsche Anreize, etc.

Bei den Antipatterns geht es um Dinge, die aus den falschen Gründen gemacht werden -- etwa einen Monolithen in eine Microservice-Architektur überführen, aber dann bei einem verteilen Monolithen rauskommen. Ein gemeinsames Muster ist, dass man mit chirurgischer Präzision die Vorteile eines Ansatzes gezielt umgeht, aber großzügig jeden einzelnen Nachteil mitnimmt.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Val Fiott - I love your shows!‎ Quick question: why would Luke leave a map for Leia to find him if he clearly did not want to be found?

Edgar Tejeda - HI, john. What you think of the possibility of Lucas films of taking a break from the saga films after episode 9 (2-4 Years)and do the Rian Johnson trilogy, the Benioff & Weiss series and the anthology films like the Kenobi film if is green lit, then do a time jump in the saga story and revisit the characters a few years later.

Steve F - Just saw Rebels Episode 10, and god damnit I love being wrong! Rebels is for kids? No sir, not any longer! The return hit on all cylinders for me, I loved the tension between Krennic's plan for Stardust and Thrawn's TIE Defender program. John, after seeing this I think and stand by the idea that Filoni DESERVES directorship of his own trilogy.

To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4k2xVCYoy4/hqdefault.jpg,0.03938193343898574,0.001584786053882726,24.85,0.0030110935023771788,0.04096671949286846,0.04397781299524564,2017-12-20,20:41:40,Wednesday,2,6,19,6,19,37,150,1,34,0,0,6,11,2,2,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4898797128324555,3,"['scared', 'scared', 'neutral']",0,0,2,0,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

Yeah, it's not the best thing that can happen to you, I hope you never have to live something like this. However, if during a trip something happens to the aircraft, the pilot has to make an effort and demonstrate his abilities to balance the plane and land the aircraft without killing people.

Disney, Universal, Busch Gardens, Sea World, and Legoland. The only rules we gave ourselves were that we had to go into the park and ride at least one ride. We start out very early in the morning at Busch Gardens Tampa where we rode Cheetah Hunt. After that we left and headed to Legoland Florida where we ran into a huge issue! Legoland was closed for the day! We decided that at the end of the day we would make up for missing out on Legoland by going to Fun Spot to ride Mine Blower. Once we collected ourselves from the disappointment of Legoland we headed over to Sea World Orlando to ride Mako. Mako brought our spirits right back up! It was time to head to Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure where we rode E.T. and took the Hogwarts express to Islands of Adventure to ride Spider-Man. We were on a roll at this point! We made our Fast Passes and headed to Animal Kingdom to ride Expedition Everest. While in line we made Fast Passes for our next stop at Disney's Hollywood Studios where we rode Star Tours. After being a little shaken up by that ride we headed to Magic Kingdom for Pirates of the Caribbean which we almost missed our Fast Pass time for! Finally it was time for our last Disney park of the day with a trip to Epcot to ride Space Ship Earth! Just our luck the ride stopped as soon as we sat down! The cast members found out what the issue was and we were on our way before we knew it! We had done it! All nine parks in one day! But we weren't happy with the fact that we didn't ride anything at Legoland so we headed off to Fun Spot to achieve our final ride of the day on Mine Blower, the parks wooden roller coaster! It was an epic day to say the least. Join us tomorrow for another new video!

VERSE 1:
I shall hold
To the cross
I shall hold
To God alone
For His love
Has salvaged me
For His love
Has set me free

CHORUS:
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Whosoever believes
Will not perish
They shall have eternal life

VERSE 2:
I shall wait
Upon the Lord
I shall wait
Upon His Word
By His grace
I am released
By His grace
I am redeemed

BRIDGE:
By His precious blood
I have been set free
For the glory of Jesus' Name
I surrender all 
Now to Christ alone
In Jesus I am saved

palindrome
by Anna Akana
(after Lisel Mueller) 

Her last breath slowly fills up her 
lungs. Feet float to the top of the 
toy chest. Red scarf unwinds
itself from her neck. The Korean pop song unplays 
on a loop. Tears crawl back up their paths into 
her eyes. Sadness unfolds itself to blinding anger. 
The paper’s blotchy letters come into focus. 
The idea leaves her head. 
Doors unslam. Words claw back into her mouth, 
settling in the fire of her gut. She’s having her last 
fight with me, but I don’t know that yet. I hate you, 
slams back into my mouth. The pink homemade Valentine’s 
card she knocked over leaps from the floor and into
place on my desk. She paces backwards, swallowing
the vomit of 
no one understands no one knows no one listens
no one cares no one loves me I’m alone 
She unopens
my door. 
I have a sister still.

Hollywood blockbusters have become increasingly reliant on visual effects over the past few decades, and recent advances in technology have made it so feats in VFX work that were considered impossible just a few years ago are now well within reach. More and more studios are using CGI in films, mostly because it's often cheaper than the alternative. In fact, many modern blockbusters are covered in so many digital layers that the original footage looks unrecognizable—and more often than not, completely ridiculous. Here's what these movies really looked like before special effects were added...

Check out the V10 on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2q8ZQK9
Read our detailed V10 written review here: https://vacuum-cleaner-advisor.com/Dyson-Vacuums/dyson-v10-review.html

We highlight that the battery cannot be swapped out, that the trigger must continually be depressed to get power, that you only get 60 minutes of run time in certain configurations of power and cleaner head, that the dustbin can be tricky to empty, that it is heavier than its v6, v7 and v8 predecessors, that the handheld component is a bit bulky, that on Max mode the battery life is rather short, that on low power mode you only get 15.8 air watts of suction, that it isn't easy to determine whether it cleans better than the V8, and that it is a rather expensive cordless stick vacuum.

I would also like to point out that I make every effort to be unbiased in my videos.  If there is something about a product I do not like - I will let you know!

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Bryan K - Hi John. What do you this is the movie deal of the decade. Disney buys Lucas Film or Fox? Or is there a big deal gone down I have forgotten or coming up?

PATREON Supporter Ali Hussein - Hi John love your show. My question is: are Disney going to continue shows like legion and the gifted both are base on  X-Men universe. Love do hear your thoughts.

Anat Segal - Last week Peter Jackson announced the trailer for the new movie he produced ""The mortal engines"" will debut with the ""The Last Jedi"", however i haven't seen anyone talk about it or seen it online.

Nate P - Films are subjective and people are allowed to dislike a film. I find it pathetic however people maybe going to such lengths to artificially sabotage audience score on rottentomatoes. I'll elaborate citing a facebook user group who claimed responsibility for influencing the low audience score via use of bot accounts. The user group claims to be pro, the old star wars EU and DCEU, it is considering targeting Avengers: Infinity War as well. Your thoughts?

From Academy Award® -winning filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet from Stardom), Won’t You Be My Neighbor? takes an intimate look at America’s favorite neighbor: Mister Fred Rogers. A portrait of a man whom we all think we know, this emotional and moving film takes us beyond the zip-up cardigans and the land of make-believe, and into the heart of a creative genius who inspired generations of children with compassion and limitless imagination.

Due to escalating violence in his home country, Zain was granted asylum in the United States and has settled in New York City with his family. Eager to adjust to life in America, the 13-year-old and his siblings are attending a “refugee summer camp” that will help them improve their English language skills.

For thousands of years, humans have drawn lines on the earth, dividing the planet into nations. But there are some parts of the world that no empire, nation or state has been able to tame.

In this episode of Borders, Johnny heads deep into the Himalaya mountains to learn about how people have lived away from the concept of borders. China and Nepal are acting fast to develop this remote region and it's having major effects on the local population.

Directed by Nash Edgerton.

An exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth — or two steps ahead?

#GringoMovie

About Gringo:
Mild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.

Targeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.

Pursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.
Directed by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.

OnePlus is looking to join the large screen to body ratio market with their new OnePlus 5T. OnePlus decided to shake things up a little and changed their cameras to a 16 MP main camera and a 20 MP secondary for enhanced low-light photography. Unlocking your phone will be super fast with their fingerprint sensor and face unlock. The OnePlus 5T is one of the best phones for it’s price range competing against the S8, LG V30, Essential PH-1, Pixel 2 XL and the iPhone X.

It's ZOMS Vs POMS!

Welcome to Seabrook, just your normal, picture-perfect town… if that town had a mysterious green gas leak causing a zombie apocalypse! 😱

Fast forward 50 years and the Zombies, thanks to the Z-band, now pose no threat to the humans and the two live harmoniously in the town (kinda). The Zombies have been banished to the isolated outskirts of Seabrook and must live in the run down 'Zombietown' 🏚, interacting as little as possible with the 'Normals' (humans). BUT THEN, life as they know it is officially changed forever when the Zoms find out they can FINALLY enrol in Seabrook High School 🏫. How will the 'normals' take it… you'll have to watch to find out!

ZOMS
All they want is to be treated like anyone else, go to normal school, hang out with the human kids and NOT be treated like freaks. But some humans (and by that we mean most) still think that they will be a zombie's main course if they are anywhere near them. SO, for now, zombies at Seabrook High must come in a different entrance and have all their classes in the basement. Oh, and the school has a built in Zombie panic room, in case they try to, you know… eat anyone. 🆘

POMS
Omg! 😆 Being a cheerleader at Seabrook High is the ultimate indicator of social status, and everybody who's anybody knows it. Their main job alongside maintaining school pep, is to cheer on the Seabrook High football team A.K.A the Mighty Shrimp… GOoooooo Shrimps! 🏈

As if this film isn't already jam packed full of pom-poms, spirit, pep, cheer and best of all zombies, it also has some awesome tunes like 'Bamm', 'Fired up', 'Someday' and 'My Year' that will make any Zombie you feel alive!

Who's who?

Zed (Milo Manheim) is team Zombie. Zed and his friends Eliza & Bonzo are among the first few zombies that have actually been allowed to enrol in Seabrook High School. He believes if he joins the Mighty Shrimp that one day humans and zombies will live happily in Seabrook and everyone will be treated the same. Dream on Zed, dream on. 👫💭

Addison (Meg Donnelly) is team Pom. Addison has always wanted to follow in her cousin Bucky's footsteps and become a Seabrook cheerleader 📣, so when she is picked to join the squad as a freshman it's a dream come true! But she is hiding a secret, and although she might look the part on team Pom, she knows what it is like to be different.

Bucky (Trevor Tordjman) is the leader of team Pom 🤸. As head cheerleader, he is responsible for hiring and more often firing the members of the squad. Due to this power, he pretty much controls the entire school and his dislike for the zombies soon becomes everyone's view.

Eliza (Kylee Russell) is team Zom. She is not only Zed's bestie but a complete computer whiz that could hack in her sleep 💻! She unlike Zed, is more suspicious of the humans especially Bucky and his posse of pom-poms. She doesn't believe that humans and zombies will ever get along but that doesn't mean she won't help Zed out with his plans.

Zoey (Kingston Foster) is team Zom. Zoey is Zed's little sis and although she might be a zombie she is SUPER CUTE! It is her dream to one day become a Seabrook cheerleader, but zombies aren't allowed to try out. Let's hope her big bro comes through and mends this divided town! 💚

Bonzo (James Godfrey) is definitely team Zom! He the third member in the little trio and the peacemaker of the group - even if he can only speak in zombie!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EDlsBlLlqzM/sddefault.jpg,0.0035723075003515218,0.0002600439344451035,13.737322918045807,5.439817508582862e-06,0.0038323514347966257,0.0038377912523052094,2018-05-30,16:30:00,Wednesday,2,11,69,10,60,69,605,10,149,3,0,6,9,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.7131254771931586,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

VERSE 1:
I take the bread of life
Broken for all my sin
Your body crucified
To make me whole again

VERSE 2:
I will recall the cup
Poured out in sacrifice
To trade this sinners' end
For Your new covenant 

CHORUS:
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance 
Hallelujah Your promise I won't forget

VERSE 3:
I'll walk salvation's road
With fear and trembling
Your way borne as my own
As Christ is formed in me

CHORUS:
Hallelujah 
I'll live my life in remembrance 
Hallelujah 
Your promise I won't forget

POST CHORUS 1:
If ever I should lose my way
If ever I deny Your grace
Remind me of the price You paid
Hallelujah 
I'll live in remembrance 

BRIDGE (repeated):
You've been so so good to me
You've been so so good to me
Oh to think where I would be
If not for You
If not for You

POST CHORUS 2:
As far as heights reach from the depths
As far as east is from the west
So far Your grace has carried me

POST CHORUS 3:
Until I see You face to face
Until at last I've won my race
Remind me Youʼre not finished yet

TAG:
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance

Hudson denies having any relationship with the producer, but Otunga believes Hudson and Mali Music were having a secret affair for months before the confrontation.
We're told Jennifer and Mali Music met a few years ago, when she hired him to perform at a party. They became friends and we're told they have been in the studio together a number of times. She told Charlamagne Tha God back in 2014, ""My favorite artist is Mali Music. See, y'all don't even know who he is. Y'all gotta look up Mali Music, trust me.""

Mali Music was deep into gospel but crossed over into secular music.

Movie Summary: “After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.”

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

The rope can be used to make bags, floor mats and other craft items. Yet because processing sisal is difficult and time consuming, there is more demand for rope than farmers can currently fill. Enter Alex Odundo. He collected scrap metal from bicycle sprockets, motorcycle chains and other sources to build machines that could efficiently process the plant into fiber and then rope. It took him nine prototypes, but Odundo’s machines—the Sisal Dicorticator and the Sisal Twinner— have proven a godsend for his community. With around 100 models sold, these machines are helping farmers support themselves amid the uncertainty of climate change.

Today I wanted to give you guys a real treat! I broke down Lonzo Ball's shooting form. I believe by implementing some of these tips Lonzo could easily go from being a sub par shooter as he has been early in his rookie season, to a lights out shooter with a few minor tweaks. Make sure to listen to these tips and implement them into your own game as well!

🎙️🎹Lyrics

why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

i find it so strange
after all these years
i’m still more or less the same

wherever i go
whatever i do
 whatever i know
it just comes and goes so soon

whatever life brings
whatever song it seems
i’m still whistling the same old tune

why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

i find it so strange
after all these years
i’m still more or less the same

whoever i’m with
whatever i take
whatever i give
i’m still running in the same old race

whatever choice i make
whatever road i take
i still wind up in the same old place

so why
why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

oh i
i find it so strange
after all these years
i’m still more or less the same

i’m more or less the same
i’m more or less the same

Lyrics:
Don't talk about your love
Just make me taste it

Don't blow away the smoke
Let me inhale it

Be daring or be gentle,
Simple or colorful,
Go 60 or down zero

Just make me feel like..

Here and now
Is endless
When you're around
I need no one else
Touching my body
I'm melting like gold
Be greedy
When you feel me
Here and now
Endless

You're closing in
I'm closing out the others

So don't waste your love
Cause all I need is a lover

Be daring or be gentle,
Simple or colorful,
Go 60 or down zero

Just make me feel like..",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EIGmzytviNw/sddefault.jpg,0.02602157567832625,0.0002942137953579601,88.44444444444444,0.0005067015364498202,0.02631578947368421,0.026822491010134036,2018-02-16,08:00:01,Friday,4,6,8,6,8,29,58,2,15,1,2,3,6,0,0,4.0,6.0,"['a ee', '', 'vevo']","['a', 'ee', 'vevo']",True,"['a', 'ee', 'vevo']",3,3,7,0,0,0,1,5.325167885059145,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

A second vlog in a row, to wrap up my winter session term at school, and kicking off the one week break (before spring term begins). As mentioned above, I will definitely explain processes such as my final project and also my hair dyeing in a separate video.

I hope your week has been going well! It is halfway until the weekend... I usually spend my days looking forward to days of break over and over on repeat, and then suddenly look back to realize how quickly time has gone by. I think it is important for me to cherish everyday, including those of hardship and dread, for our responsibilities and tragedies. I am grateful, at the end of each one to be able to rest knowing that tomorrow brings new chances, and the sun will rise and cover me, little me, who is one small creature on this vast world, surrounded by those we can love and cherish. 

I am endlessly grateful for you being a part of this community, thank you so much for all of it. Although I don't reply to every single message and comment, I do my best to read each one. The time spend to do that, or to watch the memories I share with you means so much.

EKTP4k-X_Oc,XPrHD-7jjUs,2 Million Snakes Have Taken Over The Island Of Guam (HBO),VICE News,25.0,2018-02-01 20:30:00+00:00,"['brown tree snakes', '2 Million Snakes Have Taken Over The Island Of Guam', 'snakes guam infestation', 'vice snakes guam', 'brown tree snake video', 'guam', 'snake invasion', 'vice', 'vice news', 'vice news tonight', 'HBO', 'snakes', 'ecosystem', 'Department of Defense', 'invasion', 'happening now', 'forest', 'environment', 'problem', 'investation', 'science', 'territory', 'law enforcement', 'danger', 'snake island', 'python hunters', 'vice python', 'vice news HBO', 'snake florida', 'python florida', 'patrick barnhart', 'us geological survey']",1116279.0,6663.0,467.0,1626.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EKTP4k-X_Oc/default.jpg,"Brown tree snakes are taking over Guam — in fact, they outnumber humans on the island 10 to 1, and they've taken a major toll on its ecosystem. The problem now has the U.S. government on the offensive, enlisting multiple government agencies, including the Department of Defense, to eradicate the invasive reptiles.

Since brown tree snakes are nocturnal, hunting them takes place at night. Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey deploy groups of researchers to monitor traps and catch the snakes by hand. Catching them is a tedious process, but it's crucial that the snakes be studied, and tracked, in order to develop effective control methods.

Brown tree snakes have been a problem for the U.S. territory of Guam since the 1950s, when they were introduced there, most likely from a military vessel coming back to port from a neighboring island. But it's gotten to the level of forcing government action — to kill them, or at least keep them from getting off the island and causing the same problem somewhere else.

This was a really fun project. We really wanted build something that showcased the idea that a project could be geared toward beginners with minimal workshop tools who need a practical thing, or it could be aimed at fanboys (or girls) with robot tools that want outrageous things. Regardless of your skill set, workshop size, or tool inventory, you have the ability to turn an idea into a reality...even if you don't possess the Reality Stone.

You can find the original cast album of “21 Chump Street: The Musical” on, iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify.

Nearly 50 actors, singers, dancers, musicians, and comedians joined Ira Glass onstage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House on June 7, 2014, to try some things they'd never tried before. The result? Journalism turned into opera, into plays, into a Broadway musical (by Lin-Manuel Miranda, starring Lindsay Mendez and Anthony Ramos). Comedy from Mike Birbiglia and Saturday Night Live’s Sasheer Zamata. Songs from Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields. Dance from Monica Bill Barnes & Company. Video directed by Seth Lind and produced by Ben Cohen and Ben Katz.

You can download the full live show for $5: http://live.thisamericanlife.org",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ELBGa6-uOhc/sddefault.jpg,0.03020931256180189,0.00017069819218421749,176.975,0.0034389589361113245,0.030380010753986112,0.033818969690097435,2018-01-10,00:44:34,Wednesday,2,14,1,13,1,72,2,3,2,1,0,8,0,3,0,4.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.053851000271023,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'chair': 2, 'person': 5}",7

Lyrics:
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

I will have to keep riding this thing to see if it can stand the test of time! Check out the meepo here - https://meepoboard.com/products/meepo-board?variant=4538537345051

*** Update***
The board is actually advertised as NOT WATERPROOF. It's obviously not a good idea to skate on wet surfaces anyway so use caution with puddles. Also it may not be as smooth as the original test. Acceleration seems to cut from time to time making it a bit touchy... the testing will continue.

4/22/18
The board has been experiencing some lag with the controller. A combination of the short throw of the accelerator and the delay from when you let it off makes the board a bit jerky when moving the throttle at higher speeds. Nothing that you can't get used to however I much prefer other controllers available on the market. (See Yeeplay video for more info)

With more than 2 billion users, it’s true that the platform does connect people. But one thing that Mark Zuckerberg’s two days of congressional testimony highlighted is that simply connecting people is not how Facebook reached a market cap of nearly $500 billion. 

At its core, Facebook is an advertising company. In 2017, 98 percent of its $40 billion in revenue came from advertising. It’s not your data that Facebook is selling, it’s your attention. 

Facebook’s ad platform translates your clicks and posts into “user attributes,” and places  you in certain categories for advertisers. For example, your activity could suggest an that you recently had a child, that you’re a Bernie Sanders fan, or that you have an “affinity” for certain racial groups.

One of the most powerful features is called “Custom Audiences,” which allows an advertiser to target individuals based on offline information such as email address or phone numbers. An advertiser can upload that data to Facebook, which will match them with its user base to find who they belong to. Then there are so-called “dark posts,” a feature Facebook is in the process of changing, which only show up in the news feeds of specific audiences and are completely hidden to everyone else.

These tools can be used by anyone who wants to advertise on Facebook, and critics say that’s an open invitation for malicious actors. Watch this video to learn more about how Facebook’s ad targeting works, and why it’s so effective.

Well, the inevitable has finally happened -- Walmart Yodel Boy was on Ellen.

This episode is brought to you by NHTSA reminding us that if you’re texting you’re not driving.

They say the only certainties in life are death and taxes, but I think we can add cute kids who go viral meeting Ellen to that list.

After straight up DEMOLISHING the Internet over the last week thanks to his rendition of Hank Williams Sr.’s “Lovesick Blues” getting memed left and right, Walmart Yodel Boy sat down with Ellen to talk about his country-singing dreams and more.

11-year-old Mason Ramsey also talked about his humbling beginnings -- ya know, like two weeks ago -- and how he performed at Walmart quote “50,000” times because that’s the only store they’ve got in his hometown of Harrisburg, Illinois.

Mason also revealed that his trip to LA to be on Ellen’s talk show was his first time on an airplane! Talk about going places.

And OF COURSE he couldn’t stop by Ellen without putting those pipes to work.

But that’s not even the best part! You know Ellen always has some kind of trick up her sleeve, so she surprised Mason by telling him that he’d be performing at the famed Grand Ole Opry in Nashville this weekend. Which OBVIOUSLY is a dream come true for him. And me too, to be honest.

On top of that, Walmart has also given Mason a $15,000 scholarship. Man, talk about a whirlwind couple weeks for Mason!

What do YOU think of Mason’s newfound fame? Think he’s country’s next big superstar? Hit the comments to get talking, and make sure you subscribe to Clevver while you’re at it. As always thank you for watching, I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr., we’ll see you next time!

Bitter sweet kid I’m not listening
can we work this out in the morning
when you’re like this I can’t stomach it
can you put down what you’re holding

Do I need to spell it out spell it out
I can’t form words with my mouth
Do I need to spell it out spell it out
You’ve got me alone now

Don’t get too close to me
You’ll be loving me
loving me forever better
not choke on cellophane
inhaling all the things that make you better
better

My insides like a sink
I’ll clean them out in the morning
When you’re like this we don’t speak
bleach these please

Do I need to spell it out spell it out
I can’t form words with my mouth

Don’t get too close to me
You’ll be loving me
loving me forever better
not choke on cellophane
inhaling all the things that make you better
better

I was inspired by Drake and his God's Plan music video to do something for a community I know, which is video games. Growing up, having a game console was life changing for me. I wanted to give that to kids who couldn't have that. All of the money spent here came out of my pocket. I'm not a rich kid, it's not my parents money. I worked for it, and I wanted to give back. Thank you for all of the support! Be sure to subscribe for more of the best Fortnite Parody songs!

What did you think of this Drake - Gods Plan Parody? Should I do more Fortnite Parody songs? Fortnite Rap songs? Was Gods Plan Fortnite a hit? Let me know!

FILM DESCRIPTION:
John Form (Ward Horton) thinks he's found the perfect gift for his expectant wife, Mia (Annabelle Wallis) : a vintage doll in a beautiful white dress. However, the couple's delight doesn't last long: One terrible night, devil worshippers invade their home and launch a violent attack against the couple. When the cultists try to summon a demon, they smear a bloody rune on the nursery wall and drip blood on Mia's doll, thereby turning the former object of beauty into a conduit for ultimate evil.

During World War Two, the Canadian government set up a loan program to help Chinese companies provide all manner of material aid to Canada’s allies. Among many others, one recipient of this aid was the Nationalist Chinese government under Chiang Kai Shek. Chinese representatives asked the John Inglis company to manufacture no less than 180,000 Browning High Power pistols, and the company agreed.
 
After some wrangling, Inglis acquired a license from FH representatives to make the guns, got a complete technical package through the British government and FN’s representatives in exile, and the direct personal aid of Laloux and Saive from FN. Delivery proved difficult, though, with only about 4000 guns being shipped to Karachi and then needing to be flown over The Hump in cargo planes, along with massive amounts of other aid - and a few pistols didn’t get a lot of priority there.
 
By the fall of 1944, the contract was cancelled under concerns that it was not really contributing to any progress in the war against the Japanese, along with insistence from American General Stilwell that the Chinese forces be armed with weapons that could be supplied more easily through the American logistic network. Production restarted after the defeat of Germany, with another 40,000 or so being made and delivered before it was cancelled again when the Nationalist Chinese forces were seen to be clearly losing to their Communist opponents.
 
Each of these pistols was supplied with a combination shoulder stock and holster. In the US, attaching a stock to a pistol would normally subject it to registration as a Short Barreled Rifle, but the Inglis High Powers are among the guns exempted from this requirement. They are, in fact, among the least expensive and most modern guns to be exempted in this way.

The minifigures are all exclusive as of this set's release and that may be a huge draw for some of you! Han Solo, Chewbacca, Qi’ra, Lando Calrissian, Quay Tolsite and a Kessel Operations Droid, plus a DD-BD droid are excellent choices straight out of Solo: A Star Wars Story!

REBOLAR
(Umberto Tavares/ Jefferson Junior/ Luísa Sonza)

Não sei se você se importa
Mas não me importa
O que vai pensar (não, não)

Só sei que é a minha hora
Não vai ter mais volta
E agora eu vou

Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Já foi sua vez
Agora deixa eu vacilar
Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Ninguém me segura hoje eu quero rebolar

Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Já foi sua vez agora deixa eu vacilar
Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Ninguém me segura
Eu vou rebolar

Foi sair com seus amigos, escondido
Foi pra night
Agora diz que tá arrependido, deprimido
Sai daqui, cai fora

Agora quem não quer sou eu
Agora quem não quer você sou eu
Agora quem não quer sou eu
Agora quem não quer você sou eu

Mente pra me dar perdido
Eu duvido, tá sofrendo agora
Tava achando que é bandido
Meu querido, dá licença porquê

Agora quem não quer sou eu
Agora quem não quer você sou eu
Não adianta me ligar
Porque eu já tô saindo e vou

Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Já foi sua vez agora deixa eu vacilar
Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Ninguém me segura hoje eu quero rebolar

Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Já foi sua vez agora deixa eu vacilar
Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Ninguém me segura
Eu vou rebolar

Foi sair com seus amigos, escondido
Foi pra night
Agora, diz que tá arrependido, deprimido
Sai daqui, cai fora

Agora quem não quer sou eu
Agora quem não quer você sou eu
Agora quem não quer sou eu
Agora quem não quer você sou eu

Mente pra me dar perdido
Eu duvido, tá sofrendo agora
Tava achando que é bandido
Meu querido, dá licença porquê

Agora quem não quer sou eu
Agora quem não quer você sou eu
Não adianta me ligar
Porque eu já tô saindo e vou

Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Já foi sua vez agora deixa eu vacilar
Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Ninguém me segura hoje eu quero rebolar

Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Já foi sua vez agora deixa eu vacilar
Rebolar, rebolar, rebolar, rebolar
Ninguém me segura

Ninguém me segura hoje eu quero rebolar
Ninguém me segura hoje eu quero rebolar

But somebody’s got to be there to get it on tape – and that’s a pretty tough gig.

Zach Wurtz has been working as a political “tracker” in Washington State for almost a decade. Most of his work involves driving for hours to tape local politicians giving speeches. Sometimes these are massive ballroom events with rich Republican donors, other times they’re tiny gatherings in community centers.

If his “target” shows up to give a speech in public, Zach shows up too, camera in hand – ready to capture every word and send it back to his (usually Democratic) client.

He’s a bit like a spy, except he’s so famous in Washington political circles that everybody knows who he is — and tries to kick him out of their events.

VICE News rode along with Zach to find out what life as one of the most-hated people in politics is really like.

Authorities raised the alert level after Mayon erupted twice within four hours.

""This early morning around 2:25 am there was what is called a lava foundering event where in the volcano threw out some lava fragments, but this was just short-lived about less than a minute. And then again at 12:45 pm there was what we call a phreatomagmatic eruption wherein it produced an ash column about 10 kilometers high and it also produced what we call a pyroclastic flows around the volcano,"" said Paul Alanis, a science research specialist at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

Mount Mayon in the Philippines was active again on Monday, erupting multiple times after a week of silence and leading authorities to raise the volcano's alert level from three to level four.

The level four alert suggests a ""hazardous eruption is imminent."" Therefore nearby residents were evacuated and the danger zone was further expanded.

""Now what this means is an eruption is rather imminent within the next few hours or days. And it also means the danger zone around the volcano has now been increased from six kilometres. It's now eight kilometres,"" said Alanis.

Following alert level raises earlier in the day, Mayon volcano proceeded to erupt multiple times around 4 pm and after 9 pm. The eruptions in the evening shot lava hundreds of metres into the air and produced volcanic ash that measured 1,250 metres in length.

Flights in and out of Albay Province where the volcano is located were all cancelled. Elementary schools and middle schools in the province are suspended due to the eruptions.

The volcano became active on January 13 when the alert level was raised from level one to level three.

How were the Axis powers able to instigate the most lethal conflict in human history? Find out in part one of this episode as military historian, editor of Strategika, and Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow, Victor Davis Hanson, joins Peter Robinson to discuss his latest book, The Second World Wars. 

Victor Davis Hanson explains how World War II initially began in 1939 as a multitude of isolated border blitzkriegs that Germany continued to win. In 1941, everything changed when Germany invaded their ally, the Soviet Union, and brought Japan into the war. He argues that because of the disparate nature of World War II, it’s much harder to think about as a monolithic conflict. 

World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history with approximately sixty million people killed. Victor Davis Hanson argues that World War II and the many lives lost was preventable, but due to a series of missteps by the Allied forces, Germany believed they were stronger and their enemies weaker than the reality. He argues “it took Soviet collusion, American indifference or isolation, and British or French appeasement in 30s” to convince Germany that they had the military capabilities to invade western Europe. In the aftermath of World War I, the allies believed the cost of the Great War had been too high, while Germany bragged about their defeat as no enemy soldiers had set foot on German soil.  Great Britain and France both chose appeasement over deterrence, which encouraged rather than deterred Hitler and Germany from moving forward with their plans. 

Watch the full episode to learn more about the history of World War II.

Lyrics: 
There she goes
Under the sun
Some question there

Roll her eyes
Blonde, your hair
Fake eyelashes

Sun came up
Baby went black
And she rolled over

There she goes
Around the bend
The sun is slow
Unknown friend

There she goes
The son went bad
The cycle ends

Who takes your name back
When he says he’s four streets from your bed
And I’m loving and sick

There she goes
On her bike
Earth to her side

When you’re loving most at night
And I love you back
When the sun rises, I ..
Who will call you back

It’s a whisper
It’s just a whisper
It’s just a whisper",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUWVoxcK5Q4/sddefault.jpg,0.01187480863186762,0.00017306335450031283,68.61538461538461,0.0010982866727904466,0.012047871986367932,0.01314615865915838,2018-05-11,13:43:36,Friday,4,5,11,5,11,26,94,4,23,4,0,0,1,0,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.617156463557328,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'tie': 2},2

https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-continental-divide-trail/
The CDT travels through New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Many people consider hiking the Continental Divide Trail as one of the hardest thru hikes in the world. While it is hard, there are many hard trails around the world. It took 5 months to complete the thru hike. The CDT is 3100 miles long.

This is the second video on my hiking journey to complete the hiking triple crown.
My name is Brad, on the hiking trails I'm known as Shepherd. 
Make sure you subscribe to this channel, more adventure travel videos are coming soon. I am bicycle touring around the world and thru hiking all the best hiking trails in the world.

The Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a 3-1 deficit for the first time in NBA Finals history and brought the city of Cleveland their first championship since 1964.  Let's take an in-depth look back at the classic 7 game series between the 2016 NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors.


About the NBA:
The NBA is the premier professional basketball league in the United States and Canada. The league is truly global, with games and programming in 215 countries and territories in 47 languages, as well as NBA rosters at the start of the 2015-16 season featuring  100 international players from 37 countries and territories. For the 2015-16 season, each of the league's 30 teams will play 82 regular-season games, followed by a postseason for those that qualify.

The NBA consists of the following teams: Atlanta Hawks; Boston Celtics; Brooklyn Nets; Charlotte Hornets; Chicago Bulls; Cleveland Cavaliers; Dallas Mavericks; Denver Nuggets; Detroit Pistons; Golden State Warriors; Houston Rockets; Indiana Pacers; Los Angeles Clippers; Los Angeles Lakers; Memphis Grizzlies; Miami Heat; Milwaukee Bucks; Minnesota Timberwolves; New Orleans Pelicans; New York Knicks; Oklahoma City Thunder; Orlando Magic; Philadelphia 76ers; Phoenix Suns; Portland Trail Blazers; Sacramento Kings; San Antonio Spurs; Toronto Raptors; Utah Jazz; Washington Wizards.

LeBron Raymone James (born December 30, 1984) is an American basketball player with the Cleveland Cavaliers. James first garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country. With his unique combination of size, athleticism and court vision, he became one of the premier players in the NBA. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, he returned to Cleveland and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016.

Watch other Star Wars Battle Breakdown episodes here: https://goo.gl/ks5Voi

The Battle of Jakku, (which, as much as Endor, could arguably be regarded as the end of the Galactic Civil War) has been featured heavily in Star Wars Battlefront II and I,  the Star Wars Aftermath Trilogy, and in a way Star Wars the Force Awakens. It featured the New Republic, led by Starhawk Cruisers and Admiral Ackbar, and the Galactic Empire's Ravager Super Star Destroyer.

After talking with a ride attendant we found out that the VR was going to be down for a few weeks. This seems like the Virtual Reality roller coaster will be back after the technical issues have been worked out. However, there were two trains operating the day we went; neither of those trains had the VR headsets on them. Aside from Kraken we also got to ride Mako, our favorite roller coaster in Florida, and Manta. We were able to get full ride POVs of all 3 roller coasters. Both Mako and Manta were just as smooth as they have ever been. Stay tuned for a new video tomorrow.

It comes in $100 million less than 2013’s ‘Man of Steel’ which was the first film to kick off this version of the DCEU. The film was plagued with numerous negative reports during its production which culminated with the replacement of Zack Snyder with Joss Whedon. When the film was released, it was immediately lambasted for feeling like two different films mashed together and it led to a strong contingent of DC fans asking for the Zack Snyder cut of the film. And, of course, the digital issues with Henry Cavill’s mustache did not help with the film’s reception at all.

John Rocha and Social Media Manager Dorian Parks sit down to talk about this news and offer their thoughts for why the film failed to live up to expectations. They also explore if this is the end of this version of the DCEU and if Warner Bros. and DC might have learned their lessons from this experience as they walk into their next slate of films highlighted recently by the hiring of Ava DuVernay for Jack Kirby’s ‘New Gods’.

[chorus]
i told you once i swear to god i don't need you
and i wrote that on my heart to see the words bleed through
let the fire fall as you put down your cigarette
you know that i always hated that shit

[hook]
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
(you're my weakness)

[verse 1]
i seem to be trying i am but see you're used to that
you call when you need me, i'll hesitate and call you back
and i'll say i'm sorry like its overdue, and i'm over you
but i won't believe it, spill me your secrets, i'll keep them close

[hook]
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness


[verse 2]
wear excuses on my sleeve
hide my heart for you to keep
i've been falling for you slow, you know
i've been falling for you slow
forgot where to begin
after all of this you know, i'm in
i've been falling for you slow
i went out on a limb
after all of this you know

[hook]
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
you're my weakness
(you're my weakness)

[chorus]
i told you once i swear to god i don't need you
and i wrote that on my heart to see the words bleed through

Homebrew on the Horizon

Nintendo has a new console, and it's more secure than ever.

The Switch was released less than a year ago, and we've been all over it.

Nintendo has designed a custom OS that is one of the most secure we've ever seen, making the game harder than it has ever been before.

In this talk we will give an introduction to the unique software stack that powers the Switch, and share our progress in the challenge of breaking it. We will talk about the engineering that went into the console,  and dive deep into the security concepts of the device.

The talk will be technical, but we aim to make it enjoyable also for non-technical audiences.
