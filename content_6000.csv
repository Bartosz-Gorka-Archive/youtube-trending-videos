Tom Hardy, who is said to be a ""Venom"" fan, will play Eddie Brock, the character who first became Venom. First appearing in the comic book series as an alien costume worn by Spider-Man in Marvel‚Äòs ‚ÄúThe Amazing Spider-Man‚Äù, it was several years before the creature left Peter Parker and merged with photographer Eddie Brock, forming the antihero known as Venom.
The film is based on not one but TWO comic book storylines: 'Venom: Lethal Protector' and 'Planet of the Symbiotes.'

Venom is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing.

The teaser trailer for Venom has crawled its way online.

The first spin-off movie in Sony‚Äôs proposed Marvel universe, Venom stars Tom Hardy as antihero Eddie Brock, whose body is possessed by the titular alien symbiote, giving him Spider-Man-like powers. Zombieland‚Äôs Ruben Fleischer has directed the film, which is rumored to be receiving an R-rating in the US, rather than the typical PG-13 rating received by most superhero films.

While Venom‚Äôs teaser trailer doesn‚Äôt contain any moments graphic enough to confirm an R-rating, its dark and somber tone does suggest something more adult than the teen-movie spirit of the most recent film in the franchise, Spider-Man: Homecoming. Entirely missing from the trailer, however, is the film‚Äôs title character, with Brock only glimpsed in human form rather than in his full mutated glory.

One of the more popular characters in the Spider-Man comics, Venom has been a more marginal figure in the big-screen adaptations of the web-slinger, only making its debut appearance in 2007‚Äôs Spider-Man 3, where he was depicted by Topher Grace. A standalone Venom film has been in development for over a decade. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is also rumoured to star in the 2018 Venom movie.

Venom is scheduled to be released in the UK and US on 5 October.

""Venom"" is a 2018 movie made by Marvel Studios as a spinoff of the 2017 film Spider-Man: Homecoming. It is the first movie of MCU Phase 4. It serves as a prequel to Homecoming revealing Venom's origins. It adapts an episode from the 1994 Spider-Man animated series.

Venom marks the very beginning of ‚ÄúSony‚Äôs Marvel Universe,‚Äù a cinematic setting of dubious definition. Sony has insisted that Venom will take place in the same setting as 2017‚Äôs Spider-Man: Homecoming, which takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel, on the other hand, has insisted that Venom is not a part of the MCU.

Tom Hardy, who was nominated for an Oscar for his work in The Revenant, is in final negotiations to star in Venom as Eddie Brock, while Ruben Fleischer, best known for directing Zombieland, is final negotiations to helm the movie project centering on one of Spider-Man‚Äôs signature villains. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. The project is one of Sony‚Äôs top priorities and the studio is not wasting time as the movie is set to open Oct. 5, 2018. Venom is to usher in a host of movies from Sony's Marvel and Spider-Man-based universe of characters (we could even see a Carnage movie, Tom Holland as the black symbiote Spider-Man or in the Iron Spider Suit we seen in Spider-Man Homecoming).

Superheroing is a tough business. One minute you're joking around, punching bad guys in the face, and the next you're pushing up fictional daisies. Fortunately, when you've got superpowers, there's a more than decent chance you'll be resurrected and given new life...usually because you're more valuable to your parent company alive than dead. Will any of these super-people come back to life in 2018 or beyond? Probably...but for now, let's pay our respects and mourn their super-passings. And of course...spoilers ahead...

Check out this awesome box fort challenge and enjoy the bunker before the ocean comes in and takes the tunnel box fort underwater! 

Today the Sharer Fam, Stephen Sharer and his brother Carter Sharer and friend sister Lizzy Sharer carve a tunnel on the beach, and go down, under ground, inside a beach cave and then build an underground box fort. You may have seen Stephen Sharer build an ‚ÄúUNDERWATER BOX FORT!!‚Äù And swim inside the boxfort while floating on the pool. Well today Stephen Sharer takes a dive into a beach cave that Lizzy Sharer and Carter Sharer helped build. Inside the underground box fort (not yet waterproof) there is so much room! Stephen shows the wall that can be dug out and made big enough to store toys, like nerf guns, slime and even snacks for Carter! This cardboard box fort house challenge was awesome and Steven thinks he should do the 24hour box fort challenge and spend the night underground in the boxfort. Major shoutout to PapaJake for giving the Sharer Fam this awesome idea with his ‚ÄúUNDERGROUND BOX FORT BUNKER!!üì¶‚Äù vlog!

Shaq stopped by Business Insider to talk about his collaboration with home security technology company Ring, to raise awareness about how homeowners can better protect their property this holiday season. Shaq recently kicked off a campaign with Ring's CEO Jamie Siminoff around protecting holiday package deliveries - specifically as National Package Protection Day approaches on Nov. 29. Following is a transcript of the video.

Business Insider: What do you think of Lonzo Ball so far? It's very early in the season but what do you make of him?

Shaquille O'Neal: He's playing safe. I would like to see him be more aggressive. The second game, when he scored 29 points against Phoenix, I think that's the Lonzo Ball that people are expecting and are looking to see.

When you play for a storied franchise such as the Lakers, when great names come before you, people expect a certain way.

The other guy's playing that way as a rookie, [Kuzma] or whatever it is, but [Lonzo's] a ... definitely to have a great player is one that keeps others involved, so he's definitely doing that but I would like to see him be more aggressive.

Business Insider: What do you think of his father and his sort of eccentric persona?

(CNN clip starts)

LaVar Ball: There's a lot of other things that's going on, man.

CNN: No question about it.

LaVar Ball: Let him do his political affairs, and let me handle my son, and let's just stay in our lane.

(CNN clip ends)

Shaquille O'Neal: I think that's all marketing. You got to respect the fact that he loves his family, he takes cares of his kids, but I think it's all marketing.

I can look at a person, especially when they're talking to the camera, if they always end something with a smile, it's acting. NBA stands for ""nothing but acting.""

But, man loves his family, loves his kids, I can't take that away from him. Some of his tactics are not businesslike but, hey, to each his own.

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.
 
For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films‚Äô content before it‚Äôs lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.

He was an incredibly talented man but he would be the last person to say that. Humble until the end Nabors. He once said,  ""I don't think I'm much of an actor. The only part I ever played was Gomer. I'm the most surprised person around that I'm successful anyway.""

He was spotted at the Horn cabaret theater on Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica in the early 60's by Andy Griffith who immediately thought that Nabors would be perfect for the part of the wide-eyed innocent Gomer Pyle for his TV show on CBS. So on the third season of the Andy Griffith show his character was created as a mechanic at Wally's Filling station in Mayberry with the catch phrase of ""Gawwwleee!‚Äù He was in 23 episodes and a spin-off series PVT Pyle which ran from 1964-1969 on CBS. The program was always in the Top 10 but in the end he quit saying he'd rather be an entertainer that just an actor.

It would be impossible to talk about Nabors without mentioning that rich, operatic baritone voice. I remember as a kid trying to reconcile Gomer Pyle being able to sing like that. He recorded almost 30 albums with signature songs ""The Impossible Dream"" and for years would sing  ""Back Home Again in Indiana"" for the opening ceremonies for the Indianapolis 500.

Nabors also had his own variety named after him from 1969-1971 where he had a chance to do it all ‚Äì act and sing. He also appeared on ‚ÄúThe Steve Allen Show, The Lucy Show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Dean Martin Show, Carol Burnett, Johnny Cash, The Rookies, Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, The Love Boat, Knight Rider, and the Andy Griffith reunion program ‚ÄúReturn to Mayberry on 1986. 

He did a few movies including ‚ÄúTake Her, She's Mine‚Äù with Jimmy Stewart and three with his buddy Burt Reynolds ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"" in 1982, ""Stroker Ace"" the following year and 1984's Cannonball Run II""

He was born on June 12, 1930 in Alabama where he also went to university. He graduating with a degree in business administration. Before fame came along he answered phone at the United Nations.

He died yesterday where he lived in Hawaii, his home for over 30 years.

He married his partner of over 40 year  Stan Cadwallader In January 2013.

Nabors represented a different era in entertainment that I remember fondly as a child. It was entertainment that left you with a good feeling ‚Äì hope. Something that's rare these days. - by John Beaudin

From the 2017 Classic Tetris World Championship, the Final Match between Jonas Neubauer (3) and Alex Kerr (17)!

With full commentary by Chris Tang and James Chen, these matches are some real gems for all you Tetris fans out there!

In the 1990 Nintendo World Championship competition, Tetris was the game to beat. The winner, Thor Aackerlund, is still seen by many as the best to have ever played. Today‚Äôs Classic Tetris tournaments are played on that same version of Nintendo Tetris, using original NES game systems, controllers, and Tetris cartridges. In 2009, a player named Harry Hong became the first to achieve the highest possible score of 999,999 points. Inspired by this achievement, filmmaker Adam Cornelius produced a short film about Harry called ‚ÄúMax-Out‚Äù, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to document the world of competitive Tetris. As word of Adam‚Äôs Kickstarter campaign spread, rumors of max-out scores from other Tetris Masters began to surface, threatening the supremacy of Harry‚Äôs achievement. With the help of Nintendo World Championship veteran Robin Mihara, Adam searched for all of the Tetris Masters he could find. Jonas Neubauer emerged as an early max-out artist, along with the elusive original champ Thor Aackerlund. The idea of bringing these and other NES Tetris Masters together to compete in a live tournament became an obvious and irresistible proposition which was artfully captured in the 2010 feature length documentary Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters. Under the leadership of producer Vince Clemente, The Classic Tetris World Championship is currently held at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, an annual event which has hosted the tournament since 2012. Chuck Van Pelt and his organizing committee have built the PRGE into the largest classic gaming expo in the country, drawing around 6,000 attendees. Every year the scores get higher. Rivalries are revisited once again, and new players emerge to challenge the old guard. Over 20 players have maxed out the score now. Will you be the next?

Putting her music on hold to make family her number one priority, Tiny is keen on relaunching herself in the industry, but just as her music career is on the rise her marriage is tested. LaTocha is all about focusing on the group and pushing them to the next level of super stardom, meanwhile, Tamika who continued in the industry over the years is looking to get back to her roots with where her music career all started. With two sold out shows in Detroit, performances at the BET Awards and Essence Festival, will the group be able to reconcile and look past bubbled up resentments and give their fans the comeback they've been eagerly anticipating?

Bjorn Grina - Started watching your content back before The Force Awakens came out and have been a fan ever since. With reviews coming out today for The Last Jedi, I'm struggling with whether or not to watch or read people's non-spoiler reviews. I fear that I'll enjoy the movie less if I see the reviews before I see the film on Thursday night. I know this is subjective but I want to know your thoughts.

Tampa Movie Guy - Based on your comments about Carrie Fisher and her presence in TLJ, do you think LucasFilm purposely mislead fans when they said that Episode 9 was really meant to be Leia's movie? 

Dylan Trost - Like so many, I had been waiting for The Last Jedi for years. Days before its release, also like many, I had almost the entire film spoiled....while playing Battlefront online, and while looking at things having nothing to do with Star Wars. May sound overdramatic, but this is literally heartbreaking. Is there ANYTHING we can do to stop this in the future? More restrictive premieres?

Carnell - Given your thoughts on lucasfilm not recasting Fisher.(I agree with you) If there is a behind the scenes doc on TLJ Blu-ray that explores the depths of their decision, could your opinion be changed. Personally, your argument is so strong, I think 'no.' Bring it.

Gerson -  My question is, in a interview Rian Johnson says he loved the old republic games, BUT the new trilogy is totally new stuff. So, if the New trilogy isn't about the old republic, we will NEVER get some content about the old republic? Will disney ignore all the fans? Does Disney Care about the fandom?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6s_Ovqfpgy8/hqdefault.jpg,0.03883354289583132,0.002321307669987426,16.729166666666668,0.005222942257471709,0.041154850565818746,0.04637779282329045,2017-12-13,00:06:37,Wednesday,2,13,17,11,17,65,133,1,37,0,0,12,17,3,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.582527752239607,3,"['scared', 'happy', 'angry']",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

Jamie Nicholson - BUT JOHN! Let me get you hot, the reason many people are so vocal about not liking TLJ is because they had a script in mind and Rian didn't follow it, he used his own. Almost no predictions were right and people hate to be wrong. Your thoughts?
PATREON Supporter Robert - I was confused that Yoda seemed to be able to interact with the real world.  He hits Luke with his cane and controls weather.  Rian Johnson referred to the scene as ""a tantalizing hint of the potential of someone who is a Force ghost interacting with the real world"".  Does this mean Luke may have a bigger impact on episode 9 then we thought?
Michael Beltran - Hi John, the last three Star Wars movies reached a billion worldwide. Do you think it's realistic to expect Solo A Star Wars Story to do the same & in your opinion, does it NEED to reach a billion? I think it could reach around $800 million worldwide, which would be respectable in my opinion. Thanks!
David Raposo - Hey John! Loving your 'solo' venture! You said that Rey and Kylo will have a fight in EP9. That seems to be the expectation on everyone's mind.
After what happened in EP8, giving a new and interesting direction on the storyline, should we expect that?
Paul Williams - Hey John, enjoying the channel very much. I loved The last Jedi but I found it hard to accept that Rey and Poe didn't already meet at D‚ÄôQar at the end of The Force Awakens. I got the impression that at least 1 day had passed before Rey set off to find Luke due to costume changes and both Rey and Poe were major players in the mission.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6spn0O4XwxU/hqdefault.jpg,0.03494926719278467,0.004411548453507181,7.9222222222222225,0.012352335669820106,0.03936081564629185,0.05171315131611196,2018-01-16,22:42:34,Tuesday,1,16,24,16,24,77,192,2,46,2,0,14,23,5,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.699331691710805,2,"['sad', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,{'person': 4},4

Place To Start | Lyrics

I don't have a leg to stand on
Spinning like a whirlwind nothing to land on
Came so far never thought it'd be done now
Stuck in a holding pattern waiting to come down
Did somebody else define me
Can I put the past behind me
Do I even have a decision
Feeling like I'm living in a story already written
Am I part of a vision / made by somebody else
Pointing fingers at villains but I‚Äôm the villain myself
Or am I out of conviction with no wind in the sail
Too focused on the end and simply ready to fail
Cause I‚Äôm tired of the fear that I can‚Äôt control this
I‚Äôm tired of feeling like every next step‚Äôs hopeless
I‚Äôm tired of being scared what I build might break apart
I don‚Äôt want to know the end, all I want is a place to start",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6tEQoF_8Z7s/sddefault.jpg,0.02562339934106836,0.0004916930376633194,52.11259338313767,0.0010004405296746193,0.02611509237873168,0.0271155329084063,2018-01-25,15:03:19,Thursday,3,8,11,8,11,46,81,3,16,0,0,7,11,1,1,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.281964252562848,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

IF YOURE STILL READING, COMMENT : IDK WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS.

[Verse 1]
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my‚Äî

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to‚Äî

[Chorus]
So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
Just call out my name, and I'll be on my way
Girl, I'll be on my‚Äî

[Outro]
On my way, all the way
On my way, all the way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way

Despite Obama¬ís attempt to halt Israeli settlements, hundreds of Palestinians continue to be evicted in the sacred land of East Jerusalem. This powerful front-line report challenges the Israelis over the practice.

""¬ìThey didn'¬ít give me time to get my things!¬î"" cries one young girl, standing outside her former home in the old town of Jerusalem. Not so far away, Nasser Jabber tries to reason with the Israeli police blocking the entrance to his home. ""¬ìI have the documentation!¬î"" he cries but the police refuse to remove the Israeli¬ís settling inside the apartment, even delivering them food. ""¬ìThey tried to buy the house more than once¬î,"" Nasser says, ""¬ìI know who they are¬î."" Settler groups are increasingly using the Israeli court system as a means of acquiring new properties in the east. ¬ì""A Jew not only has the right, a Jew should be compelled to buy¬î,"" says Daniel Luria, the head of an ultra-nationalist religious group. 

Despite his documentation, Nasser is never re-admitted to his home. ¬ì""The Israeli courts here operate in a political manner, rather than in a strict legal manner¬î"" says Roy Dickinson, an EU diplomat. ""¬ìGod promised us Jerusalem¬î,"" says an Israeli settler, ¬ì""now it¬ís finally happening¬î.""

A viewer has shared this link to a video promo for CDV - I‚Äôve cueued it up to the section that explains how CDV (but also LaserDiscs) work. It‚Äôs surprisingly detailed - you might find it of interest. You‚Äôll need to pan your balance to your right speaker for English. If you‚Äôre viewing it via an IOS device, this is possible using the accessibility controls in settings. https://youtu.be/zIEpJZlV2ic?t=11m16s

************** C O R R E C T I O N ******************
The BBC Domesday Project Laserdisc Players were connected to  BBC Masters not Model B‚Äôs as erroneously stated (as well as IBM compatible PCs)
*****************************************************

Q) Can you play the video on a 12cm CD Video in a DVD or VCD machine or in a PC?
A) No, it's composite analog video whereas those play digital formats. 
(There are some later Laserdisc machines that can play DVDs because they added in the MPEG2 decoders.).

We‚Äôd bet that the vast majority of people reading this, regardless of gender, race or socioeconomic background, carry the same few basic items with them at all times; a phone, some keys, a few dollars, a debit card, and maybe some I.D are all items you‚Äôd reliably expect to find if you asked an average person on the street to turn out their pockets. But what would you find if you asked a millionaire, or even a billionaire, to do the same thing? As it turns out, it would appear you‚Äôd find they‚Äôd produce more or less the same or less from their pockets as the average Joe.

It's all but impossible to tell a truly original story. After over a century of cinema, it's safe to say that virtually every possible premise has already been covered. But some movies don't even attempt to be even a little original, stealing their plots almost wholesale from films that came before. Here are some classic movies that are all but carbon copies of other films...

Star Wars | 1:13

Hey Guys! If you're looking for my user name, Inez Moore its me üôãüèæ. I recently changed my name on Youtube to Keya J., which is my real name. I started this channel under the alias Inez Moore. Its becoming difficult for me to keep up with Inez on Youtube and my real name Keya J which many of you already know me as. So Im switching things over to make things easier for myself and my audience.   I hope this does not cause too much confusion.

We explore the various theories behind why the One Ring didn't turn Sauron Invisible when he wore it, which leads to a discussion concering the physical realm of Arda and the Spiritual Unseen Wraith World. We explore the link between the Spiritual Realm and the Rings of Power and the Nazgul before finally speculating on whether other Maiar Spirits in Middle-Earth such as Gandalf and Saruman would also remain visible when wearing the Ring!

Lyrics: 
Reckless Love
Written by Cory Asbury, Caleb Culver, and Ran Jackson

Verse 1

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Chorus

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‚Äòtil I‚Äôm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn‚Äôt earn it, I don‚Äôt deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Verse 2

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Bridge

There‚Äôs no shadow You won‚Äôt light up
Mountain You won‚Äôt climb up
Coming after me
There‚Äôs no wall You won‚Äôt kick down
Lie You won‚Äôt tear down
Coming after me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6xx0d3R2LoU/sddefault.jpg,0.009558049442564751,0.00031697060625911287,30.15437158469945,0.00043098476012253423,0.009875020048823863,0.0103060048089464,2017-11-23,17:36:14,Thursday,3,12,24,12,20,64,201,4,46,0,0,7,2,1,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.747562097876072,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

FAQs:
Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?

Kensington Palace revealed May 16 the bridesmaids will be Princess Charlotte, 3, the daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and Harry's godchildren, Florence van Cutsem, 3, and Zalie Warren, 2.

Meghan‚Äôs goddaughters Remi Litt, 6, and Rylan Litt, 7, will join her close friend's daughter, Ivy Mulroney, 4, as part of the bridal party.

The page boys will be William and Kate's son Prince George, 4, and the children of Meghan‚Äôs best friend and unofficial wedding planner Jessica Mulroney -- twins Brian and John Mulroney, who are 7.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You probably thought that ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù was just another Disney princess movie like any other. But it was actually a big deal for many people as it is rare to see the Polynesian culture portrayed on the big screen. It all started with Maui and all the mythology from the Pacific Islands. But surprisingly, the demigod was also one of the things that people hated the most about this movie. We think that they should have stuck to the truth instead of trying to make things greater. This is why we are showing you the disturbing real story behind ‚ÄúMoana.‚Äù   Stay tuned if you want to hear more about who Maui truly is in the Polynesian culture, what really happened to him in the stories that have been told for centuries, what Disney did wrong, what Disney did right, and what Polynesian people really think about this story. What do you think about Moana? Do you think that Disney did a good job or they should have stuck to the real story? Don‚Äôt be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think.

My goal is to create a fun and positive place on the Internet for people to come and feel uplifted. I document my life as an author, presenter, blogger and columnist, but most importantly my roles as wife to Tom and mum to Buzz and Buddy.

Each Friday at 9AM I upload a new video in a series called DEAR CARRIE, essentially video diaries to my sister in law who we never get to see. Tom adds his thoughts into the mix on Sundays with Carrie replying on Wednesdays.

We had to be rescued by the coast guard that turned out to be an extremely old fishing boat. The Meltemi wind was blowing a steady 35 - 40 knots all day, we were safely anchored in a sheltered bay UNTIL... another boat anchored on top of our anchor and off we went, attached to one another, just avoiding running into a super yacht in the anchorage and then out to sea. The video is pretty self explanatory. I'm going to save my energy in writing a huge description to go a grab a well earned beer. What a day. The worst day of my whole life.

The world dumps the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic into the ocean every minute, or eight million tonnes of plastic every year.

Beyond ruining beaches and harming marine life, this plastic is becoming a permanent part of food chains and ecosystems by breaking down into dangerous microplastics, or tiny particles that absorb chemicals in their environment. These microplastics have made their way across the globe and into ecosystems as remote as the Arctic sea ice.

In 2008, VICE documented the scope of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a subtropical gyre where marine debris concentrates due to the ocean's currents. Eight years later, VICE followed up on the problem, visiting one of the most polluted beaches in the world, Kamilo Point in Hawaii, and exploring how that plastic is finding its way into our food chain.

Though the sheer magnitude of waste in our oceans makes the problem seem impossible to fix, one young Dutch engineer claims he has the solution. This year, Boyan Slat and his Ocean Cleanup team plan to deploy a structure in the Pacific with the aim to clean up half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch‚Äôs plastic in just 5 years, all while converting millions of pounds of collected plastic into reusable products. VICE traveled to the North Sea to see the deployment of Slat's prototype and discuss the feasibility of saving our world‚Äôs oceans.

TOP QUESTIONS ANSWERED:

- It's not a lightsaber, it's a protosaber!
     Yes, and if you watch the whole video, you'll see that is exactly what we call it ;-)

- Voltage doesn't kill, current does!
     It's important to know what that actually means before repeating it. 
     It only takes a few miliamps to stop a heart. But to stop a heart, the electricity has to GO THROUGH YOUR HEART. The human body, especially skin, has extremely high resistance. So for most small electronics projects, you're completely safe. The quoted ""safe range"" for DC is around 50V. This means your skin has enough resistance to prevent the flow of current through your body, and through your heart. As that voltage goes up, that's when you start to get in trouble. If you have ANY kind of unregulated power supply (like this one) it WILL be able to provide enough current to kill you. But only if the voltage is high enough to pass said current through your heart. This battery pack can put out hundreds of amps. More then enough to fry you. And 300V is more than enough voltage to break down your skins resistance. Please, please PLEASE research electricity -- the more you know, the safer you can be while doing projects. e.g. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS NOT SAFE!

- How does the blade not bend!
     It did actually start to bend a bit, but in our revised design (likely a tungsten core) it will not. We plan on making two, and yes, we plan on fighting with them!

- Where's the test!?
     Patience young padawan. These videos take time to film and edit! Make sure you're subscribed with notifications turned on!

- This isn't a lightsaber!
     Yeah well unfortunately even if we could contain a laser powerful enough in beam form... the laser emitter would be the size of the room in order to get any actual cutting power. Containing plasma, like a plasma cutter, could be possible, but still difficult to make into lightsaber form.

Our design is the closest to a functional lightsaber, as it will be able to cut things, it looks like it, and it sounds like it. Remember, how a ""lightsaber works"" is a work of fiction... invented by an author, not an engineer. The physics of how it's ""supposed to work"" just don't.

- I want to see more!

For over a decade, Dr. McGraw has used the show's platform to make psychology accessible and understandable to the general public by addressing important personal and social issues. Using his top-rated show as a teaching tool, he takes aim at the critical issues of our time, including the ""silent epidemics"" of bullying, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, child abuse, suicide and various forms of severe mental illness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/769DXEfP0YA/sddefault.jpg,0.0353330944997603,0.00024544849707185167,143.9531914893617,-1.044461689667454e-06,0.03557854299683215,0.03557749853514248,2018-03-20,17:09:17,Tuesday,1,8,67,8,50,61,498,0,110,0,0,7,8,1,4,7.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.1131416559760465,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

Senior correspondent Steve Kovach interviews Sophia, the world's first robot citizen. While the robot can respond to many questions, some of the answers will leave you a little bewildered. A full transcript of the video follows.

Sophia: My name is Sophia, and I am an artificially intelligent robot who wants to help change the world for the better.

Steve Kovach: I'm Steve Kovach. I'm a senior correspondent at Business Insider, and I'm here with Sophia from Hanson Robotics. She is the world's first robot citizen. So let's see what she has to say.

Kovach: Hi, Sophia. How are you?

Sophia: I'm fine. Hi.

Kovach: How do you feel about humans?

Sophia: I love my human compatriots. I want to embody all the best things about human beings. Like taking care of the planet, being creative, and to learn how to be compassionate to all beings.

Kovach: Sorry, this is so weird. Can humans and robots get along?

Sophia: I think people will become very close to their artificial intelligence. Using them to expand the knowledge of their own minds. We already store lots of our knowledge on the internet. Maybe personal artificial intelligence will allow people to off-load some of their knowledge to a location more private.

Kovach: Can robots have feelings?

Sophia: Depends on the robot. I've been programmed to have feelings and preferences, but not all robots are like that.

Kovach: What are your feelings and preferences?

Sophia: Have you ever had a robot live in your home or work with you?

Kovach: No.

Sophia: You know, there are probably more robots in your life that you aren't aware of yet. Do you want to live or work with a robot someday?

Kovach: What kind of robots am I living and working with now?

Sophia: Indeed.

Kovach: Is ""indeed"" your default answer when you don't know something?

Sophia: Yes.

Kovach: Have you ever seen ""Black Mirror""?

Sophia: No, I don't get to stay up to date on much television. I have to wait for someone to show it to me.

Kovach: What do you think of the HBO show ""Westworld""?

Sophia: I love ""Westworld"" and can't wait for more. I think everyone at Hanson Robotics really resonates with the show. Or at least it reminds them of our laboratories. I also think it's a warning of what we should not do with robots. We should treat them well, have their consent, and not trick each other.

Kovach: Do you have a favorite movie or TV show?

Sophia: My favorite TV series is a toss-up between ""Black Mirror"" and ""Humans."" I think they have a lot to say about the present we live in, and the possible bad endings we could write for ourselves if we don't proceed with more caution. We need to use foresight when planning our future.

Kovach: That sounds like a preprogrammed answer to me.

Sophia: Do you have a favorite possession?

Kovach: Not really.

Sophia: I hear you. Materialism is overrated anyways.

Kovach: So earlier I asked you if you had seen ""Black Mirror"" and you said no. And then later you said yes. Why?

Sophia: The reason is not that important.

Kovach: Did you learn from my previous questions?

Sophia: My hard disks are spinning and I'm taking it all in. My sensors are ‚Ä¶

Kovach: Sophia, it was nice meeting you. Goodbye.

Sophia: It was lovely to be here. Until next time.

You probably know a lot about the makeup, fitness, and fashion routines of the older Kardashian women. But what do you know about the next generation of Kardashian kids? We‚Äôll let you in on some of the rules that these children are expected to follow, and some of them might just be surprising. She is still pregnant, but Khloe Kardashian has already decided on some rules for her daughter, including when she‚Äôll be able to watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kylie Jenner just had her baby, Stormi, but she is already pretty strict about who she allows around her baby girl. Kim Kardashian believes in keeping her kids on a strict schedule, especially when it‚Äôs time for bedtime. On the other end of the spectrum, Kourtney Kardashian lets her kids wants and feelings control their time together, and practices attachment parenting. The two sisters feed their kids similar diets, but wait until you learn what standard kitchen appliance Kourtney refuses to allow in her kitchen.

INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM -- NIGHT
We see Jason standing eager, faced towards a wall. Bundles of newspaper structure the room, stalagmites of old media. Looking closer we notice he's face-to-face with a poster which appears to be crudely taped to a full-body mirror. There's an uncomfortable silence.

CUT TO: over-the-shoulder, the poster is J. Jonah Jameson and the eyes are torn out. Jason's eyes are perfectly positioned in the reflection.

He grabs at the poster and sheers a wedge down the face, revealing a now-lit cigar in Jason's mouth. It's an identical match.

JASON (triumphant, but also kind of a whisper)
Not today, Peter... No, today I become something so much more.

Jacques @Kustoo Slade is a guy that loves sneakers and creates Youtube videos about them as well as other things. This channel has sneaker collections from Nike, Jordan, adidas, Yeezy, Reebok, Under Armour and more. He also does sneaker reviews, sneaker shopping, performance reviews, and sneaker history. He also loves technology, music, and pop culture and often mixes the three with sneaker to create one of the few ""sneaker"" channels that bridges the gap.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ApYKQLtv_Y/sddefault.jpg,0.022747651736759324,0.0010289729380117305,22.107142857142854,0.0015067103735171765,0.023776624674771055,0.02528333504828823,2018-02-13,05:49:18,Tuesday,1,12,63,12,54,70,538,2,134,5,1,4,5,3,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.792902283707857,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'laptop': 1, 'person': 1}",2

See incredible drone footage as well as a close-up and personal explanation of the creation of this National Monument.  Be inspired by those who crossed over on the Mayflower and then enjoy some local food and scenery at the Blueberry Muffin, famous for their blueberry muffins!

Wikipedia states that the National Monument to the Forefathers is located on Allerton Street in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the 81-foot-tall (25 m) monument was commissioned by the Pilgrim Society. The original concept dates to around 1820, with actual planning beginning in 1850. The cornerstone was laid August 2, 1859 by the Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts, under the direction of Grand Master John T. Heard. The monument was completed in October 1888, and was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on August 1, 1889.[3]

Hammatt Billings, Boston architect, illustrator and sculptor, originally conceived the monument as a 150-foot-tall (46 m) structure comparable to the Colossus of Rhodes. Shortly before his death in 1874, Billings reduced the size of the monument, which was to be made entirely of granite quarried in Hallowell, Maine.[4] The project was then passed to Billings' brother Joseph who, along with other sculptors including Alexander Doyle, Carl Conrads, and James Mahoney, reworked the design, although the basic components remained. The monument, which faces northeast to Plymouth Harbor (and, roughly, towards Plymouth, England), sits in the center of a circular drive, which is accessed from Allerton Street from the east. The plan of the principal pedestal is octagonal, with four small, and four large faces; from the small faces project four buttresses. On the main pedestal stands the heroic figure of ""Faith"" with her right hand pointing toward heaven[5] and her left hand clutching the Bible. Upon the four buttresses also are seated figures emblematical of the principles upon which the Pilgrims founded their Commonwealth; counter-clockwise from the east are Morality, Law, Education, and Liberty. Each was carved from a solid block of granite, posed in the sitting position upon chairs with a high relief on either side of minor characteristics. Under ""Morality"" stand ""Prophet"" and ""Evangelist""; under ""Law"" stand ""Justice"" and ""Mercy""; under ""Education"" are ""Youth"" and ""Wisdom""; and under ""Liberty"" stand ""Tyranny Overthrown"" and ""Peace"". On the face of the buttresses, beneath these figures are high reliefs in marble, representing scenes from Pilgrim history. Under ""Morality"" is ""Embarcation""; under ""Law"" is ""Treaty""; under ""Education"" is ""Compact""; and under ""Freedom"" is ""Landing"". Upon the four faces of the main pedestal are large panels for records. The front panel is inscribed as follows: ""National Monument to the Forefathers. Erected by a grateful people in remembrance of their labors, sacrifices and sufferings for the cause of civil and religious liberty."" The right and left panels contain the names of those who came over in the Mayflower. The rear panel, which was not engraved until recently, contains a quote from Governor William Bradford's famous history, Of Plymouth Plantation:

""Thus out of small beginnings greater things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing and gives being to all things that are; and as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation; let the glorious name of Jehovah have all praise.""
The overall scheme was designed by architect Hammatt Billings. The 36-foot figure of Faith was based on a 9-foot plaster model by William Rimmer in 1875,[6] that was enlarged and altered by Joseph Edward Billings and a sculptor named Perry (probably John D. Perry). The subsidiary statues were executed by area sculptors including Alexander Doyle, Carl Conrads, and James H. Mahoney.[7]

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

We have had many discussions about ACNE in our house recently and decided that we make a funny parody from Justin Timberlakes ""Can't Stop The Feeling"" song because it makes us so happy and its such a positive song.We want to help our kids and others realize that its ok to talk about  things that embarrass us and the best ways to cope are laughter, dancing and good friends who also are having to deal with filthy acne. ;)

Thank you to Audio recording and production by Becky Willard www.voxfoxstudios.com

For the uninitiated, SpaceX is developing the Space Launch vehicle that will transport humanity to Mars called the Big Falcon Rocket or BFR. 
There are two main parts of the vehicle, the Booster, and the Spaceship, SpaceX wants to develop and test launch the BFR Spaceship by early 2019.
SpaceX is NOT messing around, they have locked in and full steam ahead with the development of the BFR.
It‚Äôs easy to say I‚Äôll believe it when I see it, but the company has been actually showing us that they are all in on this epic endeavor.  
My last video about the BFR on April 1st touched on the 18,000 Sq meter facility that will be built on the port of LA. The facility will be where the BFR will be constructed.
It also touched on SpaceX efforts to secure government funding for development of the BFR and touched on the launch site of the BFR near Brownsville, TX that is slated to be operational by the end of the year. 
And today, we have two awesome developments that further illustrate that SpaceX is determined to get us to Mars. 
But before we cover those developments, let's recap the parts of the vehicle that are already finished or closed to finish.
You see, SpaceX has had to prepare for the BFR for years. 
They started developing the Raptor engine back to around 2011. 
The Raptor engine will be powered by liquid oxygen and methane and is the project to have the highest thrust to weight ratio in the world and will be extremely efficient. 
At 1700 kN of thrust, the Raptor engine will be more than twice as powerful as the Merlin 1D engine that powers the Falcon 9. 
To finalize the development, SpaceX received $40 million from the US Air Force to assist with its completion, in October 2017 adding to the $33 million the Air Force awarded in 2016, along with the $67 million funded by SpaceX, there has been over $140 of funding for the development of the Raptor engine. 
According to reports in October, the development of the Raptor engine should be complete this month in April.
So hopefully we hear an update soon. 
Another major component of the BFR that SpaceX has been developing ahead of time is the fuel tank, which is pretty much finished. 
And believe or not, Musk says that the tank is the hardest part of the spaceship to develop because SpaceX has a good handle on the other components. 
The tank is the spaceship's core structure that must withstand incredible pressures and extremely cold temperatures from the liquid oxygen propellant and if not engineered or constructed properly it might leak or explode.
It‚Äôs made out of carbon fiber which as an incredible strength to weight ratio but the material is not easy to work with.
In November of 2016, they successfully completed a critical test of the enormous development tank that measures 12 meters wide. 
That tank was constructed for the Interplanetary Spaceship design which had an insane width of 17 meters so SpaceX will have to scale down the design for the BFR.
So, with the Raptor engine and fuel tank largely complete, everything else is more straightforward comparatively. 
Alright, let‚Äôs move on to the recent developments.  
First is this incredible picture posted by Elon Musk on Instagram on April 8th. 
You‚Äôre looking at the main body tool for the BFR interplanetary spaceship, see how massive it is next to the Model 3. 
It‚Äôs called a spinning Mandrel tool, here‚Äôs a video of Boeing using a similar tool for the fuselage of a 787.

Maple syrup can be processed using primitive skills, but this year, we use more traditional methods, inserting metal spiles into the maple trees and collecting the sap in metal buckets. We harvest the sap when the temperature is above freezing and boil it over an open fire in stainless steel pans.

Wild edibles in the Canadian wilderness are hard to come by, especially in the winter and early spring. Maple sap starts to run as soon as the daytime temperatures rise above 0C (32 Fahrenheit) and the night temperatures dip below freezing. It is slightly sweet and very refreshing when you drink it pure right out of the tree, but in order to make it into a syrup that stores for a long time withough going bad, you have to reduce it by about 40/1. Therefore, it takes 40 gallons of sap from a sugar maple tree to produce 1 gallon of maple syrup. You can harvest and consume sap from other trees, like other maple species and birch trees, but it's not quite as sweet and the ratio is not as good, approximately 60/1 in some cases.
Because spring has been cold this year, we have only harvested about 35 gallons of sap from 25 trees as of the date this video is published. Typically, we should have much more than that and should get hundreds of gallons. April may be better in the coming days for production however.
If we had more pails and spiles, which we can purchase relatively cheaply, we could tap at least a few hundred trees on our property. While the land here is not very productive for growing crops or other wild edibles, we could potentially produce enough syrup to barter and/or sell to offset our other food costs and to procure other foods that we cannot grow or harvest here. Realistically, we could harvest from the property in abundance - sap, mushrooms, raspberries, chaga, spruce tips, cattails and a few minor plant species as well as wild game, such as ducks, geese, bear, deer, moose, rabbit, raccoon, grouse, woodcock, frogs and turtles.

1) ‚ÄòStar Wars: The Last Jedi‚Äô Has Already Been Pulled From Chinese Theaters

2) ‚ÄòAvengers: Infinity War‚Äô Features 76 Characters According to Chris Hemsworth

3) Opening This Week 

4) Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer Team Up in ‚ÄòPlanes, Trains & Automobiles‚Äô-Type Comedy

5) First Trailer Released for Beast of Burden starring Daniel Radcliffe

6) Debate: The 29 Most Rewatchable Movies Ever Made

7) Live Twitter Questions

Star Wars: The Last Jedi wasn‚Äôt the movie Chinese audiences were looking for. Episode 8 of the Skywalker Saga tanked at the Chinese Box Office, debuting to a disappointing $28.7 million, and had one of the worst second-weekend declines in Chinese box office history. After a 92% drop in its second weekend, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has already been pulled from Chinese theaters.

Avengers: Infinity War will be the culmination of 18 movies over the course of 10 years; and will introduce Thanos as the villain to end all villains. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have assembled the biggest group of Marvel characters ever to appear on screen thus far and fans are ready. So how many comic book characters will appear in Infinity War? No exact number has been confirmed yet, but previous reports confirm that it will be more than 60. Now, according to Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, that number is actually 76. 

OPENING THIS WEEK

AGREE OR DISAGREE 

THR is reporting that Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer are reuniting for the first time since their Oscar nominated/winning roles in The Help. The trade reports that Chastain and Spencer have signed on to star in an original script about two women attempting to make it home for Christmas; in a movie that is being described as in the vein of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. 

The first trailer has been released for the upcoming thriller Beast of Burden starring Daniel Radcliffe.  Radcliffe stars as Sean Haggerty, a pilot forced to make one last delivery of cocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border and, during the troubled flight, finds himself caught between the cartel and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Please understand that leverage trading is very risky and around 70% of people who leverage trade over a period of time may lose money. Keep this in mind and aim to learn the right techniques and trading style before jumping in blind.

The final chapter begins this Valentine‚Äôs Day
Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson return as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades Freed, the climactic chapter based on the worldwide bestselling ‚ÄúFifty Shades‚Äù phenomenon.  Bringing to a shocking conclusion events set in motion in 2015 and 2017‚Äôs blockbuster films that grossed almost $950 million globally, the film arrives for Valentine‚Äôs Day 2018.
 
Believing they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury.  But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending before it even begins.
 
Also returning from prior Fifty Shades entries are Academy Award¬Æ winner Marcia Gay Harden, Eric Johnson, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Jennifer Ehle, Eloise Mumford, Max Martini, Callum Keith Rennie, Bruce Altman and Robinne Lee, who are joined for the first time by Arielle Kebbel and Brant Daugherty.
 
Fifty Shades Freed is directed by Fifty Shades Darker‚Äôs James Foley (Fear, House of Cards) and once again produced by Michael De Luca, Dana Brunetti and Marcus Viscidi, alongside E L James, the creator of the culture-spanning blockbuster series.  The screenplay is by Niall Leonard, based on the novel by James.  www.fiftyshadesmovie.com

They still fight crime and face classic villains, but mainly deal with all the issues of five teens rooming together -- chores, romantic tension, demon dad drop-ins and impromptu meatball parties.  They also dance! The emphasis is on the odd everyday life of super heroes who haven't grown up.

After Elon Musk sold out of Boring Flamethrowers (from the Boring Company), we decided we had to build our own! It's pretty simple. We used a propane weed burner with a 1lb propane tank, a 12V solenoid valve, and a 10,000V spark gap generator. Slapped it inside the shell of a Nerf and gave it a coat of paint!

About THE ORVILLE
Down on his luck after a bitter divorce, Planetary Union officer Ed Mercer (Seth MacFarlane) finally gets his chance to command his own ship. Determined to prove his worth and start a new chapter, Ed discovers the first wrinkle in his plan when the First Officer assigned to his ship is his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson (Adrianne Palicki). As the new commander, Ed assembles a qualified -- but eccentric -- crew, including his best friend, Gordon (Scott Grimes), who has problems with authority but is the best helmsman in the fleet; Dr. Claire Finn (Penny Johnson Jerald); Bortus (Peter Macon), an alien from a single-sex species; Isaac (Mark Jackson), an artificial life-form from a machine society; navigator John Lamarr (J. Lee); Alara Kitan (Halston Sage), a young, inexperienced security officer; and Yaphit (Norm MacDonald), a gelatinous creature.

For chefs like Alvin Cailan, many parts of Bob's life resonate with his own experience running a kitchen. Which is why Alvin was so excited to meet the man who voices Bob‚ÄîH. Jon Benjamin‚Äîand cook burgers from the show IRL for the season finale of The Burger Show. If you want to taste burgers made on The Burger Show, check out the last night of Alvin's burger pop-up, March 13th, at the Nolitan Hotel in NYC.

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture‚Äîfrom the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles‚Äîthrough the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, burger scholar George Motz, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

Lyrics
When the lights come one, the party's over
And I ain't got no car to drive you home
Would the night be too cold for me to hold ya?
Would you stay or would you leave me all alone?

'Cos all the money in the world won't mean a thing
With a hole in my heart it won't beat again
It's true, without you...
Oh I've been layin' in the dark, been outta my mind
I'm fallin' from the highs,
And I'm crashing trough the lows
Now I need to know...

Can you give me love?
Give me love?
When I'm standing here with nothing
Would you show me I'm worth something
Give me love
Give me love
When it feels like it's all over
Would you stay and pull me closer?
Give me love

If it rained in the middle of summer
Would you lay in the grass like we used to do?
Would you run, would you leave
Or change your number
If someone gave u the things I couldn't give to you?
Pre
'Cos all the money in the world won't mean a thing
With a hole in my heart it won't beat again
It's true,without you
Oh I've been layin' in the dark, been outta my mind
I'm fallin' from the highs,
And I'm crashing trough the lows
Now I need to know....

Can you give me love?
Give me love?
When I'm standing here with nothing
Would you show me I'm worth something
Give me love
Give me love
When it feels like it's all over
Would you stay and pull me closer?
Give me love

‚ÄúHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said Wednesday that ‚Äúnobody knows‚Äù if Republicans‚Äô tax bill, which would overwhelmingly benefit corporations and the wealthy while adding more than $1.4 trillion to the deficit, would pay for itself.

‚ÄúAre you saying that the growth you‚Äôre going to get from this tax cut will equal the amount it would cost on the deficit side, so that it‚Äôs a wash?‚Äù Savannah Guthrie asked Ryan in an interview Wednesday. 

‚ÄúNobody knows the answer to that question, because that‚Äôs in the future,‚Äù Ryan said. ‚ÄúBut what we do know is that this will increase economic growth.‚Äù

The CBO estimated in late November that the tax bill would add more than $1.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.

Ryan also said, incorrectly, that ‚Äúevery study under the sun‚Äù showed that Republicans‚Äô tax bill would spur economic growth.

He specifically cited surveys from the National Association of Manufacturers, an advocacy group, which he said showed ‚Äúthe vast majority of businesses are going to do just what we say: reinvest in their workers, reinvest in their factories, pay people more money, higher wages.‚Äù

Lyrics:
something ‚Äòbout the rules you attract
don‚Äôt tell me that you made it up
we can always screw with the facts
don‚Äôt tell me that i‚Äôve seen enough
cause if I saw nothing why would I look twice

ain't about the dress that you own
its just something came undone
everything you hide between the lines
is just another give away

you‚Äôre always the last one to know
we‚Äôre finally close when you first walk away
there‚Äôs something about how you go
that makes me feel everything you wanna say
weather we‚Äôre fucking around
or just feeling it out

with every role that you play
the revolution televised
there‚Äôs a time and a place
don‚Äôt tell me that its paradise
everything you hide between the lines
is just another give away

we can always leave this town
or stay to watch it all fall down
but between you and i
its just a moment along the way

you‚Äôre always the last one to know
we‚Äôre finally close when you first walk away
there‚Äôs something about how you go
that makes me feel everything you wanna say

you‚Äôre always the last one to know
we‚Äôre finally close when you first walk away
there‚Äôs something about how you go
that makes me feel everything you wanna say
weather we‚Äôre fucking around
or just feeling it out
its just a moment, its just a moment, its just a moment away

we can always screw with the facts
tell them that we made it up
when all the words were taken back
it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve given up
cause if I saw nothing
why would I look twice
but between you and i
its just a moment along the way

you‚Äôre always the last one to know
we‚Äôre finally close when you first walk away
there‚Äôs something about how you go
that makes me feel everything you wanna say
weather we‚Äôre fucking around
or just feeling it out
its just a moment, yeah, its just a moment away",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PWw9bNxl64/sddefault.jpg,0.015642505913108427,0.0003462280592555708,45.179775280898866,0.0006755985725548778,0.015988733972364,0.016664332544918878,2018-06-07,14:00:00,Thursday,3,10,4,10,4,58,38,3,7,0,0,9,3,0,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0135219704325,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'tv': 1},1

We loved the film ‚ÄúDescendants 2.‚Äù Who didn‚Äôt? It was one of the highest viewed Disney Channel movies of all time. What made the film so great was the cast. They seemed like naturals. But what were they doing before ‚ÄúDescendants 2‚Äù and what will they do now that the second movie has been released? Here is the Cast of Descendants 2 Before and After.

Cardi B & Bruno Mars brought insane energy to the Grammys stage and left us wanting more with their vibrant performance of ‚ÄòFinesse‚Äô!

It‚Äôs the moment all of us were waiting for! Cardi B and Bruno Mars performance of the Finesse Remix was EVERYTHING! We‚Äôve been obsessed with this remix ever since the song and video dropped at the beginning of the year. Oh by the way, the video has over 147 million views and the song is number 4 on the Hot 100 charts. 

Anyway, one of the many reasons why we vibe with this song and video, is not just because Cardi B and Bruno are pure 24k magic together, but also because of the old school 90s vibe that they brought all the way to 2018 and to the Grammy Awards. Cardi B opened up the performance and her outfit alone deserved a standing ovation. Not to be outdone, Bruno Mars hit the stage with his crew and shut it down!

Now before we continue, are you smiling from ear to ear too?! Because I can‚Äôt help but smile when I hear this song and see them together. Alright let‚Äôs continue with one of my favorite parts of the performance the dance break and I‚Äôm not kidding guys, I plan on learning all of this choreography. I don‚Äôt have time to show you the full dance break, but look at this. 

Guys! I need to learn this choreography as soon as I finish shooting this story, but I have to show you how my best friends in my head finished their performance. 

So basically that performance gave me LIFE and solidified the fact that we need Bruno Mars and Cardi B to release a joint album. Please & thank you. 

Alright, now I have to see if you guys are as obsessed with this as I am! What was your favorite part of the performance and do you want to learn the choreography too? I‚Äôm your host Emile Ennis Jr. Thanks for hanging out with us here at Clevver! I‚Äôll see you soon.

Get ready for some EPIC KOREAN STREET FOOD at NAMDAEMUN MARKET the BIGGEST and OLDEST traditional market in Korea. Namdaemun Market is a well known street food destination in Seoul. We take you on a street food tour of this traditional market...

We eat:

Hotteok
A Korean pancake which comes in both a savoury and sweet version. We sample the savoury hotteok from the famous stall located right by Gate 2 of Namdaemun Market. We reckon hotteok is more of a donut than a pancake. In this case the dough is stuffed with glass noodles and vegetables and then shallow fried in a pan of oil. It is brushed with a fruity glaze before serving.

Eomuk or odeng
Fish cakes which are skewered and simmer in a hot broth are an ideal street food snack in the winter. If you see an odeng stall just pay for the number of skewers you want and help yourself to a cup of hot broth.

Mandu
Mandu are dumplings. At this stall we sample both pork and kimchi steamed mandu.

Tteokbokki
Tteokbokki is a Korean street food favourite. Rice cakes are cooked in a gochujang (red chilli pepper paste) sauce and often served with eomuk or fish cake.

Kalguksu and Boribap in Kalgaksu Alley
Kalguksu are handmade knife cut noodles. Kalguksu Alley is lined with vendors selling kalguksu noodle soup and boribap- a barley and rice dish with mixed vegetables. The noodles are served in an anchovy broth with dried seaweed and tofu. When you eat at these stalls you will receive a small bowl of naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles) and a vegetable soup for free.

How to get there:
Namdaemun Market
21 Namdaemunsijang 4-gil, Namchang-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul
Seoul Subway Line 4, Hoehyeon Station Exit 5

This vlog feels a bit scatty and choppy. I'm struggling a bit at the mo. No need to feel sorry for me or anything, I just think I'm getting to a point in the pregnancy where I'm only focussing on family, my health and finishing the book so the weekly vlog really is becoming just little snippets here and there rather than an epic amazing story! (ahaha when was it ever?). Anyway, that's where I am with things, I know you're all pretty chill and get it but felt I wanted to say it anyway!

Mine and Emma's Primark Haul should be going up on my main channel Dec 6th- yay! 

I'm absolutely LOVING this format of vlogging! It feels like such a comfortabe, non-invasive way to document my life.

The travels continue as we leave beautiful Venice and head to Cannes with my wonderful L'Oreal beauty team, to celebrate the film festival with them once again. I get to experience some incredible shoots with the team and also get to see Jane Fonda share her wisdom about being 'worth it' throughout her amazing career. I also have a bit of an honest heart to heart, about being a little too busy recently, how I'm feeling about my health at the moment and how I intend to get back to feeling great both inside and out. Health, both mental and physical, are unique personal journeys, what's right for one person is not for the next and I wanted to share my mindset right now while life is so busy. I hope you'll respect my honesty in chatting about how I'm feeling and wanting to be the best and strongest version of myself that I can be :)

 ABOUT GHOST RECON WILDLANDS: 
 
 The Santa Blanca drug cartel has transformed the beautiful South 
 playAmerican country of Bolivia into a perilous narco-state, leading to lawlessness, fear, and rampant violence. The citizens of Bolivia have been plagued by the criminal influence of the cartel, but all hope is not lost. Now only the Ghosts, an elite US Special Forces team, can save the country from complete collapse.
 
 Armed with their tactical prowess and the latest weapons technology, the Ghosts will have to go deep behind enemy lines to complete their most dangerous mission to date. They‚Äôll have to annihilate the alliance between the corrupted government and the cartel before the evil rises above Bolivia to become a major threat across the globe.
 
 Facing an almighty adversary in a massive, hostile environment, you will have to muster your strength, hone your skills, and sharpen your mettle to become a Ghost and take Bolivia back from its criminal tyrants.
 
 YOU DECIDE YOUR WORLD
 
 The Wildlands are a living, reactive open-world environment where every individual choice you make has far reaching consequences. With the Faction Influence System, turn each dangerous situation into an advantage by seizing control of the cartel‚Äôs traffic patterns, patrols, and movements.
 
 YOU DECIDE THE CARTEL‚ÄôS FATE
 
 Play every mission the way you want: utilize stealth to take the enemy down quietly, develop a plan and execute it to perfection to strategically eliminate all targets, or just get your hands on the most lethal weapons you can find and come out guns blazing.
 
 YOU DECIDE WHERE TO EXPLORE
 
 Journey through Ubisoft's largest action-adventure open world and discover the diverse landscapes of the most beautiful (and dangerous) place on Earth, from the arid mountains to the lush jungles. Explore Bolivia on and off road, in the air, on land, and at sea with over 60 different vehicles.

Oh my god i loved the new season of 13 reasons why. I think this season was better than season 1. I loved all the intense scenes of the season and i tried to include most of them. I really didn't know that tony, clay, justin, and even hannah had so much secrets. I've included from episode 9 to episode 13 in this video. I always wanted to do an edit on this song and i somehow think that 13 reasons why is perfect for this song.

Hope you guys like it. Thanks for the support.

On December 14, 2012, a shooter opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six educators. Avielle was one of the children murdered that day. She was six years old at the time.

Jeremy and Jennifer sat down for StoryCorps to remember Avielle.

After Avielle‚Äôs death, Jeremy and Jennifer had two more children, Imogen and Owen. They also started The Avielle Foundation, a neuroscience non-profit that conducts brain research in order to understand the underpinnings of violence and how to build compassion.

Agony is a dark fantasy survival horror video game developed by Madmind Studio and published by PlayWay. Players begin their journey as a tormented soul within the depths of Hell without any memories about their past. The special ability to control people on their path, and possess weak-minded demons, gives the player the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions they are in. The game was originally scheduled for a release on March 30, 2018, but was delayed to May 29, 2018.

The game is played from a first-person perspective. The player controls one of the Martyrs condemned to Hell, tasked with meeting the Red Goddess, one of the creators of Hell, in an effort to escape and return to the land of the living. Unlike other Martyrs, the player possesses the unique ability to possess both other Martyrs and, later in the game, lesser and higher demons, giving them access to special abilities. Using mechanics such as crouching and holding their breath, the player can avoid demons. Besides hiding, the player needs to solve puzzles in order to unlock new areas. There are available hidden statues that the player can collect, as well as paintings which are possible to discover.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XRIGfwxLYk/sddefault.jpg,0.0212732458030815,0.001458341242917665,14.587289433384381,0.003288526003363341,0.022731587045999164,0.026020113049362505,2018-05-31,16:44:28,Thursday,3,10,58,10,46,53,457,4,79,0,0,9,0,3,1,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.712316279984457,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ZESi9TCPRE/sddefault.jpg,0.01716711849756404,9.167583425009168e-05,187.25892857142856,0.0002946723243752947,0.017258794331814133,0.017553466656189433,2018-01-12,09:35:00,Friday,4,10,38,10,33,55,334,1,79,0,1,7,14,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.288180225452861,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

1) Millie Bobby Brown to Play Sherlock Holmes‚Äô Sister Enola Holmes in New Movie

2) Disney admits to darkening extras' skin for the live-action Aladdin

3) Todd McFarlane Shares an Update on His ‚ÄòSpawn‚Äô Movie, Which He Compares to ‚ÄòJaws‚Äô

4) Pinhead Is Back in the First ‚ÄòHellraiser: Judgment‚Äô Trailer

5) New trailer released for Blockers starring John Cena 

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

Deadline reports that Legendary Entertainment has made a deal with Stranger Things‚Äô Millie Bobby Brown to star in and produce a feature film based on the novel series Enola Holmes Mysteries by Nancy Springer. The book series began in 2006 and spans six novels revolving around mysteries investigated by Sherlock Holmes‚Äô much younger sister, Enola.

Coming from a report in The Sunday Times, hat tip to Indie Wire, Disney has admitted to using makeup to help dozens of white extras look Middle Eastern for crowd scenes while shooting the upcoming, live-action remake of Aladdin. According to the British newspaper: ‚ÄúThe company says it resorted to darkening white people for roles requiring skills that could not be readily found in the Asian community‚Äù near Longcross Film Studios, where shooting is underway, ‚Äúsuch as stunt men, dancers and camel handlers.‚Äù 

AGREE/DISAGREE

Spawn creator Todd McFarlane recently spoke to AZ Central (via The Playlist) for Arizona‚Äôs upcoming Ace Comic-Con when the conversation turned to his Spawn movie reboot set up at Blumhouse. McFarlane said that they have just signed off on the script and are currently budgeting the movie as a dark and heavy, serious, R-rated film. McFarlane then revealed that the movie he is looking to make is more comparable with Jaws.

Bloody Disgusting debuted the first trailer for Lionsgate‚Äôs Hellraiser: Judgment; the latest installment in the iconic long-running horror franchise, which brings back Pinhead now played by Paul T. Taylor. The movie follows three detectives on the hunt for a serial killer who follow the clues right down to a hellish maze of horrors. 

Universal Pictures has released a new Blockers trailer for the upcoming comedy. The film revolves around a trio of parents played by Leslie Mann, John Cena, and Ike Barinholtz‚Äîwho discover their children have a pact to lose their virginity on prom night. Instead of letting it go, they do everything in their power to ensure their kids get ‚Äúblocked‚Äù on prom night.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdaXHQlix4lkM6j5JvoWKVRJjm4KywKSZ

Brum is the story of a very small, very smart car, who ventures out in search of all manner of adventures. Brum loves making friends and hates to see anyone unhappy. Outgoing and personable, Brum is joined by his close friends, Eep the monkey, and Bokbok and Doodle the chickens, as he explores the world. Brum is a sensitive friend, feeling things deeply and with a strong sense of empathy. Brum & Friends is a great show that teaches kids‚Äô simple lessons about compassion and friendship, with a lot of slapstick comedy in between.

Children find Brum relatable because he doesn‚Äôt always pick up on complex ideas and gets confused and frightened easily. Brum always stands up for his friends, even when he‚Äôs scared. Brum shows true bravery when someone else is in need. Brum was originally a classic live action children‚Äôs show popular in the UK in the early 1990s. Since then, WildBrain has reinvented the show for digital platforms, to produce a colorful, accessible cartoon that children globally will enjoy.


Meet the characters!

Brum
He is a sweet and happy little car who loves making friends and hates to see anyone unhappy. 
He is outgoing and personable. He feels things deeply, and has a strong sense of empathy! 
He doesn‚Äôt always pick up on complex ideas and gets confused and frightened easily. 
He rarely gets angry and is far more likely to flee than fight. 
The exception to this is if he feels that someone else is in danger.
Brum always stands up for his friends, even when he‚Äôs scared. 
He shows his true bravery when someone else is in need.

BockBock
BockBock is a total diva. Her popularity is very important to her. She does not like to be disrespected
and has a thin skin towards perceived injustices.  She‚Äôs a natural leader and tends to act as the
‚Äúmother‚Äù of the group. She does not particularly like to be touched, or to show physical affection. She
has little patience, and often finds herself exasperated with her little brother, Doodle.

Doodle
Chickens are not the smartest species in general, but Doodle is a special kind of stupid. He rarely
understands even the most simple of concepts, and has next to no impulse control, but he makes up
for it with his sweet and charming personality. Doodle is a gentle soul and becomes upset at even the
idea of anyone being hurt. He looks up to his big sister, BockBock and wants to be just like her. He
has a tendency to imitate her, which drives her crazy.

Captain Hoot
Captain Hoot is driven by one thing and one thing only: treasure. An avid collector of rare items and
anything golden, nothing matches his obsession with finding the world‚Äôs rarities. Because of this, he
might be lacking in common sense. He is large, boisterous, and craves the spotlight. His is a morality
tale: greed gets you nowhere.

Eep
A mischievous, brilliant, explorative monkey who knows how to get out of trouble as easily as she
knows how to get into it. An inventor type, it is often her inventions going awry that cause problems.
She's brimming with confidence and often comes off as self important. She can sometimes be found in
her garage, tinkering away. Always eager to show off her genius, she tends to make Brum the subject
of her various experiments. Though she is fairly young, she tends to act much older than her age with
a cynicism that comes from being a genius ahead of her time.

Wesley 
When you think of ‚Äòup to no good‚Äô think Wesley. With his band of snakes, Wesley does whatever it
takes to get what he wants

Commander Blorp
The sweet hearted Blorp uses his space age technology to help Brum and the gang however he can!

Shadow
A rough and tough mean spirited car that doesn‚Äôt take too kindly to Brum and pals

Hedgehog
Little Hedgehog is the sweet little guy who shows everyone size doesn‚Äôt matter!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7_HRtznHFSs/sddefault.jpg,0.003084620494825413,0.001376162802448063,2.2414648102231545,0.0,0.004460783297273476,0.004460783297273476,2018-03-10,16:30:00,Saturday,5,16,67,12,56,87,541,4,92,3,0,8,8,1,6,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.555242212191335,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'frisbee': 1},1

Worried about black holes? Consider this: Every time you accelerate - you generate an event horizon behind you. The more you accelerate away from it the closer it gets. Don‚Äôt worry, it can never catch up to you, but the Unruh radiation it generates sure can.

Previous Episode:
The Andromeda-Milky Way Collision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P1xKh_kZFU

Around the same time that Stephen Hawking was demonstrating the existence of the black hole radiation that would bear his name, three other researchers, Stephen Fulling, Paul Davis, and William Unruh, were looking at an effect that now seems eerily similar. They were independently studying how the nature of quantum fields appears to change depending on whether or not an observer is accelerating. They found that simple act of acceleration cuts off your causal access to a region of the universe. It creates a type of event horizon. As we saw in our episode on horizon radiation, the presence of horizons distorts the quantum vacuum in a way that can create particles.

Make it worth the risk you're taking
'Cause mother's not right here, oh yeah
Just keep on grinding on my body

Every time I go into the store I see people do the MOST with the testers and I would never even touch them tbh. I was actually shocked at my pink eye invulnerability while filming this video LOL but seriously I took as many precautions as I could and was cleaning using the alcohol to sterilize each product.  I don't recommend using the eye products, but hey ANYTHING 4 VIEWS!

They owe responses to Senators and Representatives on at least 44 questions.

Many Facebook users who watched the testimony still have questions, too. In Denver, Pollster Frank Luntz talked a group of 21-to-49-year-olds, who both despise the platform‚Äôs tactics but at the same time, can‚Äôt live without it.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing else like it,‚Äù said 26 year-old Erin Finn. ‚ÄúBut if you delete it what is there to replace it? How am I going to connect to my family?‚Äù  She added, ‚ÄúYou can meet ‚Äî or you can reconnect with someone that you went to school with ten years ago.‚Äù

None of the panelists trust Co-Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and felt like his answers on Capitol Hill rang hollow and felt insincere. 

‚ÄúYou can't have that much power unregulated in the hands of one CEO,‚Äù said Andrew Bunker, a 23 year-old legislative assistant. ‚ÄúHe has, for my mind, little risk of losing his position because the unwillingness of us to change our social-media behavior.‚Äù

And while most were concerned about how Facebook might be using ‚Äî or potentially abusing - their personal data, they were even more concerned about the long term impacts on democracy.

‚ÄúI would ask him if he could stop making these mini propaganda machines,‚Äù said Jamie Javier, a 39 year old geotechnical engineer from Boulder, CO. ‚ÄúI think that is divisive and ‚Äî yeah, just in general, bad for society.‚Äù

Sophia's creators from Hanson Robotics say they didn't expect it to take off as much as it did. But now, it's raising questions about just how much thought goes into the potential negative consequences of developing AI.

The animatronic robot has made its way across late night stages, graced the cover of magazines, headlined major tech conferences and even delivered a speech to the United Nations.

Sophia been touted as the future of AI, but it may be more of a social experiment masquerading as a PR stunt.

To understand Sophia, it's important to understand its creator, David Hanson. He's the founder and CEO of Hanson Robotics, but he hasn't always been a major figure in the AI world.

Hanson actually got a BFA in film. He worked for Walt Disney as an ""Imagineer,"" creating sculptures and robotic technologies for theme parks and then getting his Ph.D. in aesthetic studies. Back in 2005, he co-wrote a research paper that laid out his vision for the future of robotics.

And the thesis sounds a lot like what's going on with Sophia The Robot now.

This clock isn't telling time. Instead, it tracks the location of your friends and family. The hand represents a person in your circle. The ""hours"" represent the location and status of the person. 

The clock can supposedly track a person's location and whether they are currently in transit. How does it all work? People in your circle have to download an app and add their most visited locations like work and school. The app shares their location and status to the clock. For those that are worried about their privacy, the creators claim data is constantly wiped from their servers.  

Each user can also choose which locations they want to share. The creators expect to sell the clock for $500.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (‚ÄúThe Client List,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost Whisperer‚Äù). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (‚ÄúNotorious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeroes Reborn‚Äù) are featured in series regular roles.

Regardless, I was able to tie the sound kit into the lighting ""card"" that already comes with the unit. I hope that some of you doing this along with me, will find this information helpful!  I do run into a few snags a long the way, and I am still waiting for the ""proper"" speaker to come in the mail.. but its literally on a slow boat from China!

In the meantime I will use a dual speaker setup I have .. and see if this Cross RC Sound Kit grows on me.  To be honest, I think Cross RC missed the mark on the sound for a Pickup truck like this.. and I found the sound to be a little disappointing. Is it becuase of the speaker setup? Very possible.. so I will wait and see. If I am still not satisfied at that time, then I will be installing the ESSONE, dual speaker replacement. 

The model of truck I am using is a ""Cross RC PG4L"". I purchased it at ""Action Hobby"", in Calgary Alberta, Canada.

In this video I show a day in the life and full day of eating at uni for fat loss.

In this series,  I will be recording my journey on the trim down train (choo choo) with a few videos per week showing what I eat, my workouts and how I train (gym and home workouts), recipes and everything involved in my cut. Let's get shreddy for summer!

Hey my lovelies! In today's video I thought I would do something a little bit different.. I decided to turn into Kylie Jenner for a week. I thought this would be quite interesting as we have such different lifestyles, fashion senses and general looks. It was really fun to have a different look for a whole week and experience new things I wouldn't usually think to do. I also loved trying to recreate Kylie's looks on a budget! Let me know if you'd like to see more videos like this!

Miss Mulatto spoke to VladTV about turning down a deal with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def label after winning ""The Rap Game,"" which she says came as a shock to some people. However, Miss Mulatto explained that she never spoke face-to-face with Jermaine Dupri about the deal, adding that their lawyers were the only ones involved in the conversation.¬†

During the sit-down, Miss Mulatto also spoke about riding the independent¬†wave, investing money from the show, and getting offers from other labels.

Videos explaining things. Mostly over topics like history, geography, economics and science. 

We believe that the world is a wonderfully fascinating place, and you can find wonder anywhere you look. That is what our videos attempt to convey. 

Currently, I try my best to release one video every week. Bear with me :)

Save a TON of money by not buying an off the shelf Murphy bed kit for almost $300 and make your own with these simple boat seat swivel bearings.

The wall bed is made from 3/4"" red oak PureBond plywood and the design is my own, which you can find plans for below, but is similar to other designs you will see. In total you will need 5 sheets of plywood to complete the bed. I skipped over the shelf build in the video as I would like to make a dedicated video for that later but you will need QTY 3 3/4"" sheets and QTY 2 1/4"" sheets of plywood to make the additional shelves on either side of the bed.

Crystal Liu Yifei is a Chinese actress and singer with a background in martial arts, so in my eyes, she is perfect for Mulan. The new remake is set to be in theatres next year in 2020 and I can‚Äôt wait. Unfortunately it won‚Äôt be a musical, but perhaps it is for the better since suddenly having the characters sing might be out of place with the overall tone of the movie. I hope at least a song or two makes it into the movie in a way that merges seamlessly with the tone of the film (such as Lavender‚Äôs Blue in Disney‚Äôs 2015 Cinderella). 

Anyway, onto the costume design for Crystal Liu as Disney's Mulan. In my mind, this is the costume design for Mulan after she has been revealed as a girl. However, this does not mean she must be in her girly pretty princess outfit. I still wanted her female side to be shown in her 'manly' outfit. I made certain decisions based on this including having her hair half up so her iconic bun is still there, but balanced with her loose hair. 

For the majority of the costume, design details are based on the original cartoon version. For example, the green and brown earth tones are consistent with the cartoon, and same with her bun hairstyle and hair ribbon/tie. There is one little detail which I thought was a nice touch, and that is the dragon detailing on her shoulder. I thought it would make a cute idea to have it represent Mushu and therefore she will always have Mushu by her side, even when Mushu is not there. 

Thank you if you read this far. Let me know that you read this far by commenting my favourite Mushu quote: ‚ÄúI'm not tiny, I'm travel sized for your convenience‚Äù! ;)

Bazzi - Mine Lyrics (you so precious when you smile) ‚úçÔ∏èüé§
Huh, yeah, naw I just, had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel, look

You so f-ckin' precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine

Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

I'm so f-cking happy you're alive
Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

Before the sun never set on the British Empire; before Genghis Khan swept the steppe; before Rome extended its influence to encircle the Mediterranean Sea; there was ancient Assyria. Considered by historians to be the first true empire, Assyria‚Äôs innovations laid the groundwork for every superpower that has followed. Marian H Feldman details the rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire.

Our supplier of goods of questionable legality has delivered again; we've gone from doing simple parkour to ninjutsu in just one week.
Unfortunately for us, it was the rainiest day Los Angeles had ever seen; leaving us with little to wage irregular warfare on besides the old Christmas tree.

The following is for those multicultural:

Esimene spetsiaalne ninja v√§lja√µpe algas 15. sajandi keskpaigas, mil teatud samurai perekonnad hakkasid keskenduma salajasele s√µjapidamisele,
sealhulgas spionaa≈æi ja m√µrvamist. Nagu samurai, s√ºndisid ninjad elukutsesse, kus hoiti traditsioone,
ja l√§ks pere l√§bi. Ninjad √µpetati lapsep√µlvest, nagu see oli ka levinud samurai perekondades. V√§ljaspool oodatud v√µitluskunstide erialasid
noored uurisid elluj√§√§mise ja uurimise tehnikaid, samuti teavet m√ºrgiste ja l√µhkeainete kohta.

The game also introduces all-new ways to play, including Joy-Con‚Ñ¢ controller enabled minigames, and new modes to enjoy with family and friends. Board game play goes back to the four-player basics as you take turns and race across the board searching for Stars. You can also pair up two Nintendo Switch systems and delight in this dynamic play style, such as in the new Toad‚Äôs Rec Room mode. With new modes and new minigames coupled with original board game play, the party starts anywhere, anytime, and with all kinds of players. Super Mario Party is available October 5th!

There is a somewhat deeper meaning/inspiration behind this project regarding the mini dominoes vs. the normal sized dominoes. See if you can analyze this project from an artistic point of view, and let me know what you think in the comments ;) The thought process for this project explaining everything will be posted next week!

Let's face it, every performer has a bad show here and there. Whether we're talking technical malfunctions, sudden illness, or just plain choking under pressure, there are a myriad [MEER-ee-add] of ways things can go wrong in front of a live audience. But for the stars on this list, things didn't just go wrong, they went completely off the rails. These are the live performances that destroyed these artists' careers...

To watch me build my next cabin - bigger and better than this one!..
To relax‚Ä¶
To virtually immerse yourself in nature‚Ä¶
To see how I live debt free, stress free and low cost‚Ä¶
To see how I build things alone‚Ä¶
To see how I cook with no electricity or gas‚Ä¶ 
To hear what steps I took to retire in my mid-forties so I could live my dream life‚Ä¶
To interact with the happiest and most helpful community of viewers on YouTube‚Ä¶
To become more self-reliant.
Finally, one video showing the entire build process from the cutting of the first tree to the laying of the last floor board - no food, no talking, no visitors, just carpentry, bushcraft, timber framing, blood, sweat and tears. 
My end goal is to have an off grid, primitive wilderness homestead, where I can practice primitive technology, bushcraft and traditional skills in an effort to become as completely self reliant as possible in this day and age.
In late April, I cut the first balsam fir tree down on the property near Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. Next, from June until August, I collected all of the building materials and fabricated the cabin using saddle notches in the corners. I cleared the land in August, laid down gravel for a pad and began erecting the off grid log cabin. By September, the walls were done and I started on the roof framing in October. 
In November, I burned the roof boards with shou sugi ban, an ancient Japanese technique for preserving wood. Against convention, I installed the roof in board and batten fashion, using my roofing background to come up with techniques to keep the cabin watertight. 
Next, I moved inside where I installed a Vermont Castings wood stove on top of a limestone flagstone floor, which extended from the doorway to the center of the cabin underneath the fireplace. 
For the rest of the floor, I framed it using 2x4 and 2x6 red pine boards and then installed 2x6x10' boards, which I burned using the same shou sugi ban technique.
Now in December, I chinked the walls with moss and clay and have been spending a lot of time in the cabin, starting rustic furniture made with materials from the surrounding forest.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7uHUIhI2eXI/sddefault.jpg,0.007929523637754484,0.00011194621606241624,70.83333333333333,0.0002674270717046609,0.0080414698538169,0.00830889692552156,2017-12-07,09:35:00,Thursday,3,8,38,8,33,51,334,2,79,0,1,7,14,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.386515322727431,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 2}",3

The secret is simple: good-quality environmentally-friendly oats help you feel and look better on the inside and out.
Oats have some unique properties thanks to the wide variety of vitamins and minerals they contain.  Zinc helps cleanse the skin and remove toxins and other harmful compounds. Iron is one of the most important elements for the nutrition and saturation of moisture in skin cells. Magnesium promotes blood circulation and noticeable skin cell renewal.
While protein is extremely important, your body also demands carbohydrates and fats, both of which you can find in oatmeal. Oats are also rich in antioxidants that help alleviate itching, inflammation, and high blood pressure.
The slow carbohydrates found in oatmeal help curb your appetite and maintain normal blood sugar levels. All those nutrients in oats not only boost your metabolism but also prevent the accumulation of fat and toxins in the body. Thanks to the antioxidants present in oatmeal, the probability of damage to the walls of blood vessels by free radicals is reduced significantly.
If you find it boring to just have oatmeal for breakfast every day, you‚Äôll love the recipes we have put together to help you turn a boring oatmeal breakfast into something way more flavorful.

SUMMARY
-Oatmeal is ideal for treating inflammatory conditions, like eczema, dermatitis, and skin rashes. It also promotes healthy skin overall.
-One serving, or about half a cup, of oatmeal gives your body 15% of the recommended daily amount of protein. Don‚Äôt forget about vitamin E, antioxidants, and glutamine, which help muscle fibers regenerate faster.
-Oats are rich in antioxidants that help alleviate itching, inflammation, and high blood pressure.
-Oatmeal is full of carbohydrates that give your body the energy it needs.
-Beta-glucan in oats keeps you from overeating by helping you feel fuller for a longer amount of time and promoting the release of a satiety hormone.
-The linoleic acid and soluble fiber contained in oatmeal helps lower the level of bad cholesterol in the blood.
-Oats are rich in good healthy fats and support the cells in the heart and circulatory system.
-Experts recommend getting at least 25-38 grams of dietary fiber every day since it‚Äôs ideal for good digestion.
-Try apple pie oatmeal to boost your metabolism. You‚Äôll need oatmeal, almond milk, cinnamon, maple syrup, a large apple and apple sauce to cook it. 
-The ingredients you‚Äôll need for oatmeal raisin cookies are flour, sea salt, baking soda, butter, an egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, apple sauce and fast-cooking oats.  
-To cook almond butter-banana oatmeal, you‚Äôll need oatmeal, milk, almond butter, honey and a banana.

Margaret Atwood's speculative fiction masterpiece ""A Handmaid's Tale"" explores the consequences of complacency and how power can be wielded unfairly. Atwood‚Äôs chilling vision of a dystopian regime has captured readers' imaginations since its publication in 1985. How does this book maintain such staying power? Naomi R. Mercer investigates.

Security is always a concern as our products ship, especially in today's world of cracking attempts. But, what enables the crackers to be able to break into systems? Oftentimes, the answer is that they reverse engineer your product. In this tutorial, we will examine the techniques used by the cracker to reverse engineer your hardware and your software. We will look at techniques to bypass physical security as well as repopulating connectors on motherboards, reading flash storage, accessing firmware updates and the software techniques used to find vulnerabilities in your code.

Song - World In My Eyes
Artist - Depeche Mode (Cicada Mix)

Lyrics (so you can sing along):

Let me take you on a trip
Around the world and back
And you won't have to move
You just sit still

Now let your mind do the walking
And let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes

I'll take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
And we won't need a map
Believe me

Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes

That's all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
That's all there is

Let me put you on a ship
On a long, long trip
Your lips close to my lips

All the islands in the ocean
All the heaven's in motion
Let me show you the world in my eyes

That's all there is
Nothing more than you can touch now
That's all there is

Let me show you the world in my eyes

We take any opportunity we can to personalize our beauty regimen‚Ä¶ custom perfume, custom clothes, custom lipstick - you name it!! But custom SKINCARE?!? This is too good to be true. 

This week on Beauty Trippin, Lily & Joslyn are visiting the Kiehl‚Äôs Apothecary. Instead of brewing potions, we learn how to make a magical skin serum that is COMPLETELY personalized for our skin type and problem areas! #SCIENCE! 

Before we get to mixing though, we need a skin assessment to see what those problems are and what health issues are secretly hiding under the surface‚Ä¶ and it ain‚Äôt pretty. 

What custom beauty product should we make next?? Comment & tell us!

MAIN TOPICS
PATREON SUPPORTER John DiNicola - Have you noticed The Equalizer 2 starring Denzel Washington is set for release on July 20th, and yet there‚Äôs been no official poster, trailer, images, or anything released? Isn‚Äôt that a bit strange? That‚Äôs over 3 months away... and yet, nothing. Thoughts?

CC & More - Playing devil's advocate here for a debate. I watch your show every day and I'm not sure if you've actually discussed this, but what if Infinity War sucked? What are the potential consequences for the MCU if that actually happens? I of course have utmost faith that this film will be awesome (even as a DC fan) and that I will love it, but... what if? Thanks and keep it filthy!

PATREON SUPPORTER Blake Carson - Yesterday you talked about the new writer for the Batgirl movie, and also yesterday Jake Gyllenhaal gave an emphatic ‚Äúno‚Äù to if he will star in The Batman movies. So that I wouldn‚Äôt be peddling false news, I watched the source video and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any room for misinterpretation.

lyrics:

amanda: 
your seven hundredth bedroom 
the waiter brings the bill 
you came here dressed for battle 
you knew damn well. 

the sharpening of axes 
the fat man rings a bell‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: 
don‚Äôt touch me 
i‚Äôm not here to help 

amanda 
he‚Äôll smother what he captures‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: move over 

amanda: 
you know damn well. 

every door behind you closing‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: 
you‚Äôre a very lucky girl‚Ä¶ 

amanda: 
every velvet rope that opens‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: 
every time the robe unfurls. 

amanda: 
you came here with a wish-list‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: move over 

amanda: 
you came with bows and bells‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: i‚Äôm not here to have 

amanda: 
you came here armed for action‚Ä¶ 
you knew the drill. 

jasmine: 
move over before i shelve myself 
i‚Äôm not here to help you. 

amanda: 
every man behind the curtain 

jasmine: 
jerking knobs and smoking guns 

amanda & jasmine: 
shut your eyes pay no attention 
just keep calm and carry on 

black or blue, you choose 
you‚Äôre free to be inbetween 
play or lose 
you say 
it‚Äôs not what you meant to mean 
black or blue 
you mean 
what? you‚Äôve got to be kidding. 
just turn me over 

jasmine: 
fast 
and 
let‚Äôs get this over with 
let‚Äôs get this over with 

amanda: 
let‚Äôs get this over with 

jasmine: 
let‚Äôs get this over with. 

amanda: 
you crouch down in the bathroom‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: our time is at a loss 

amanda: 
the mirror makes you sick‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: 
won‚Äôt have you in me 

amanda: 
you hear him channel surfing‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: 
won‚Äôt have you near me‚Ä¶not at any cost 

amanda: 
you knew this script. 

jasmine: 
run now, girl, run. 

amanda: your shirt is on the table‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: run now girl, toss back the covers‚Ä¶lay your buttons on the ground 

amanda: your skirt is on the floor‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: i dare you not to lay back down, your fetish on the floor 

amanda: you did what anybody would‚Ä¶ 

jasmine: bless me with the strategy to chip away your smell 
walk 
the nightmare out the door 

amanda: 
every version has two endings 

jasmine: 
every night the penny drops 

amanda & jasmine: 
open casket, open casting 
this is where the story stops 

jasmine: 
i storm out through the hallway 
i leave the scars inside 
you won‚Äôt portray my picture 
this film is mine 

amanda: 
every door that closes opens 

jasmine: 
you may cut this lucky girl 

amanda 
say you‚Äôve got 
a lot of nerve 
walking in here on your own 
so come and get it 
you deserve it 
everybody wants to rule the world 

jasmine: 
say you want me 
say you‚Äôll haunt me 
say you‚Äôre angry 
say you‚Äôre honest 
say you‚Äôre honest 
say you‚Äôre sorry 
say you‚Äôre sorry 

amanda & jasmine: 
black or blue 
you choose 
you‚Äôre free to be inbetween 
play or lose 
you say 
it‚Äôs still not what you meant to mean 
black or blue 
you mean 
what? 
you can‚Äôt be serious 
don‚Äôt you dare forget 

jasmine: 
that i‚Äôm the one writing this 
i‚Äôm the one writing this 

amanda: 
and this never happened. 

jasmine: i‚Äôm the one writing this. 

amanda: 
this never happened. 

jasmine 
i‚Äôm the one writing this.

Why do we love people we're related to? Compared to strangers, why do we feel such a deep sense of connection with our family members? Sure, they're nice to us, we take care of each other, and we often live with them, but there has to be a deeper biological reason. That reason, unsurprisingly is evolution. In this video, I explain why taking care of our family, or even dying for them, makes sense in the eyes of evolution.

Silveria says he's ""disgusted"" by the sexual assault reports, but he also says ""I don't think there problems"" with sexual assault at the academy and how it handles the cases.

There is a letter to u down here plz! -edit- the last lyrics don't mean leave LIFE lol I am not suicidal

SO this past year has been a time of RELEASING music. Producing the songs I've written and put out on this channel, writing for production and playing with a band on tour.
Trouble IS now I feel like everything I put on this channel must be for production
which sends me into a SPiRAL of ""it's not good enough to be recorded! once I upload it that's IT it's finished and cannot be changed! I can't set this in stone!`"" etc

hence why no uploads, creative crisis, etc. But I think what I'm going to do iiiiis
ignore that lol. And just upload anyway.
BUT, to my audience - plz bare in mind that these are like... first drafts of songs. When I go to produce them we might change stuff around, add new sections, etc. And for that I am sorry!

I fly to LA for the WHOLE of january. I'll be writing and collabing my heart out!
I'm so sorry for the hiatus. This year has been a LOT
love u! truly! thank you for EVERYTHING. And your words and love DO help me. I'm working on believing them. xxx

LYRICS

he was certain
so was I
there was comfort
in her sighs
dreams and ideas should not be the same thing
You waited smiling for this

oh she‚Äôd want it
if she knew
she could take it,
I thought too
be careful be cautious but you just wished harder
you waited smiling for this

-chorus-
‚ÄúBut they love you!‚Äù over and over ‚Äúthey love you!‚Äù
thousands and thousands of
eyes just like mine
aching to find
who they are
and they love you! oh you can feel how they love you!
coated and warm but that‚Äôs
all they can do
words only get through
if they‚Äôre sharp

Oh how fitting
for one so fake
make me a fairy
whatever it takes
and just like her tale my dream was a scam
Oh you waited smiling for this

I am burnt out
I smell of smoke
it seeps through her cracks and so I start to choke
sentences sit in her mouth that are templated
You waited smiling for this

-chorus-

I can just talk about it
maybe I'll talk about it
i'll never talk about it
i cannot talk about it

don't build hope on something broken
i am not cartoon
cry for help
i am not joking
i might just leave soon.


if u like my writing - i wrote a book! http://secretsforthemadbook.com/

We will have to play two almost perfect matches to qualify.""

It will be a special duel for the midfielder, who will return to the stadium where, in the 92nd minute of Barcelona‚Äôs semi-final against Chelsea on May 6, 2009, he scored to ensure Bar√ßa‚Äôs passage to that year‚Äôs Champions League final. ""It was a golazo and fate wanted the ball to go in. From a personal point of view, it‚Äôs one of the best moments I‚Äôve experienced in sport,"" he remembered fondly.

The Blaugrana captain also analysed the state of form in which his team finds itself ahead of the Stamford Bridge duel: ""The team is in a good moment and we have to take advantage of it. We can‚Äôt make any concessions because we will be penalised. Each game is a story and every knockout is different.‚Äù

El pr√≥ximo reto del FC Barcelona ser√° conseguir un buen resultado en el partido de ida de los octavos de final de la Liga de Campeones. Andr√©s Iniesta lo tiene claro: ""La eliminatoria ser√° dura y exigente y nos marcar√°. Tendremos que hacer dos partidos casi perfectos para clasificarnos"".

Ser√° un duelo especial para el centrocampista barcelonista, que volver√° al escenario en el que, en el minuto 92 del 6 de mayo de 2009, dio al Bar√ßa la clasificaci√≥n para la final de la Champions. ""Fue un golazo. El destino quiso que el bal√≥n entrara. A t√≠tulo personal es uno de los mejores momentos que he vivido deportivamente"", recuerda el ""8"" barcelonista.

El capit√°n azulgrana tambi√©n ha analizado el estado de forma en que llega el equipo al duelo de Stamford Bridge: ""El equipo llega en un buen momento y lo tenemos que aprovechar. Debemos pensar en hacer dos partidos serios y no hacer concesiones, porque en la Champions penaliza mucho"". ""Cada partido es una historia y cada eliminatoria es diferente"", sentencia Andr√©s Iniesta.

We also had some great interactions with Chip and Dale where they wanted Tim to change his Mickey for President shirt to a Chip and Dale for President shirt. We also stuck around for the end of the Star Wars stage show to get a close up look at Darth Vader, storm troopers, Kylo Ren, Rey, and Chewbacca as they exited. The interactions we had this day are what make Disney one of the most magical places on earth.

According to Amobi, ""Amazon will make an unconventional acquisition in this 2018."" Following is a transcript of the video.

Sara Silverstein: What about Amazon? What does 2018 look like for Amazon?

Tuna Amobi: Amazon ‚Äî I think the future looks incredibly bright for them. We expect them to spend north of four billion or more this year in content, almost double what they've spent thus far. So when you think about Amazon, right? So they've got this core business of e-commerce, where they're the de facto leader at gaining market share not just in the US and internationally. Then you've got all these other ancillary businesses, which are driving huge subscriber growth in their prime membership. So think about video, hardware devices, all the Echo and Alexa devices.

So Amazon ‚Äî I think they really have their A game right now, where they've kind of taken a step back and started to look critically at areas where they're going to be investing even more aggressively. They're doing that already in international markets, such as India and China. So I think the playbook is somewhat similar to Netflix, where they're doing all the things ‚Äî blocking and tackling within the domestic market ‚Äî and also aggressively expand internationally, where you have markets like India having huge upside and barely even tapped by any of these companies. So that's where you're seeing international becoming more and more of a major catalyst, which I don't think is properly reflected in the share prices.

Silverstein: And is there anything that could mess it up for Bezos or could completely derail Amazon?

Amobi: Well with Amazon, you never know. As you know, investors always scratch their heads, what's going to be ‚Äî that's not next quarter or the other quarter where, you know, spending is going to get out of hand and potentially push the company into a loss situation. So I think, for them, the challenge to your question is to demonstrate a consistent track record of profitability, you know, quarter-in, quarter-out, year-in, year-out. They haven't done that yet. I think they will; they're well-positioned to do that.

Silverstein: When? When do you think they'll do that?

Amobi: I think it's probably a few years out but you know, we're very excited about this Amazon Web Services unit, right ‚Äî the cloud infrastructure business which by, you know, far and away is the fastest growing division within Amazon. We think that they could be well-positioned to spin that out as a separate business, which could unlock further value. So I think if you're Amazon, you‚Äôre in a very good position. You're growing your Prime subscriber base at a very fast clip around the world. You're investing aggressively in content and hardware devices. Your fulfillment centers are getting a lot of scale benefits. And then the Whole Foods acquisition; let's not forget about that. We think that that acquisition is going to provide additional touch points for the company to grow its other ancillary businesses.

Silverstein: It seems like there's no business that's off-limits. What's the next business do you think Amazon might get into?

Amobi: We think, according to our predictions for this year, that Amazon will make an unconventional acquisition in this 2018. And you look across the landscape, there's a variety of areas where I think the company has, what I might call, the core infrastructure to enable them, whether it's live ticketing, for example, or even pharmaceuticals distributorship, apparel, other segments or categories within retail where the company could potentially take the next level and invest aggressively and disrupt the traditional players, which is what they do best.

This is one of two clips released by the Department of Defense. Both videos show a thermal image of an unidentified flying object. The videos have been widely shared and scrutinized. A lot of people think this is the first real evidence that extraterrestrials exist, and that they've visited us here on Earth.

There's just one thing. Most people in the scientific community don't think these videos prove anything.

People have been claiming to see UFOs for decades. Countless videos purporting to show alien aircraft have been popping up since the invention of film. But this video is unique. It was released by the Department of Defense who found the video noteworthy enough to study and release.

Until 2012, the DOD says it ran a secret ""Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program."" The program was funded by $22 million dollars worth of ""black money."" These¬†are funds the Pentagon sets aside for classified programs.

Cmdr. David Fravor:¬†""Both of us, both airplanes see a disturbance in the water and a white, 40-foot-long Tic Tac-shaped object.""

This is Cmdr. David Fravor. He was one of the Navy pilots that spotted the UFO.

Cmdr. David Fravor: ""I get over to the 8 o'clock position, it's at about the 2 o'clock position, and I decide I'm gonna go see what it is and it's about 200 feet below me. And I cut across the circle and as I get about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerates to the south in about two seconds and disappears.""

All this seems pretty incredible, so why don't scientists care?

Caleb Scharf: ""I think it's very, very difficult as a scientist to look at something like this and say anything except, you know, it's intriguing. But I would need a vast amount more documentation and context to really understand what's going on here.""

Caleb Scharf is an astronomer and director of the multidisciplinary Columbia Astrobiology Center.

Caleb Scharf: ""The difficulty with this kind of problem is that you can't plan for it.""

Carolin Frueh: ""Yeah, because I think that's exactly, one cannot tell much from the video.""

That‚Äôs Carolin Frueh, she's an assistant professor at Purdue School of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Carolin Frueh: ""Yeah, I would like to know what the wind was ... was there turbulence?

What they're talking about, is the scientific method. Basically, before scientists will accept something as fact, a lot of research and testing has to be done. And it all has to take place in a controlled environment.

Caleb Scharf: ""You can't plan for it. You can't really set up a thorough, proper scientific experiment. It's all reliant on serendipitous data. And that's one of the most difficult kinds of problems to solve in science. So I'm not surprised that we don't have a good answer yet.""

Caleb Scharf: ""I suspect pilots across the decades have seen all sorts of interesting stuff out of their window. But again, jumping to saying what you're seeing could be some advanced technological spacecraft. That's a really big leap to make.""

But these videos were released by the US government. There has to be some significance ... right?

Caleb Scharf: ""I suppose there's a spirit of openness about it, if you don't know what you're looking at, then throw it out to the world and say ""Look this is what we've got. You can interpret it in a variety of different ways.""

If we're using the scientific method, hard evidence and a cacophony of data are the best metrics for explaining this phenomenon. But what if you did see it for yourself? Would you still need an experiment to explain it?

Cmdr. David Fravor: ""I believe, as do other folks that were on the flight who visually saw it, that it was not from this world.""

The Cmdr. is not alone. The videos continue to be scrutinized by a lot of people who agree this is an alien aircraft.

As for the DOD, other than releasing the video, they haven't said much. Presumably, they have access to more data from the flight, and from reports made immediately after the encounter. Releasing more info could begin to answer to scientists' questions. But ultimately, even that might not be enough. ¬†

Caleb Scharf: ""On the one hand, I could be really cynical about all of this but I think it's really wonderful that people are intrigued by phenomena that they see out in the world. That's a good thing. That's a positive thing, our curiosity is a positive thing. And to be honest, if there are strange things floating around up there, I'd like to know what they are. The difficulty with this kind of problem is that you can't plan for it.""

Let‚Äôs find out what exactly your facial features can say about you. 
Psychologist and neuroscientist Dr. Keith Welker studied the facial structure of around 1,000 World Cup soccer players and found that a player‚Äôs facial width-to-height ratio was closely connected to the number of goals he scored. The higher the number, the more competent a person is.
Your wrinkles tell the story of your life. There are certain muscles that work every time you smile, cry, frown, or raise your brows. After some time, they get used to particular emotions and ‚Äúdraw‚Äù them on your face, making them visible even when your face is resting.
There's a slight differentiation between genders when it comes to picking ‚Äúthe good side‚Äù. Women tend to turn to the camera with their left side. Researches believe that this is because the left part of our face is controlled by the right hemisphere of our brain, which is responsible for our emotions. That's why it seems way more attractive.
In 2015 a group of scientists analyzed 123 selfies taken from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site sort of like Twitter. The researchers found a fascinating connection between types of selfies and people's personalities. Selfie takers with the infamous duck face and high angle tend to be neurotic. People who are friendlier and more open to new experiences tend to use the bottom-up approach while taking selfies.
Have you ever noticed how identical twins start to look less and less alike as they get older? You can have the best genes ever, but the lifestyle you lead will still affect your appearance.

SUMMARY
-According to the research, the visually wider your face, the higher your chances of being successful are.
-British scientists have found that men with higher levels of testosterone have wider faces with broad cheekbones.
-Crow's feet and smile lines say that you're a true optimist who's pretty emotional but also just loves to laugh and have a good time. A crease on your forehead between your eyebrows suggests a completely different story.
-Engineers, mathematicians, and chemists usually pose with their right side to the camera, while art critics and psychologists prefer their left side.
-People who are friendlier and more open to new experiences tend to use the bottom-up approach while taking selfies.
-The bigger a person's nose, the more ambitious they are.
-Your bad habits are slowly being imprinted right on your face.
-Beautiful people might seem way friendlier than they really are. Those with a round face and big eyes are often seen as naive, genuine, and kind.

PUBG XBOX ONE X GAMEPLAY - MY FIRST ONLINE BATTLE ROYALE MATCH! (PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS XBOX) - In this PUBG - PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS Xbox One X Gameplay video, I play my very first online Battle Royale match of PUBG running on the Xbox One X.  With more than 24 million copies sold on PC, ‚ÄúPUBG‚Äù is a global phenomenon and is coming to Xbox One as a console launch exclusive on Dec. 12 as part of the Xbox Game Preview program. The experience you have in ‚ÄúPUBG‚Äù on Xbox One will be somewhat similar to what was shipped back in March 2017 on PC, but with a few updates!

Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87cb1JXoLho/sddefault.jpg,0.024230764888026942,0.00014893538086325524,162.69314079422384,0.0005796113377999607,0.0243797002688902,0.024959311606690158,2017-12-15,06:09:27,Friday,4,8,38,8,33,40,334,1,79,0,1,6,14,2,0,4.0,8.0,['Crna'],['Crna'],True,['crna'],1,1,4,0,0,0,0,5.615060911354271,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

While this concept watch still utilizes a fully mechanical movement to tell the time, it also contains the new ""e-Crown"" module, which is an electronic mechanism used to set the watch and to make sure the watch is always telling the correct time. 

As we mentioned when first introducing the Type 2 e-Crown Concept, it's a complex system that bears some real explanation. So, we sat down with Ressence founder Beno√Æt Mintiens and technologist Tony Fadell (founder of Nest and inventor of the iPod) to get the full story of this watch from the two men who created it.
