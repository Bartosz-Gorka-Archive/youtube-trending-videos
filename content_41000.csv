From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

Being a kid is tough. Being yourself is even harder.

Overweight, shy and introverted, Ari wants nothing more than to fit in. He develops a crush on his fellow student, Jess, and attempts to lose weight and become more outgoing in his quest to belong.

But his efforts only cause him more humiliation and pain, making him feel even lonelier and sadder. Finally, he makes a public declaration of his own self-acceptance -- and discovers his own value.

This touching coming-of-age short touches on universal themes and common experiences that have been mined before, but director Alex Murawski offers a fresh, engaging take on the genre, capturing Ari's story with beautifully precise camerawork and well-honed performances. They bring to life a well-crafted script that underplays the emotions without ever undercutting them, and the result is a film that is still sensitive and avoids melodrama.

""Ari"" immerses the viewer in the main character's inner life, truly allowing audiences to inhabit his existence and open up a wellspring of compassion. Self-acceptance and the courage to be yourself are universal themes, but Ari's final actions in the film are surprisingly thought-provoking and heartwarming -- and will have you smiling to yourself at the end.

1) ‘Wonder Woman 2’ Will be “Totally Different” Says Patty Jenkins

2) ‘Logan’ Surprises with WGA Nomination Alongside ‘Lady Bird’, ‘The Big Sick’ and More

3) Ridley Scott: ‘No reason’ Alien shouldn’t be on level as Star Wars for fans

4) Movie Ticket sales lowest in 25 years

5) ‘Game Over, Man!’ Trailer Reveals New Netflix Movie Starring the ‘Workaholics’ Dudes

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

In a new interview with ET at the Palm Springs Film Festival, Patty Jenkins got to discussing the huge success of the first Wonder Woman when talk of the sequel inevitably came up. And though Jenkins is remaining tight-lipped about the plot of the next film, she did hint that the upcoming sequel will be “totally different” than the first film.

AGREE OR DISAGREE

As we gear up for Awards Season, kicking off with this Sunday’s Golden Globes, the other guilds are now beginning to weigh in and, up first, are the nominations for the WGA, The Writer’s Guild of America. For Best Original Screenplay, the WGA nominated: The Big Sick, Get Out, I, Tonya, Lady Bird and The Shape of Water. For best adapted screenplay, the nominations are Call Me By Your Name, The Disaster Artist, Logan, Molly’s Game and Mudbound. 

In a new interview with The Toronto Sun, Ridley Scott has again, gone on record to support the Alien Franchise, promising that he is still wanting to make a follow up to the less than stellar sequel to Prometheus in Alien Covenant. And in discussing it all, Scott compared his franchise to Star Wars and Star Trek, believing that Alien should be on the same level for the fans. 

According to Box Office Mojo, via a report from Slash Film, movie ticket sales in 2017 were the lowest they’ve been since 1992 – meaning - theaters sold fewer tickets last year than in the past 25 years. The site reports that 1.239 billion movie tickets were sold between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, which is down from the 1.315 billion that were sold in 2016. 

Netflix has released the first trailer for the new original film Game Over, Man!; an action-comedy from the creators of Workaholics. Kyle Newacheck directs from a screenplay by Anders Holm, who co-stars alongside Adam Devine and Blake Anderson as three waiters who spring into action when the building they work in gets taken hostage. Game Over, Man! premieres on Netflix on March 23rd.

Should Warner Brothers release the notorious Snyder cut -- would the possibility of a Black Suited Superman and Darkseid help the quality in order for the movie to rival Marvel's The Avengers and the upcoming Infinity War?

Dr. Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people.

The Dr. Phil show provides the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television. For over a decade, Dr. McGraw has used the show's platform to make psychology accessible and understandable to the general public by addressing important personal and social issues. Using his top-rated show as a teaching tool, he takes aim at the critical issues of our time, including the ""silent epidemics"" of bullying, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, child abuse, suicide and various forms of severe mental illness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5o6SyvhLso/sddefault.jpg,0.015870775478649436,0.0008554719071453558,18.55207090506221,-1.45810790377596e-07,0.01672624738579479,0.016726101575004416,2017-11-20,17:55:08,Monday,0,9,26,9,25,51,229,2,68,1,0,8,0,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.218062511662388,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

LYRICS:
[VERSE 1: Strong G]
Se sak fè fyète n fyè ke kwè n se black
Pou libète n te kanpe gade nou pa t fè bak 
E chak jou nan vi nou gade n vle pran on lòt etap
On lòt eta, on lòt leta
1 n vle enpoze n fè sonje kiyès nou ye
2 n vle dekwoche e kase kòn ki mare n
3 santiman nou k ap gide nou 
Nou kon kote n sòti e n gon kote nou vle ale tou.

[CHORUS: J. Perry]
Bayo, Bayo Bayo
Bayo, Bayo Bayo

[VERSE 2: Strong G]
Leve kanpe  leve kanpe 
An nou  met vwa nou ansanm pou nou chante 
Fò w espere fò w espere
Yon jou kanmenm gade sa gen pou chanje 
Chak vye moman nan lavi fò w kanpe rèd
Pa okipe sa k ap di ke nou se nèg
Kanpe rèd kou bwa mitan
Prè pou fè lit lan
Depi lè w te fèt fò w konnen byen w son militan
Chak moun gen on misyon
Wi fò w gon vizyon
Se met tèt an plas pou kapab pran bon desizyon
So mwen m ap kanpe
Ou ap kanpe
Li ap kanpe 
Nou tout ap kanpe

[CHORUS: J. Perry]
Bayo, Bayo Bayo
Bayo, Bayo Bayo

[VERSE 3: Baky]
Yow m soti Ayiti, sou tè sa'm fèt
Bleu et rouge la se de sa'm fyè
Oh yeah
Siw pa dako nou zafè
Jè'n yo avè'n nap fè yo fyè de sa'n fè 
Nou ba yo limyè lè'n klere  
(Ayiti)nou pral montre se pat sal te ye 
So Chak son m, chak rimes, chak projet, chak muzik nap montre'w vrè fòs peyi'n nan chak sa'n kreye 
N’ ba yo rèv Pou lot nasyon ka ba yo glwa
(Sa'n fè) 
Ansanm nou kanpe poun ba yo dwa yo
(Sa'n fè?) 
Sak paka pale Nou ba yo vwa
Nou gon peyi poun sove sak vle bare'n nap ba yo Bwaaaa

[OUTRO: J. PERRY]
Se pa gade selman gade pou gade

A former assistant to Harvey Weinstein, who accused him of attempting to rape a colleague 19 years ago, has called for a change to UK law on gagging orders.
Zelda Perkins worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s. She left after a co-worker said he'd tried to rape her, which he denied.
Ms Perkins told BBC Newsnight she tried to expose his behaviour but was told by lawyers she ""didn't have a chance"".
She signed a non-disclosure agreement but said the process was ""immoral"".
Ms Perkins was 24 when she signed the confidentiality agreement in 1998, which prevented her from speaking to anyone about the alleged sexual assault.
She's now broken her 19 years of silence - and the terms of her non-disclosure agreement - by speaking publicly about the movie mogul's mistreatment of women.

Lyrics:
We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange
He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes
""Get a job you fu**in'  slob,"" is all he replies
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
(Hook)
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love
He said, ""don't worry about a thing, baby doll I'm the man you've been dreaming of.""
But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
And she swear, ""goddamn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door.
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
(Hook)
I've seen a rich man beg I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the downside of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon drank from the golden cup
And smoked the finest green
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start
I knew this kid named Max who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
You know it comes that way at least that's what they say when you play the game
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like to have to lose

While I definitely don't intend on making this kind of video a regular presence on the channel, in this very special instance I felt so strongly about the issue that I wanted to say something on a personal note. Thanks for all your support and for checking out this very special video from me, and as always, thanks for watching!

You've no doubt heard the story over the last week. Viner turned social media star Logan Paul uploaded an exploitative and disrespectful video. A LOT has already been said about that. Instead, I'm here today to comment on YouTube's response. A week after the video, YouTube released an open letter saying that it will take steps to address the situation, but as we all know, they sometimes OVERCORRECT in times like this. So before YouTube takes any actions that might potentially harm the creators and viewers on this platform, I have a few words that I’d like to share.

Yasmin joins Good Morning Britain alongside former butler to Prince Harry, Grant Harrold.

In this video I show you how to get even your $200, stock FDM printer printing nearly layerless, detailed, miniatures in no time. No, these aren't meant to be a replacement to resin prints - but this is a great alternative until you can afford an SLA/DLP resin printer. 

I used a Creality Ender 3 to print the minis in this video, but the profile down below works with other printers in the Creality family as well (like the Ender 2 and CR10/CR10S). 

I also share the secrets of this profile for those who don't have a Creality printer so you can make your own profiles and/or adjustments to start getting better quality minis on your FDM printers in no time.

At the end, the most important part of being a stuntperson is to emulate the actor's movements, so the audience can't differentiate the actions of the main actor and stuntperson.

The suspect, named as Akayed Ullah, 27, was wounded when a ""low-tech explosive device"" strapped to his body blew up in an underpass, officials say.
They say three other people suffered minor injuries.
A photo circulating on social media shows a man, said to be the suspect, lying on the ground with his clothes ripped and lacerations on his upper body.
Mayor De Blasio said he was believed to have acted alone. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: ""This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom.
""We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbour and that makes us an international target.""

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qG-Cp8pDiVU/sddefault.jpg,0.011247546255690598,0.00016706344234222945,67.325,0.001156914338219939,0.011414609698032829,0.012571524036252769,2018-02-23,09:35:00,Friday,4,10,46,10,41,56,424,1,97,0,1,8,22,2,0,5.0,8.0,"['uy', 'ow', 'sare', 'CORDEN', '', '\\', '', 'e', 'TOE LN', 'rer', '', 'A', '', 'rr']","['uy', 'ow', 'sare', 'CORDEN', '\\', 'e', 'TOE', 'LN', 'rer', 'A', 'rr']",True,"['uy', 'ow', 'sare', 'corden', '\\', 'e', 'toe', 'LN', 'rer', 'A', 'rr']",11,11,27,1,2,1,1,6.396183842906217,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Here're several simple exercises to do at home that will help you to increase your height.
Everybody knows that the height depends on many factors: environment, hormones, your genes, and nutrition. But if you've always believed that you must just grin and bear it, think twice. It's hard but not impossible to change your height even after 25. 
Stretched muscles receive more blood as it circulates better in the stretched limbs. What is more, oxygen moves better in the whole body. All in all, this leads to a gradual natural stretch. 
Cobra Pose has several additional benefits, such as decreasing the stiffness of the lower back, increasing flexibility, strengthening your shoulders and arms, and firming and toning the buttocks. A longer neck you can get as a result of Neck Stretch will give you some additional height. 
There have been claims that by regular practice, vibration gymnastics can even prolong your life by decades. When your heels are raised, the largest blood vessels are filled with blood due to muscle contraction. And, when the heels are dropped back down, the blood turns around and immediately starts moving toward your heart, thus reducing the strain on it. At the same time, blood gets access to all the muscles, thus, allowing them to stretch much better.
Skipping makes the whole body slimmer, and with a slimmer body, you look taller. Swimming is one of the most effective exercises to gain height. The thing is that it stretches both the body and the spine. Moreover, when a person is swimming, gravitation doesn't affect them. So, when they keep moving their muscles, this stretches the body extremely well simultaneously having a great effect on the spine while it gets longer.

SUMMARY
-Try this antigravity exercise to stretch every muscle in your body stretches when you hang.
-The Downward Dog exercise improves stretchability, which includes arms, legs, back, calves, and hamstrings. A well-stretched body is a taller body.
-Cobra Pose helps to stretch all the muscles in your chest, shoulders, and abdominals.
-Cat and Cow Stretch stretches your torso, back, and neck, what is more, it makes your spine alignment better. Also, it helps abdominal muscles get stronger, relieves back pain, and calms you down. 
-Calves Stretch will help you to lengthen your calf muscles. 
-Flexion (stretching the neck forward), and extension (stretching the neck backward) help to elongate the muscles in your neck.
-Hip Flexor Stretch will super effectively stretch your hip flexors. To make the stretch more intense, lift your arms over your head and arch your body back. 
-Lifting up to your toes is popularly known as vibration gymnastics. By regular practice, it can even prolong your life by decades.
-Skipping is a heart-pumping high-speed activity. When you skip, all the muscles and ligaments of your body stretch and contract.
-The most fruitful swimming style is the breaststroke. When you use it while swimming, you extend your legs and arms straight, so your body is pulled in the opposite directions and well-stretched. Try to swim minimum five days a week for several hours, and you'll see noticeable results.

Following is the transcript of the video:

Jessica Orwig: What if we could control our dreams?

When most of us dream, our thoughts and actions are involuntary. The dream plays out as if we were watching a movie. But not all dreams are the same. There is another kind of dreaming called lucid dreaming, which is more like playing a video game than watching a movie.

Matthew Walker: By definition lucid dreaming is simply the act of knowing that you're dreaming whilst you're dreaming.

My name is Matthew Walker. I am a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley.

Most people actually think of lucid dreaming more in the sense of actually beginning to control what you're dreaming. So, you gain volitional control and you decide what's going to happen during your dream.

Orwig: Frequent lucid dreamers claim that they can control many parts of the dream such as teleporting themselves to another location, learning to improve real-life skills, or even eating fire. It might sound far-fetched. And until recently we lacked the technology to prove if lucid dreaming was real or not. But a series of recent studies has shed light on the phenomenon.

Walker: Scientists have designed experiments and they’ve been able to demonstrate objectively that when people say that they're doing something in that dream that they actually are.

Orwig: In 2012, scientists reported results from one of the first experiments that objectively measured lucid dreams using fMRI scanners.  fMRIs measure the rate of blood flow to different areas of the brain, so they can relay information about a person's thoughts and actions simply through a series of images.


For the study, scientists first asked participants to clench their fists while they were awake. This lit up key areas of the brain on the fMRI scanner. After that, participants were asked to fall asleep and dream about clenching their fists. Sure enough — similar regions of the brain lit up in both cases.

Lucid dreaming comes naturally to some, but many of us have never experienced the sensation. However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

Walker: How can we actually become more capable of lucid dreaming? Well, it's a little bit tricky, but you can certainly try to tell yourself that you will remember that you're dreaming whilst you're dreaming before you actually fall asleep. So, try to go through a mantra chant as it were. Some people actually try to do deliberative things whilst sleeping, like turning on the lights in a room. And that helps them to become aware that they are dreaming at the moment of dreaming itself and therefore they gain lucid control.

Orwig: Those who can already control their dreams with ease say lucid dreams aren’t only for entertainment but can also be used to expand one's conscious boundaries.

On the other hand, lucid dreamers have also reported frightening accounts where they have trouble distinguishing reality from the dream. In some cases, this can be a sign of mental illness, and should be taken seriously.

But why do some people have the ability to lucid dream but not others? And what is happening in our subconscious that triggers the experience? There’s still a lot we have to learn about the causes and effects of lucid dreaming.

Walker: It seems to be only around 20 to 30% of the population are actually natural lucid dreamers. So, perhaps if it was so beneficial mother nature would have had all of us being table of lucid dreaming. And the fact that we’re not perhaps means that it's not necessarily beneficial. But we actually don’t know. Maybe those 20 to 30% of people who do lucid dream are at the forefront of hominid evolution, and they are going to be the next species of preference. We just don't know.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter Michael - Greetings from Sweden and thank you for a great show. Just listened to your first reaction to ""Black Panther"" and it really sounded like a short review to me. What would you say is the essential difference between a review and a quick reaction? It can't just be the length of it right?

PATREON Supporter Kevin - What the hell ever happened to network entertainment news shows like Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood? Many years ago, these shows would report on movies, TV shows, and music. Fast forward to today, and they are all about celebrity gossip and the personal lives of celebrities.

Jeff Steinbeck - Hey John, hope all is well. Quick question, do you think we haven't had a Solo trailer yet us because Disney already putting so much money into the movie because of all the drama behind the scenes, they are weary on how much they put into marketing? Thanks and keep up the good work.

John Spear - Big fan. Now that you’ve seen Black Panther, does your opening weekend box office prediction change at all?

FURTHER READING

“It descends, normally, between around 5pm and 7.30pm and can be at its height at six, especially when the weather is turning and the last of the daylight has burnished the sky a shade of crimson pink.
The Sunday evening feeling is ordinarily associated with work, and the idea of going back to an office after a pleasant break. But this doesn’t quite cover the complexity of what is going on: it isn’t just that we have some sort of work to do that is dragging down our mood, but that we are going back to the wrong sort of work even while we are in dire ignorance of what the right sort of work might actually be…”

It's a funny movie parody of the latest entry to the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi. 

Summary:

The Chewbacca lip reading shows us that he can tell bad dad jokes with the best of them. The Kylo Ren lip reading reveals a Kylo Ren Rey romance, and this is Star Wars so no one would be shocked if they're related somehow. For the Poe Dameron lip reading, he realizes Luke's green light saber has gone missing. Kylo Ren has some ... stomach difficulties while getting stitched up but lucky for him no one noticed. For the Luke Skywalker lip reading, he tries to teach Rey about the force and to be a true jedi, but she just can't get comfortable. The Admiral Holdo lip reading reveals she is nuts and Poe knows it! It's a Star Wars parody in the style of the famous Bad Lip Reading.

It's Star Wars The Last Jedi just like you remember!

Characters shown (and the actors who portrayed them in the film):

Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo)
Rey (Daisy Ridley)
Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)
Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)
Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac)
Finn (John Boyega)
Vice Admiral Holdo  (Laura Dern)

Be sure to watch more lip reading videos from Brand New Dubs. Also be sure to go watch all the latest Bad Lip Reading videos from their channel (as if you haven't already!), who was my inspiration in making these as that guy is hilarious and incredibly talented.

But wait there's more! Watch the other Star Wars lip reading parody by Brand New Dubs (so far just one more, but if you want more like the lip reading last jedi, please let me know!):

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qKIBnuJfhnk/sddefault.jpg,0.00998396702303021,0.0005648749269947075,17.674650698602793,0.0004318305330119221,0.01054884195002492,0.01098067248303684,2018-04-18,06:04:18,Wednesday,2,9,31,9,26,47,254,2,61,0,1,7,10,0,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.580918908606424,2,"['neutral', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 3},3

We recently went Prom dress shopping, and tried on 36 dresses before we finally picked one! Can you guess? (All dresses are from Camille La Vie.) SHOP OUR FAVORITES HERE: http://bit.ly/BBxCamilleLaVie

It's Prom season right now, and since we're seniors in high school, this will be our last one! So Bailey and I headed over to Camille La Vie, who partnered with us on this video, to try on some of their beautiful dresses, AND HAD SO MUCH FUN!!!

Who doesn't like trying on glitz and glam fashion? There were so many styles to choose from! So we decided to start by Bailey and I picking  out three dresses each that we thought  the other would love. How did you think we did?

For the second challenge, our mom picked out one dress for each of us. How did you think she did?

For the last challenge, we decided to see how many dresses we could try on in 10 minutes! Who do you think won?

By the end of the shopping trip, we ended up trying on 36 dresses in total! And, yes, we definitely found the dresses we are going to wear to Prom!!!

who will win in a fight between Rottweiler vs German Shepherd? in a real fight Rottweiler might be the winner because it is more muscular than the German Shepherd,.. and Rottweiler has stronger bite force than German Shepherd, i’m not saying that German Shepherd would be that easily be defeated because German Shepherd is also a beast when it comes in a fight! German shepherd is a large breed of dog, it also has a very strong bite force, and an intelligent dog that’s why these two breeds of dogs are usually used as a police dog because of its very strong and intelligent characteristics… so for me, either of them may win a fight against each other… what do you think? comment down below if you have anything against my theory. In this video you will see a comparison between the Rottweiler and the German Shepherd in terms of Muscularity, who has the stronger Bite Force, who is the more Aggressive, who is the more energetic, who can tolerate cold weather, who can tolerate hot weather, who is the more dog friendly, who is the easiest to groom, the easiest to train, and who is the more intelligent

Rottweiler VS German Shepherd Who would win in a Fight?

The Rottweiler /ˈrɒtwaɪlər/ is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large.The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because one of their uses was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving for herding. Rottweilers are now used as search and rescue dogs, as guide dogs for the blind, as guard dogs and police dogs.
The American Pit Bull Terrier is a companion and family dog breed. Originally bred to “bait” bulls, the breed evolved into all-around farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become “nanny dogs” because they were so gentle around children. Their tenacity, gameness, and courage make them popular competitors in the sports of weight pulling, agility, and obedience competition.

The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language (sometimes abbreviated as GSD). The breed was once known as the Alsatian in Britain and Ireland. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.

Ebz the Artist – Say It. Lyrics 

(Chorus)
I won’t stop until you
Say it say it say it
S...s...say it
Say it say it babe
I won’t stop until ya
Say it say it
S...s...say it (2x)

(Verse 1)
Do you mind if
If I stay the night
Heavy appetite
Give you all the things that you like
I know what you like
Took some time off
Just so I can set the mood right
Baby meet me when the sky falls
And the moon lights

If you want it baby
Right now is the perfect time to prove it
If you want it baby
Right now is the perfect time to...

Imma grind it up
Dip it down
Switch it round
Flip it and repeat
Know ya lovin’ what you see
Steady rocking to the beat
Oh I love the way you look when you feel
Feel inspired
Feel inspired

(Chorus)
I won’t stop until you
Say it say it say it
S...s...say it
Say it say it babe
I won’t stop until ya
Say it say it
S...s...say it (2x)

(Verse 2)
On God
I want you to tear this ass apart
Sex drive me insane then leave hickies as tire marks
Got me so impatient as if we can’t find a park
Baby let's get lost
Imma slip off my drawls

Shit I ain’t know you was feeling me
Til I made the nigga dance like Billie Jean
Anticipation in the air started killing me
So we made it up the stairs in a minute see...
It’s funny how this conversation escalated to the bedroom
He started going then I said “I’m cumming I’ll be there soon”
I threw my legs up in the air to give him plenty head room
Then I told him “slow it down baby be more careful”

Shit
I just wanna make you proud
And don’t be worried bout the neighbors if we get too loud
It’s yours...just own it
I know...you want it
Go stupid....go crazy
But not too wild I ain’t having yo babies

(Chorus)
I won’t stop until you
Say it say it say it
S...s...say it
Say it say it babe
I won’t stop until ya
Say it say it
S...s...say it (2x)

Full Lyrics:
I’m alright today, You gonna find a way to cross and you gonna get there
I’m on fire today, Ain’t no water here to calm or even put me out
I’ll find a better way, Am I crazy or the wind is gonna blow me down

I’m gonna leave it all out there to dry
I’m gonna leave it all out there
I’m gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I’m gonna leave it all out there

You seem tired today, were you up all night afraid of what the future might bring
I feel fine today, I had dreams of you in places I’ve not seen before
You get so carried away, like lovers new to bodies first to touch you here
This ain’t a getaway, you build walls around your heart to try to lock it in

I’m gonna leave it all out there to dry
I’m gonna leave it all out there
I’m gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I’m gonna leave it all out there

And upon the wind it’s carried over the cities and the plains
You got time you’re on the mend babe 
And everybody wants the same
Everybody wants the same thing

I’m gonna leave it all out there to dry
I’m gonna leave it all out there
I’m gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I’m gonna leave it all out there

But you worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qM7iLbFXQF8/sddefault.jpg,0.005698757612191236,0.00021572942574372663,26.416227608008427,0.00014435003724685606,0.005914487037934963,0.006058837075181818,2018-01-10,06:40:44,Wednesday,2,12,67,12,52,66,520,4,89,0,2,10,38,3,6,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.2460569622570326,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

help us save many more lives.

Special thanks to our friends at LoveJoy foundation for fostering Rain and for handling her adoption: http://www.LovejoyFoundation.org

Rain was scared and expressed it in a way that I have never heard in my life!  Her cry was heartbreaking, and I am so happy that Carey Linnell called Hope For Paws and asked for help.

Her ears were eaten by flies, her coat was filthy, and I can't imagine what caused her to be so fearful.

Loreta Frankonyte was able to secure her, calm her down, and I initiated the first contact while Loreta was ready to pull her away from me if needed.  Rain never did anything aggressive, she allowed me to touch her and along with Carey, we gained her trust and got her into the crate and from there to the hospital.

The next day, Loreta and I met our friend Allison Dunbar on a rescue of a dog named Monkey.  After the rescue we headed to the hospital to clean him up, and at the hospital, Allison met Rain and fell in love!

A few days later, after a short recovery and a little bit of training with the Lovejoy Foundation, Allison, Kyle and Ernie came to visit Rain again, and the way to the adoption application was short  :-)

Rain was renamed Sassy Pants Dunbar, and she just LOVES her new life!

We really need your help so we can save more lives, so if you enjoy our videos, please donate $5 and help us change the world of these animals.

Thank you so much!!!

The director was reportedly nervous about the screening but after a positive reaction and notices, the stage is set for its rollout in theatres for the rest of the world to see. The film’s synopsis reads “When the creator of a virtual reality world called the OASIS dies, he releases a video in which he challenges all OASIS users to find his Easter Egg, which will give the finder his fortune.”

Perri Nemiroff and Scott Mantz sit down for their non-spoiler review of the movie, and share their thoughts on whether the movie lives up to the book, and if it’s a return to form for Steven Spielberg; who hasn’t made a movie of this kind in a very long time. Will the movie live up to the legend that is Spielberg? Will audiences, young and old, get caught up in the nostalgia and make this a huge hit at the box office? Find out now.

The official YouTube channel of Atlantic Records artist Kodak Black. 2017 saw Kodak rack up impressive certifications including: his gold-certified album ‘Painting Pictures’, 2x platinum single “Tunnel Vision”, and his gold-certified track “Too Many Years (feat. PnB Rock)”. To round out 2017, Kodak Black was named on both Rolling Stone’s and Complex’s “Best of 2017” lists, as well as Billboard’s “21 Under 21” list. In the same year, he released ‘Project Baby 2’ with the single “Codeine Dreaming”, which reached #52 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

His 2018 mixtape ‘Heart Break Kodak (HBK)’ went on to reach #15 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Following this release, Kodak revealed his studio album ‘Dying to Live’, which debuted #1 on the Billboard 200. The album featured the hits “Testimony” and “Zeze (feat. Travis Scott & Offset)”, which earned #1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Billboard 200 charts.

He has also collaborated with major artists such as Gucci Mane and Bruno Mars on “Wake Up In The Sky” and XXXTentacion on “Roll In Peace”, both of which have also gained platinum certifications.

Previous Episode:
Should Space be Privatized?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ7d503fN-g

Soon after Einstein revealed his great general theory of relativity in 1915, physicists realized that it allowed for the possibility of catastrophic gravitational collapse. In places of extreme density like the dead core of a massive star, space and time could be dragged inwards to create a hole in the universe: a boundary in spacetime called an event horizon that could be entered, but from beyond which nothing could return. Once formed, there was nothing in theory or imagination that could bring material consumed back to the outside universe. These black holes should exist forever – only growing, never shrinking.

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

My Lovely!

Good morning (and evening),
Happy end of may. Not long before another few weeks pass by, and before we know it, half of our 2018 is over. I am barely 2 decades old, but I feel time slipping by faster and faster already? They say that time passes quicker as you age because the ratio of time versus the amount of time you have lived continually becomes a smaller fraction. This makes sense, because I swear that a day felt like I week when I was 4. But this makes me scared of what it will feel like 2 more decades from now!!

Time is something I have come to appreciate more than anything.. And in fact, I believe that 2 of the most important things somebody can give you is their attention, and their time. Money matters in our society, but also, in our society where everyone is rushing to get somewhere or do something- when somebody gives me a bit of their time, that really means a lot. And that is also why I always want to make sure you know that I really appreciate each second you spend here with me. Of all the things you have or need to do, I am blessed that you choose to take some part of your day here, reading this. Or to choose to comment, that means a lot! Thank you endlessly.

I will be back soon with a vlog of finals week ^___^  i know we are almost well into summer break. But, I vlogged it so I ought to make it! Hopefully we will still be in the mood for a school-stress vlog LOL.

Tomorrow is my big move~ to our first official apartment! I want to say again how lovely my dorm was from last year. Man I will SO miss the gorgeous view of providence. I really felt sad that last time I stood in front of the window. And then I realized- ok I can still see providence from outside, duh LOL... But being up high on the tallest floor just isn't the same. The sun is shining high above the trees where I was. It's ok! It's also ok that my future apartment's windows have zero view and it'll be a blessing if sunlight even came in directly..

But I will only be there for a couple years at most, it's nothing super permanent! But it is a ways down towards adulthood because it is our apartment that we will be paying rent for! Having this place on youtube and working with brands like this makes that possible. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I hope that with my place here and the lovely community we have, I can do my best to spread positivity, share my lessons and thoughts with you, and make you feel love and happiness.

There is a lot of love to go around, we just have to make it happen! See you soon,
Annabelle

Lyrics

“We Are...” 
Verse 1 Noah:
My life is great
I write then hit update
I turn you on
Wanna belong
So I go to the mall
And I buy it all
 
Pre-Chorus:
(All on)
Thank god it’s the weekend
(My squad)
Got time, we can waste it
(Don’t know)
So we drive to the sunset or the fire
(it’s like)
We live in a bubble pretending it’s cause we are young
 
Chorus:
(We are fucked)
These days we only follow
These days we feelin’ hollow
Get paid, the only motto
(We are fucked)
They say it all gets better
They say won’t last forever
Then someone pulls the trigger
(We are fucked)
 
Verse 2 MØ:
The fame, the fame
I want to hear my name
And I don’t care what for
I’ll change the world
Save all those trees and birds
But first I’ll grab a Starbucks then I’ll get to work
 
Pre-Chorus:
(All on)
Thank god it’s the weekend
(My squad)
Got time, we can waste it
(Don’t know)
So we drive to the sunset or the fire
(It’s like)
We live in a bubble pretending it’s cause we are young
 
Chorus:
(We are fucked)
These days we only follow
These days we feelin’ hollow
Get paid, the only motto
(We are fucked)
They say it all gets better
They say won’t last forever
Then someone pulls the trigger
(We are fucked)
 
Bridge:
We’ve got hearts in the right places but we’re still a danger to ourselves
Maybe it’s ‘cause we are young
Thank god it’s the weekend
Should we drive to the sunset or the fire?
 
Chorus:
(We are fucked)
These days we only follow
These days we feelin’ hollow
Get paid, the only motto
(We are fucked)
They say it all gets better
They say won’t last forever
Then someone pulls the trigger
(We are fucked)
We’ve got hearts in the right places but we’re still a danger to ourselves
Maybe it’s ‘cause we are young
(We are)

qQTVuRrZO8w,_7985zBEM3o,Primitive Technology: New area starting from scratch,Primitive Technology,22.0,2017-11-24 21:03:09+00:00,[],8551830.0,237770.0,2627.0,20463.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQTVuRrZO8w/default.jpg,"I bought a new property to shoot primitive technology videos on. The new area is dense tropical rainforest with a permanent creek. Starting completely from scratch, my first project was to build a simple dome hut and make a fire. First, I took some wood, Abroma mollis, for fire sticks. I knapped a small stone blade and used it to strip the fire sicks. Palm fibre was then taken for the tinder. The fire stick kit was then placed under a palm leaf to keep it out of the rain.
Next, a stone from the creek was fashioned into a simple hand axe. This was used to cut a staff that was used to clear a path to the hut location. The location for the hut was a clearing densely crowded by native raspberry. This was then cleared using the staff and a small 2.5 m circle was levelled ready for building.
Eight 2.75 m long saplings were cut using the hand axe and brought to the site. Eight holes about 25 cm deep were hammered into the ground in a circle 2.5 m in diameter and the saplings were then planted in. The tops were brought together at the top and tied with vine. A door lintel stick was lashed to the front about 75 cm off the ground giving a low door way. 
A stone flake was used to cut about 600 palm fronds. These were split and lashed horizontally to the frame creating a thatched dome. Mosquitoes are a real problem here so a fire was lit. The fire sticks from before had a hole carved in the base boards and had a notch carved to let the powder pour out. 
The spindle was twirled in the socket and smoking powder poured out producing a hot coal. This then ignited the palm fibre tinder. The fire was transferred to the hut and a small hearth was made of stones. The fire makes a big difference in the number of mosquitoes which seem unable to tolerate the smoke. The dome was completed up to the top and a small cap was made from lawyer cane and fronds to place on the top to keep rain out. When not in use the cap can be removed to let in more light like a sky light. 
Finally wood was cut for a bed. This consisted of wooden stakes hammered into the ground at the back of the hut behind the fire pit. Part of the bed frame is attached to the sapling uprights that form the dome. This works ok without the frame shaking too much due to the low attachment point of the bed. Wooden boards were then placed on this and were covered with palm fibre for bedding. Firewood is stored just inside the entrance on the left side of the door looking in. The bed sits behind the fire pit so smoke and flames deter insects or large animals reaching the occupant. Fire sticks and tools are kept just inside the right side of the entrance.
The small hut is simple to build and creates a small, dry shelter for camping and storing tools. Though it is dark, the cap can be removed in fine weather to provide a fairly well-lit workspace protected from annoying insects. This new area has good stone, clay and materials lending themselves to elaborate shelters. A permanent creek runs through it. Mosquitoes are abundant here though and will be an issue. The Cassowary, a large, horned, flightless bird lives in this forest. It’s the most dangerous bird in the world, but generally only attacks when threatened.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

PATREON Supporter KB - Considering the #MeToo movement coupled with Natalie Portman’s “all male” directors comment at Golden Globes, do you think the Academy will feel compelled to nominate a female director this year to avoid an #OscarsSoMale campaign. Is there a female director that has a shot based on these circumstances? Patty Jenkins perhaps? Should one of the five director noms be earmarked for females?
Sarah Boystadd - I was wondering if you heard that Leonardo DiCaprio has officially signed on to star in that new Quentin Tarantino movie? What do you think the chances could be that Leo jumps from this film to work with Tarantino in his upcoming Star Trek movie?
Jason Jackson - First off I love what you do, so please keep doing what you do. As for my question: a seemingly recent trend in Hollywood is to split the climactic movie in a franchise into two parts (i.e Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Avengers: Infinity Wars.) That being said what do you think the likelihood is of Star Wars Episode IX being split into two parts? Also if they did split it where might the story go if they did split it?
PATREON Supporter Isaac Beeby - Hi John. I just wanted to clarify something from you. With this years Golden Globes done and gone, I wanted to ask you, why do you think that the Golden Globes are useless and the Oscars are meaningful when they are pretty much the exact same thing? The Emmys are for television and the GG and Oscars are for movies, so what is the difference? BTW, I’m so frickin happy that “This is Me” won best original song.
Justin Anderson - Hey John! Long time viewer first time caller. My question is about the John Wick series their calling The Continental. Do you think a TV show is a good idea or do you think they should be keeping it all on the big screen?

qS7mBbXxJYA,AxWxJNHoLC8,I grew up in a cult. It was heaven -- and hell. | Lilia Tarawa | TEDxChristchurch,TEDx Talks,29.0,2017-11-16 21:47:42+00:00,"['TEDxTalks', 'English', 'Life', 'Childhood', 'Community', 'Culture', 'Love', 'Religion', 'Society']",9049883.0,243181.0,7681.0,15470.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qS7mBbXxJYA/default.jpg,"Lilia Tarawa was brought up in the Gloriavale Christian Community on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, where she was constantly surrounded by everyone she loved. But over time, she began to see the dark side of her community, and ultimately realised that she had to get out. In this raw and emotional talk, Lilia shares the reality of life in a cult, and her heart-wrenching journey to break free. 

Lilia Tarawa is a New Zealand writer, speaker, holistic health consultant and business coach. She is a member of the Māori Ngāi Tahu tribe. Lilia was born into New Zealand's infamous religious cult, Gloriavale, and fled with her eleven family members at eighteen years of age. Her extraordinary life experience compelled her to pursue a career promoting human rights, welfare and empowerment.

The multi-talented duo, Chloe x Halle, joined BUILD to discuss their roles in the new spin-off.

But this train is unlike any other before it. Instead of rolling on train wheels, it hovers on a cushion of air. In the 1970’s hovertrains were seriously being considered the solution to slow, antiquated railways, which increasingly had to compete with new superhighways and even intercity air travel. 

Without the rolling resistance of train wheels, hovertrains promised greater efficiency and much higher speeds. By feeding high pressure air through lifting pads, hovertrains float on a cushion of air much like a hovercraft. 

One of the most widely known hovertrain prototypes was called the Aerotrain. Lead engineer Jean Bertin and his team in France, designed several versions, including one that could carry 80 passengers. The i80HV was powered by a turbofan sourced from an airliner, producing over twelve thousand pounds of thrust.   At the front, a 400 horse power gas-turbine supplied high-pressure air to hover the twenty loaded train a quarter of an inch off its guideway. The British and Americans also experimented with hovertrain technology, incorporating the linear induction motor for improved efficiency. British research led to the development of the RTV-31 Tracked Hovercraft, and the American’s developed several prototypes, culminating in the development of the Urban Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle (UTACV). 

But like their counterpart the Maglev, Hovertrains failed to revolutionize rail. Hovertrains, Maglevs, or any other innovative alternative to rail has to compete with nearly a million miles of rail line already in existence. With stations and infrastructure built-out in nearly every city in the world. The limitations of conventional railways were overcome not a single innovative leap forward, but by incremental improvements. Existing rail networks were modernized with sections of track that could handle higher speeds. New signaling technologies were developed along with more advanced wheelsets. #Hovertrain #Aerotrain #TrackedHovercraft #YesterdaysFuture

■ストーリー
人々が風と共に暮らす街・フウラシティでは、1年に1度だけ開催される“風祭り”が行われていた。祭りの最終日には伝説のポケモン・ルギアが現れて、人々はそこで恵みの風をもらう約束を、昔から交わしていたという。

ポケモン初心者の女子高生、リサ。
嘘がやめられなくなってしまったホラ吹き男、カガチ。
自分に自信が持てない気弱な研究家、トリト。
ポケモンを毛嫌いする変わり者のおばあさん、ヒスイ。
森の中で一人佇む謎の少女、ラルゴ。

偶然、風祭りに参加していたサトシとピカチュウは、5人の仲間たちと出会う。それぞれが悩みを抱え、パートナーのポケモンと一歩を踏み出せない中、みんなが出会うことで、運命の歯車が動き出す……。ルギアとの約束は守られるのか？ そして幻のポケモン・ゼラオラの正体とは？

今、人とポケモン、みんなの絆が奇跡を起こす――。

Selena Gomez ‘Sangra’ en Actuación de los AMAs
Selena Gomez termina ensangrentada tras su actuación en los American Music Awards…

Selly G estrenó su cabellera rubia pero con unos rayitos de sangre…

Una de las presentaciones más esperadas de la noche fue sin lugar a duda la de Selena Gomez y no desilusionó. La exchica Disney empezó su número musical tirada en el suelo frente a un choche rodeado de neblina. 

Poco después Selly empezó a entonar su tema ‘Wolves’ desde el piso y lentamente se logró incorporar. En su entorno surgieron bailarinas vestidas de zombis que atormentaron a Selena a lo largo de su presentación.

Incluso una de ellas empujó a la cantante de 25 años bruscamente. Al parecer Selena quiso conllevar un resurgimiento de la muerte aludiendo a su reciente roce con la calaca. 

Cabe destacar que Selena se presentó tan solo portando un camisón de seda y unos tenis blancos. Sin embargo el momento más dramático llegó cuando las bailarinas la cargaron con las luces apagadas. Cuando segundos más tarde volvieron a alumbrar el escenario, pudimos verla con las rodillas ensangrentadas. Asimismo, Selena terminó con hilos de sangre en su frente. Pero no pierdan la cabeza selenators que obviamente era sangre de mentiras. 

Y lo más confuso de su performance fue su cara al final de esta. No sabemos si era parte de su actuación o si no quedó satisfecha con su desempeño. 

Ahora les llegó el turno a ustedes de opinar. ¿Les gustó la presentación de Selena Gomez en los AMAs? ¿Y qué me dicen de su gesto al final?

With a semimajor axis of 1.329 AU, perihelion of 0.99, and aphelion 1.67 AU, it will return to the earth's orbit every 1.53 years or so, until perturbations move it to a different orbit. It will have a fly of Mars on October 5-6, 2020, but not close enough to significantly change its elliptical orbit.

United by Love fue compuesta para la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de Rusia 2018, y que será lanzada en todo el mundo este viernes 18 de mayo en todas las plataformas digitales.

La canción es una fusión de 3 idiomas: inglés, español y ruso, y habla sobre la paz, el amor y la importancia de la unión entre los seres humanos  mediante un evento de gran magnitud y tan popular como lo es la Copa Mundial.

Para la creación de “United By Love”,  Oreiro contó la colaboración exclusiva de dos grandes productores discográficos: Ettore Grenci y Diego Córdoba, quienes han trabajado con artistas de la talla de Demi Lovato, Marc Anthony, Ariana Grande y Meghan Trainor, entre muchos otros.

The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is a surprising device. It features a top-tier spec list and premium build for around $600. The construction includes premium materials like ceramic, gorilla glass and aluminum. The Mi Mix 2 has a FHD+ IPS display (not OLED but nice). The more I think about it the Mi Mix 2 is a competitive device. This kind of build and spec for this price is quite impressive.

‘Bitter because you were fired’: CNN’s panel of black conservatives battle over White House diversity



“Look, Don, you raised the point about the White House giving permission, if you will, to black Republicans to attack Omarosa, how naive are the black people at the White House?” he asked. “I mean, do they think that people truly are going to believe they had no idea whatsoever that some black Republicans were being blocked? I know earlier today, the press secretary said, ‘We have diversity, we believe in diversity. We want to reflect America.’ If that’s the case, where are the black people. I mean, seriously, where are they? Outside of the groundskeeper, the butlers the maids — where are the black people? There are none.”
“Whoa, Shermichael calm down,” Dennard said. “Maybe you’re bitter because you were fired, but let me keep going.”
“Oh! Do you really want to go there tonight, Paris?” Singleton shot back. “I may have been fired but at least I have respect for my community. I’d rather have respect than be a sellout, but go ahead.”

“Watch your mouth, Shermichael,” Dennard said.

“Don’t tell me to watch my mouth,” Singleton zapped back.

Before proceeding with any other vlogs and content, there were some things I wanted to express. Whether it would be helpful to those who hear it- it was certainly therapeutic to communicate these thoughts. Snippets from all throughout this year- I realize that this isn't the most joyous, holiday-spirited content to be putting out, with Christmas tomorrow.
 I hope where ever you are, that you feel the love and hope I send you.

El grupo LSD (conformado por la reina Sia, Diplo y Labrinth) lanzaron esta nueva canción que me dejo calvo.
#LSD
#Audio


""Audio"" es una canción que parece que trata sobre pasar un buen rato y disfrutar la vida, y también nos habla de lo importante que es la música en la vida para los chicos de LSD. Pero si lo vemos desde otro punto de vista, podría tratar sobre drogas; cada quien puede interpretar la canción de manera distinta, lo importante es disfrutarla.
El origen de la canción vino cuando Sia, Diplo y Labrinth estaban en el estudio y aparentemente la caja de resonancia estaba rota, y no había audio, mientras los ingenieros la estaban arreglando, los chicos estaban cantando sobre no tener audio, después de eso nació esta canción.

*audio: el concepto de audio se emplea para nombrar a la técnica que permite grabar, transmitir y reproducir sonidos, por ejemplo: puede ser una pista de sonido o una canción.

*nos estamos drogando, tú tienes el polvo lunar: posible referencia a la cøcaína.

*haz un ritmo explosivo: aquí adapté un poco la frase al concepto de la canción, en inglés originalmente dice ""make a bomb bomb beat"" pero si lo traducimos literalmente sería como ""haz el ritmo bum bum"" JAJA así que creí que lo mejor sería modificar esta parte.

*la ""s"" en mi pecho con mi marilyn monroe: referencia a la serie original de Superman, con los difuntos George Reeves y Marilyn Monroe como protagonistas.

With so much bad news on our social media feeds, on our televisions, and in so much of our daily dialogue, it's easy to overlook all the things in this world that make us smile. In this video, my friends and I team up again to bring you all different tidbits of positive events, messages that have helped us, and just goofy vibes that you can use as a pick-me-up if you need it. Hope you all enjoy!!

Yo soy la jezzi la Barbie de tu closet
Respeten los rango, eviten el rose
Toda´ esa  cuenta ponganmela a mi 
Que yo ando con lo mio eso es así

Pero Bum Bum Bum 
Yo me porto bien cuando quiera 
Hago coro con el que quiera
A mi manera
Aprendan a amar mi loquera 
Recuerden que no soy cualquiera

Usted tranquilo que yo ando bien
Mire para mi  mesa y mi coro también
Traten de hacerlo

Si el nivel se siente de que yo piso el conten

It could be possible that one day, billions of years from now, the Earth will stand still. But chances are good that other events that will occur before that, such as the sun swallowing up the planet. With that being said, there isn’t a chance that the Earth will suddenly stop spinning anytime soon. But let’s just assume for a moment that the Earth did suddenly stop rotating, and take a look at what would happen to us, and the planet. 

Our planet spins at its equator 1000 miles per hour as it orbits the sun. But, as you get closer to the poles, the rotation is slower. Without this rotation, life as we know it wouldn’t be possible. It is said that billions of years ago, our planet used to spin much faster than it does now. In the beginning of our young solar system, an unknown planet or large celestial body collided with the Earth, and in that collision, the Earths alignment and rotation were changed, and the moon was formed. Since then the Earth’s rotation has been slowing down. It is said that the moon used to also spin faster than it does now before it became tidally locked with the Earth. 

Tidal locking is the name given to the situation when a moon or planetary object’s orbital period matches its rotational period. Coincidentally, it is the same fate that affects every single large moon orbiting a planet. A great example of this is our own Moon. 
In our early Solar System, both the Earth and the Moon rotated independently of each other. 

But the Earth’s gravity grabbed onto the tidal bulges and slowed down the rotation of the Moon. To compensate for the loss of momentum in the system, the Moon drifted away from the Earth to its current position, about 230,000 miles away.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q_T7L8rt1Ec/sddefault.jpg,0.006455562305328982,0.0005720069155378812,11.285811639634723,0.0012236129943256164,0.007027569220866862,0.00825118221519248,2017-11-26,17:09:39,Sunday,6,10,63,10,54,59,531,2,107,0,0,9,27,3,6,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.520350836239985,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Shame is the Nation of the United States for allowing an innocent man to be railroaded, rights violated, offered up as a social-political sacrifice to the US pop god of distraction and supreme oppression - of which we exist in its strongest incarnation to date. While Capitol Hill and the US Department of Defense exploited its own citizens by fabricating means to justify combat once again on the Asian continent, so we could extort Vietnam and engineer its elections - then turn around and accuse of Russia of doing the same bullshit TODAY. Everything we are suffering from today is the result of allowing Charles Manson to go on trial in 1970. When his rights were stolen from him - ours died in the process... but selflessly and honorably Charlie became the holy example of a humble martyr giving his freedom for our rights to be given back. Although a sullen thought; perhaps now... posthumously; others who couldn't get away from their fear will be inspired to right the wrongs and push the balance of Abraxas back in line from the constant onslaught of abuse by human hand.

And for what it's worth; what happened to the ol' Christian values of the good US of A... or even a memory of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Abrahamic decorum that once taught people decency at minimum??? Tell me WHO.... WHO is a monstrous beast? Who is ""evil incarnate"", the devil, a vile creature worthy of being stripped from the right to exist? Is it the man you took NO time, NO effort, NO thought of your own to make your own judgment upon him; instead of blindly accepting the definitive, most absurd, shock and gore, Hollywood depravity of a fairytale from the worst of compassionless, capitalist, elitist that humanity is capable of.... the ""HELTER-SKELTER"" insanity? National news papers saying BURN IN HELL to a the passing of a man, who had to endure having his whole life confined to the hallways of iron and concrete?!?!?! And you can look yourself in the mirror after getting your sadistic ""rocks-off"" from an indulgent fix of primal hatred in the morning paper with your Frosted Flakes? The horror of humanity's capacity to torture and abuse one another is represented in Charles Manson more than anywhere else ever... The savage brutality of the killings those young women and men were capable of physically and then spiritually when they dumped their death sentences onto Charlie, who had been nothing but kind and brotherly. Then the even worse collective cruelty - that of the average American non-thinker, and the soul crushing afflictions they can easily spit out about a man they are incapable of seeing, who is a victim of injustice, indignity, suffering, torture and had the entire country turn their backs on him... it's easy to lose everything in you that makes you a being of spirit, from witnessing that intensity of dehumanization. We can be better.... and that's why I spent the time to make this... it's not too late to get fairness and justice back to the name Manson, so take the high road and open your heart along with your mind, and both might just be changed for the better.

Don't just survive, it's not enough to simply be alive.
We must be more for our Earth, our connection to it and all living beings. We must be one. One symbiotic organism system of universal truth and soul in reverence to the Air and the Water.
We need more than just to survive... we need to be -

If we were doing an big, booming, X Factor style intro for Rita Ora being on The Official Vodafone Big Top 40, it'd sound pretty epic…
  
13 Top 10 hits, 5 No. 1 singles… only one Rita Ora!
  
With her new track 'Girls' out now (featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX), Rita dropped by for a catch-up with our Kat Shoob on how this super collab all came together.
  
Rita revealed that the track has been around for a couple of years and she'd finally decided to release it as a single. American rapper Cardi B was the first artist to feature on the song, laying down her vocals over a year-and-a-half ago.
  
Bebe Rexha was on the show a few weeks back and spilled the beans not only on 'Girls' but also a crazy night out that Rita, Bebe and Bebe's mum had in Vegas - so we had to get Rita to tell us her side of the story.
  
We also heard who Rita counts as her female role models, discovered she'd love to team up with Diplo on a tune and that her new album will definitely be out this year!
  
Plus, Kat finally got to the bottom of what the real words are in the chorus of Rita's song 'Anywhere' and whether or not you can swipe right for the singer on Tinder!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q_tkqrKp3hA/sddefault.jpg,0.01914059991007772,0.00038538120624317566,49.66666666666666,0.0010276832166484682,0.01952598111632089,0.020553664332969363,2018-05-23,15:16:22,Wednesday,2,12,44,12,25,64,276,1,40,0,1,4,37,5,0,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.3876011277838245,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Prom season is an exciting time of year, when local stores start overflowing with gorgeous gowns. But some people decided to shop online instead, and ordered dresses that looked beautiful online. But then when they got a package from China, they realized that they had had made a huge mistake. We will show you some truly impressive prom dress fails that will make you cringe. Like the epic set of Twilight prom dresses. Or the many students who decided that they just couldn’t sit through a formal event without dressing head to toe in camouflage. These are some of the worst dresses out there, and some almost defy explanation. To tell us about your own terrible prom dress experience, be sure to leave us a note in the comment section.

At long last, the first full trailer for Venom has arrived. The film, which focuses on Tom Hardy as journalist Eddie Brock, is the second big-screen appearance of every comic fan's favorite alien symbiote. After the first brief teaser of the film conveyed more about the tone of Venom than its actual content, fans finally have their first real look at what this movie will be about, and, more importantly, what Venom's iconic costume is going to look like this time around. The Venom trailer shows us glimpses of Hardy's Brock, the villainous Life Foundation, and plenty more. Amid the explosions, alien symbiote attacks, and sinister narration, there are a number of key plot points and details the trailer offers that you might've missed the first time around. Here are some of the small details you may have missed in the Venom trailer...

A lethal protector | 0:49
Voice of the people | 1:28
A dapper villain | 2:33
Love is in the air | 3:27
A complicated relationship | 3:57
One giant leap for mankind | 5:03

After the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, news networks are once again focused on the debate over gun control. These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.

The group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications. That financial allegiance means the NRA is similar to organizations like the Tobacco Institute -- an industry lobbying group primarily interested in protecting their product. 

So why do news networks keep inviting them to debate gun violence?

When you first arrive to the upside down building you must enter through the spinning vortex in order to see everything rightside up! Then we checked out all 3 floors. We rode a roller coaster simulator, an earthquake simulator and a hurricane simulator! They had lots of brain games and illusion type stuff to check out too! We even find out that Tim actually LOVES bubbles! Who knew?! We take a look at the ropes course before the school groups came in. Adam even laid on a bed of nails and lived to tell the tale! One of the coolest things was Mind Ball, a game where the players brainwaves are measured and who ever is thinking the least wins! All in all it was a pretty interesting place to spend a day!

It's PRIME TIME. AMAZON PRIME TIME. Amazon is well known for being a great service to obtain items in a quick and timely manner. With this new show not only do we put that to the test, but we venture into what Amazon is all about, the weird shit.

The rules are simple, using our collective funds we buy a few items  for each other and not knowing what they are, we share them with one another on the couch. We could very well go poor doing this, we just want you to know this.

The following is for those multicultural.

Hey guys how's it going. Has one of these ever been in English? Is that cheating? I'm not sure, but oh well. My eyes currently feel really dry, like as if you're stuck in a car with the heat all the way up and then the driver decides to throw a handful of sand into your eyes. I'm thinking about taking a milk bath and then maybe cry a little bit to moisten them right up. That should be nice, happy new years fellows!

Raph and Katie tell Ally about how they wish they were gay! Well, just for the casual sex part. Not all the suffering, and harassment, and targeted violence, and there being parts of the country that it's literally unsafe to go to. But hook-ups, yes.

Hardly Working - What really goes on in CollegeHumor offices may surprise you, unless you're already familiar with unprofessional, inappropriate slackoffs getting nothing done.

With the interior remaining a secret up until now, I have the opportunity to take a seat inside the prototype model to get a feel for what this car is really going to be like! Could you imagine anything more like a Le Mans car to drive on the road?

Named Valkyrie from Norse Mythology, where the Valkyries chose who would like and die in battle, the project between Aston Martin and Red Bull features design by Marek Reichman and engineering by Adrian Newey; between whom it seems anything is possible! Supported by a serious set of partners; Cosworth, Rimac, Bosch, Ricardo and more, the Valkyrie looks set to have circa 1,000hp and weigh just 1,000kg to reach the mythical 1:1 power to weight ratio.

With a V12 behind, a carbon teardrop shell with the thinnest of pads for seats, and bodywork that is more of a spectacle by where you don't see things than where you do, I cannot wait for the Aston Martin Valkyrie to arrive on the roads.

Thanks for watching, Tim

No thoughts
No prayers
Can't bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands
Smile for the camera
Another politician bought
I swear I heard another shot
Cash another payment
Red all on the canvas
There's murder on the campus
Another press conference
Nothing gets accomplished
The shooter's an accomplice
Money is the motive
The wars in the street
Watch history repeat

No thoughts
And no prayers
Can't bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can't bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can't bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

Bow before the violence
It's a governmental shakedown
Welcome to my breakdown
Bulletproof backpacks
They want ta arm the teachers
I think I saw the reaper
Fears good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lying to the masses
How much will it take
'Til you get buried in the coffin that you make
Heaven's sake

No thoughts
And no prayers
Can bring back whats no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

When our farther life's
Nobody make a sound
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down
Are we out of time when we turn this song around?
Are we out of time when we all
(When we all fall down)

The body count is on your hands

The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
No thoughts
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
No thoughts
The body count is on your hands.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgAxcwRFDm4/sddefault.jpg,0.012858286472977194,0.00035633395813808186,36.08493150684932,0.0005901476101218369,0.013214620431115277,0.013804768041237113,2017-11-14,09:35:00,Tuesday,1,5,38,5,33,34,334,0,79,0,1,5,14,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.400315365532789,2,"['scared', 'neutral']",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"{'chair': 1, 'tie': 1, 'cat': 1, 'person': 2}",5

""This Is America"" is a song by Childish Gambino, and was released with a music video in May 2018. The video (which shows Childish Gambino dancing in an empty warehouse, with very violent moments) immediately went viral. Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY

The song features vocals by Young Thug, Slim Jxmmi, BlocBoy JB, 21 Savage, and Quavo.

Here are the lyrics of the song’s chorus:

“This is America
Don't catch you slippin' up
Don't catch you slippin' up
Look what I'm whippin' up
This is America (woo)
Don't catch you slippin' up
Don't catch you slippin' up
Look what I'm whippin' up”

LETRA: 

Dicen que te vieron caminando sola
Pidiéndole a la luna que te de consuelo
Que por más que quieras, ya no te enamoras
Que muchos te han intentado convencer de nuevo

Pero fuiste tu, quien se marcho
Cuando más necesite tus besos
Fuiste tu quien se alejo y me dijiste
Que no había regreso
 
Pero fuiste tu, quien se marcho
Cuando más necesite tus besos
Fuiste tu quien se alejo y me dijiste
Que no había regreso

Ahora que el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que no estoy aquí, el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que no estoy aquí, el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que el amor te duele

Me dicen que te vieron caminando sola
Pidiéndole a la luna que te de consuelo
Que por más que intentas, ya no te enamoras
Por que te cuesta comenzar de nuevo

Y me vigila 24 horas
Ahora resulta que esta muerta de celos
Y ella quiere que regrese
Pero no se lo merece
 
Pero fuiste tu, quien se marcho
Cuando más necesite tus besos
Fuiste tu quien se alejo y me dijiste
Que no había regreso

Pero fuiste tu, quien se marcho
Cuando más necesite tus besos
Fuiste tu quien se alejo y me dijiste
Que no había regreso

Ahora que el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que no estoy aquí, el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que no estoy aquí, el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que el amor te duele

Ahora que el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que no estoy aquí, el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que no estoy aquí, el amor te duele, te duele, te duele
Ahora que el amor te duele
 
Gente de Zona
Para que te enteres
No lo sabías
Te quedaste sin batería
Gente de Zona
Lo mejor que suena ahora

According to a report from Variety, Warner Bros. is planning to shake things up and will be restructuring its DC films operation following the box office disappointment of Justice League. Jon Berg will exit his current job running the comic book’s film production division, with a search now underway for his replacement. Geoff Johns is expected to continue serving as DC Entertainment’s chief creative officer.

This past week, Deadline revealed that Quentin Tarantino and JJ Abrams are developing a new Star Trek movie based in part on an idea from Tarantino himself. Now Deadline again is reporting that Tarantino met for hours in a writers room with Mark L. Smith, Lindsey Beer, and Drew Pearce and its Smith, writer of The Revenant, who has emerged as the front-runner to take on scripting duties.

After a number of trailer teases and a behind the scenes video, the first trailer for Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom has finally landed online. EW recently revealed that the plot revolves around Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard returning to the remains of Jurassic World in an effort to save the dinosaurs from a second extinction after a volcanic eruption threatens the island.

BUY OR SELL

Variety is reporting that break out star from Borg/McEnroe, Sverrir Gudnason, has landed the role of Mikael Blomquist in The Girl in the Spider’s Web, Sony’s sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The part was originally played by Daniel Craig. Gudnason joins Claire Foy as Lisbeth Salander, in the movie set to be helmed by Don’t Breathe’s Fede Alvarez.

Variety is reporting that Logan director James Mangold has settled on his next project: an adaptation of Jeffrey Toobin’s best-selling novel American Heiress; with Elle Fanning is in talks to play Patty Hearst. The book to movie adaptation will tell the story of Hearst’s kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army where she later re-emerged as a member of the left-wing terrorist group.

Focus Features has released the new trailer for 7 Days in Entebbe, starring Daniel Brühl and Rosamund Pike. The movie is based on the true story of four hijackers in 1976 who took over a plane flying from Tel Aviv to Paris, and forced it to land in Entebbe, Uganda.

Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.

“Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, with Angela Bassett, with Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis.

LETRA:

Quien iba a pensar que con la misma lengua
Estaría tocando timbre en otra puerta
Quien iba a pensar que con mi billetera
Estaría comprando pan en otra tienda
No es tu asunto lo que yo haga por la calle
A ti te gusto mala

Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las cosas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las vainas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Mi mala

Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí

No me esperes que no sé si llego
Yo llego si me da la gana
Vos y yo dejamos claro el juego
Vos mi malo y yo tu mala

Hay unos días que ando loca por ti
Te veo y quiero todo lo que traes ahí
Y luego ya no quiero nada
Sí, yo soy así, así
Tú no lo puedes parar
Cada mañana quieres más y más
No me puedes evitar
Yo soy tu mala (su mala)

Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las cosas claras (ay ay ay ay ay ay)
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo (yeah)
Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las vainas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Mi mala

Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí (uoh)
Ahí, ahí, ahí (uoh)
Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí

Becky G
Si los celos y la rabia contaminan
Nos bañamos con jabón y se nos quita
No hay invento, ni secreto, ni mentira
Que los dos comemos de otra cucharita
Y luego por la mañana estamos como si nada
No es tu asunto lo que yo haga por la calle
A ti te gusto mala

Tú me dices que soy tu mala
Te quedas mirándome a solas y no me hablas
Porque te gusta que en la noche
Sea tu cuerpo quien me habla y quien me toque
Esto no es amor, ni entretenimiento
Es como una cosa que queda en el medio
Cuando quiero, quieres
Cuando quieras, quiero
Y si tú, y si tú

Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las cosas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas (no no no no)
Dejemos las vainas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Mi mala

Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí (te tengo aquí)
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti (en la palma de mi lengua)
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí (no, oh)
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Sé que no eres sola (sé que no eres solo)
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo (y yo no soy sola)
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí (ahí)
Ahí, ahí, ahí (ahí)

Yo' Grace
No soy solo pa' ti mi amor
Pero a quién entiende' mami
Lali (cómeme la boca, mala, mala)
Mau y Ricky (cómeme la boca, mala, mala)
Con Karol G (cómeme la boca, mala, mala)
Karol G, Becky G, Leslie G, baby
Tú ere' mi mala
Ay, como me gusta mi mala
Cómeme la boca, mala, mala
Cómeme la boca, mala, mala

Lyrics :

Imagine 20 years with a bitter bitch and same the drama
Dame told you do this shit and you don’t see Dame karma
K9 on your ass, nigga no distraction
Pussy nigga wearin' pink I guess he think he matchin'
I’ma paint the picture, let the niggas make the caption
Fuck bars I’m tell nigga what really happened
You hear this tone, you know the mac is in my seat
You see exactly what I see you know my rap is not for free
You sent them pussy niggas to the hill to trap me in my vee
You singing nigga, ain't gonna be no back up bitch wit me
I chew that nigga til’ my teeth hurt don’t even hit the weed first
Bitches used to say I’m blessed and I didn’t even sneeze first
Much dirt as I got on you, don’t even need no research
My hand filthy, heart guilty, niggas like me need church
Tax know you as the nigga that snitched on the Roc
D.C. crips only know you the nigga they shot
OG niggas don’t have no history with you on the block
And everybody seen the footage I got
Every since 10 you was a thirsty nigga
I ain't gone talk about the time you fucked your sister
In 2002 you lost 50 pounds, ulcers in liver
And now you tryna sell niggas liquor, NIGGA
You always play the sucker part
Where was all that Rico shit when you left Jim in Rucker
Matter fact I’m on a true life change
But let's get back to that smack and that Tru Life chain
Damn bro
Damn the whole fuckin' land know
After that 50 shit you moved to Orlando
You had the nigga Jim on the radio, where did Cam go?
We all understand though
You not really built for this shit
You not ready to kill for this shit
But no regrets
You gotta lift up a Tech to get Murder respect
Nigga are U-N, you dipped on the set
I’m the fuckin cough in the slime flu
You gone out rhyme who? I’m your prime times 2
I never paid for my mistakes cause that’s not what crime do
Bitches fuck me cause thats what dimes do
Somebody wanna jump in tell em’ come share
I’m starting to feel like we don’t really compare
I'm pretty nigga, wrist litty, sun wear
Diplomat only mean that you ain’t from here
You had a run here but y’all niggas is done here
All these pretty women and y’all niggas bring guns here
You way past the gun line
Every time you talk of me you sound like one time
I fuck the King of rap bitch when I was unsign
And made the nigga Diddy sign me off of one line
Don’t blame for the past and I won’t blame you for the crash
Sent my nigga Huddy on a dummy mission and he crashed
Gilet I know you need money I get
I know your digital sales I know about your digits
I know Sony Red didn’t wanna your shit distribute
I know its crickets so fuck it use my name so they can click it
I made you, I raised you, why would I play you
When you dealing with this power, nigga Flex can’t save
Me amorin, drive the foreign, kick the door in
Lady treat me like him important
I don’t even think of scoring
I just run the floor and D could alleyoop it to me like in Boston
On some Kyrie shit, y’all just talking
Heard that often
Had to rap again, y’all was boring 'em
Now you can tell Dave East ASAP Mob whatever you want
The whole hood know I’m the origin
You robbed Juelz on some Diddy shit
And when Jim start ballin you get back on sissy shit
You even had the nerve to call up Sham
And use his basketball skill to steal the name Jelly Fam
Damn Cam, I thought more of you
But when I think about it, that's really all you do
You really not that fly
You really not that guy
You really not that wise
I’m really not surprise
All pride aside you try to pay Lodi mom’s to side with your lies
Now i’m like fuck it Drago “if he dies he dies”
Ain’t no unity
Ain’t no Children of the Corn
Ain’t no you and me
Any nigga ever got Diplomat Immunity
Was niggas who ratted or ones who snitched on their community
And thats word to my nigga Big L
To my nigga fucking Trell and to that nigga Bigavel
To nigga Loon on all my niggas in the cell
Hope you hold ya head I hope y’all niggas doing well
This Ma$e nigga I invented the curve
I’m the name on the ribbon on the bird
I’m done rapping with you
You’ll always be my bitch you got my fucking name tatted on you",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qlZi623E_1I/sddefault.jpg,0.015221794638788578,0.0005979144113177033,25.45814977973568,0.005486589069492405,0.01581970905010628,0.021306298119598686,2017-11-24,15:48:17,Friday,4,6,25,6,25,32,190,4,48,0,0,5,23,1,1,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.474035194916017,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Men looking for a girlfriend should not date British women, according to controversial dating guru, Richard La Ruina. He says British women are 'overweight' and 'entitled' and Eastern European girls are more feminine, well-mannered and better looking. He joins Good Morning Britain alongside sex and relationships journalist Felicity Morse, who thinks his view perpetuates a damaging perception of female attractiveness.

Lyrics:
The caution tape that you’ve wrapped around my brain
has continued to stay as I’m waiting for a break.
Constantly connecting dots.
Trying my best, consuming facts.
All I’ve learned is what’s done is done,
and you can not change the past.
Helping or hurting? I am numb.
I haven’t felt anything in days.
Confusion is key as I am locked inside,
or am I just really gone?

A constant strain right behind my face.
I’m still waiting for a slight break. 

I know we’re just different.
Keep drinking from the same cup,
it’ll fill you up.
It’ll keep you numb.

Simplify the motions.
Counteract the movements.
Don’t think twice because this is love. 

You are caffeine in my bloodstream.
You are the energy hidden in between two muscles sleeping.
Please don’t wake me up.
I miss myself too much.

All I have is patience.
We all lose strength someday.
I’ve been waiting for a slight break.

The true origins of the term are a bit darker. Following is a transcript of the video.

Why is it called ""Black Friday""? Most people know Black Friday as the day after Thanksgiving, when stores open early and offer various sales. These stores are often ""in the black"" (profitable) that day.

But the true story of Black Friday is darker. The term ""Black Friday"" was first used on Sept. 24, 1869, when two investors, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, drove up the price of gold and caused a crash that day. The stock market dropped 20% and foreign trade stopped. Farmers suffered a 50% dip in wheat and corn harvest value.

In the 1950s, Philadelphia police used the ""Black Friday"" term to refer to the day between Thanksgiving and the Army-Navy game. Huge crowds of shoppers and tourists went to the city that Friday, and cops had to work long hours to cover the crowds and traffic.

Merchants in the area tried to change the name to ""Big Friday,"" but the alternative name never caught on.

By the late 1980s, ""Black Friday"" had spread nationally with the more positive ""red to black"" backstory.

If you want to learn how to lose weight and avoid the biggest weight loss mistakes most commonly made, then you have come to the right video.  In just the next few minutes, I’m going to share with you the 6 biggest weight loss mistakes that are made that are keeping you fat and preventing you from looking the way you want to, this time around.

It is no secret that losing weight can be quite a struggle for many.  This constant battle to drop weight and stick to a diet plan serve only to keep you frustrated and lacking confidence in your ability to stick to something.  This doesn’t have to be the case.  If you understand the real reasons why you are unable to stay consistent, then you will likely unlock your ability to get this right once and for all.  

This starts with not making yourself accountable.  I like to think about this on a much deeper level than just saying you are going to do something and then not doing it.  If only you are accountable to yourself without considering others, you will likely not hold this pursuit as dear as you could.  Instead, think about what your not sticking to the plan could mean for those that find you to be an important part of their life.  Will being unhealthy have an impact on your ability to provide for your family for as long as they are going to need you?  Quite possibly so.  Will failing to care about your own health set the wrong example for your kids who look up to you and everything you do?  Likely so.  Start realizing that others are watching and all of a sudden your own ability to value what it is you are chasing might skyrocket.

Next is failing to find the eating style that fits your nutritional struggles at the moment.  For example, if your main issue is that you mindlessly graze all day and eat at random times and adopt an intermittent fasting approach to fix this, you are likely setting yourself up for failure.  Not because intermittent fasting is incapable of producing weight loss but rather in your specific case it is directly opposite of the mannerisms that are most embedded in your approach to eating right now.  Instead, you would want to do IF if your issues revolved more on frequent large portion eating.

Continuing on with diet and nutrition, what you drink is just as important as what solid foods you put in your mouth when attempting to lose weight.  Failing to drink enough water early in the day is something that I’ve covered before on this channel but is no less important here.  Seventy five percent of us walk around in a chronically dehydrated state.  The secret to combatting dehydration is to never let yourself get there in the first place.  Staying ahead starts with drinking 20-30 ounce of water first thing in the morning. 

Weight training must be a cornerstone of any attempt to lose weight and look good.  Whether you are in clothes or out of them, what you see in the mirror is going to be your most honest and immediate feedback on how much you have been sticking to your plan of losing weight.   No lean muscle gains will be had from simply walking on the treadmill or calling your workout complete after 45 minutes on a stairclimber.  Better start weight training if you want to be impressed and satisfied with what you see looking back at you.

Healthy fats are a great thing for a healthy diet, except when it comes to losing weight, and then they must be eaten in moderation.  Due to the caloric density of fats vs carbohydrates and proteins, you simply cannot go hog wild eating these if you want to be successful in your attempt to lose weight.  This is a common mistake made by people who will argue the health benefits of fats.  I’m not arguing with you one bit.  I’m just saying, confusing healthy foods for foods that will make you skinny is a common mistake and one that you need to be aware of if losing weight is at the top of your goal list.

Finally, you have to some way make this attempt look different from the last time you attempted to lose weight.  The second you slip up trying to lose weight the same exact way that you tried to last time, your mind will be flooded with memories of why you were unable to stay committed and you will likely throw in the towel even faster this time.  Change the gym you go to, the time you train or even add in some supplements.  

If you are looking for a workout plan that tells you exactly what to do each day in the gym as well as what to eat to get ripped and stay ripped year round, head to http://athleanx.com and get one of our ATHLEAN-X Training Systems.  Stop leaving your training to guesswork and chance and start training like an athlete and you will be amazed at what you will be able to accomplish this time.

Lyrics

Verse 1:
Well you know I’m not religious but
Your lovin' is bible 
Teach me how to speak your language 
Make me your disciple 

Pre Chorus:
Laughing in your car
You're eyes shining like the stars
Meet me at the moon cause' we like the altitude 
Feel the heat when you're around 
Got the seats layin' down
Love the way you move when it’s just me and you 

Chorus: 
Well you know I'm not religious but 
Your lovin' is bible 
We could paint our love all over town
Watch it go viral

Making me feel like I could go crazy 
You are the only one who can save me 
I know, you know you got me going crazy 
But your lovin' is bible your lovin' is bible

Verse 2:
Take me to your holy places treat you like an idol 
Confessing all my secrets to ya with no denial

Pre Chorus:
So we roll the windows down
It's so hot when you're around
I love the way you move when it's just me and you

Chorus: 
Well you know I'm not religious but 
This lovin' is bible 
We could paint our love all over town
Watch it go viral

Making me feel like I could go crazy 
You are the only one who can save me 
I know, you know you got me going crazy 
But your lovin' is bible your lovin' is bible

Bridge:
Would you take me there?
Cause ya know I gotta have ya (x2)
Would you take me there?
Cause ya know I gotta have ya (x2)

I first heard about the boy beat in an interview with Beyonce's makeup artist. This was her look in the formation music video where she was sitting on the police car. For him it was much more about brow and cheekbone but I wanted to add freckles and dark circles to really make it look boyish and Dane Dehaan- inspired. Other examples of this look would be Cara Delevingne's everyday or Taylor Swift's Wonder cover. It's very refreshing to take a break from using winged liner, overdrawn lips, exaggerated cat eyes just to achieve the goal of looking hyper feminine. Another cool thing about this look is it can serve as a base for anything. Add a red lip and it'll have an effortless South of France feel. Add some liner and you'll look like Shane from the L word. I hope you have fun playing around with this look!

The biggest thing we wanted to see was the brand new marquee for Toy Story Land featuring a gigantic Woody figure tipping his hat to the guests as they arrive at Toy Story Land. He was really impressive to see even though we could only see him peaking over the construction walls. We can't wait to see him up close and in person when Toy Story Land opens June 30th. Next we headed over to Grand Ave to see what kind of progress we could see on Star Wars: A Galaxy's Edge construction. Disney has planted trees along the burm that surrounds Galaxy's Edge so it is definitely getting harder to see any progress on the construction from within Disney's Hollywood Studios. We were able to see a little as we drove in though and it is moving right along. We also took a trip over to Star Wars Launch Bay to see if they had any movie memorabilia from the new Han Solo movie. They don't have any yet, but they do have some Solo merchandise. We ended the day with a look at some 4th of July merchandise that is now available in the parks. Join us tomorrow for another new video!

[Verse 1]
I will always remember the day you kissed me lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven
But acting like grownups
Like we are in the present, drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this, yeah

[Chorus]
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs

[Verse 2]
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this, yeah

[Chorus]
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love

De este modo, la lista para disputar el partido ante el Real Madrid es la siguiente: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Piqué, Rakitic, Sergio, Denis, A. Iniesta, Suárez, Messi, Cillessen, Mascherano, Paulinho, Jordi Alba, Digne, S. Roberto, A. Gomes, Aleix Vidal y Vermaelen.

Antes de la convocatoria, el equipo ha realizado la última sesión preparatoria antes de afrontar el Clásico. Una sesión que se ha realizado en el camp Tito Vilanova de la Ciudad Deportiva y en el que Valverde ha contado con los jugadores disponibles del primer equipo, así como con los jugadores Aleñá y Ortolá, del Barça B. La expedición azulgrana viajará este viernes por la tarde hacia Madrid, donde descansará en el hotel de concentración hasta dos horas antes del Clásico.

Only time will tell...

I hope Jeff has more special guests in the future. This was fun to make. This was supposed to be a quick, short video but I've had very little time for editing these last few weeks. Blah blah usual story.
I've got two other videos in the works: one is the standard ""make the funny words come out of Jeff's mouth"" dev update style,
the other is similar... but different. Not sure when they'll be done, I'll keep chipping away at them.

My special request to Blizzard is a Kaplan x Hawley developer update. Pls make it so.

 ABOUT Beyond Good and Evil 2:
 
Journey to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games! Fight alongside unforgettable characters in a stunning new solar system, as you struggle for freedom and the right to determine your own fate among the stars. Play the adventure by yourself or with friends in a vast and seamless online playground.
 
Beyond Good and Evil 2 is the spiritual successor to the cult classic, a prequel that will transport players into a profoundly multicultural world, capturing the spirit of the original with grandiose decors and intense dramas that play out across a vast universe. Through the Space Monkey Program, Ubisoft Montpellier will be developing the game alongside its community of fans.
 
System 3 has become the center of interstellar trade and colonization in the Milky Way of the 24th century, thanks to the creation of Hybrid slaves. While private enterprises fight over resources and power, the first colonists weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth to give meaning to their existence. In this new era of piracy, we will rise from lowly pirate to legendary captain at the helm of massive star-faring vessels, adventuring alongside crews of colorful characters to fight for freedom and the right to determine our own fate among the stars!

Join your new favorite YouTube chef, ya boy, Aleks for a very special lesson in haute cuisine. Step into the mind of a master and learn this exotic interpretation of traditional polpo alla griglia. Ya boy is unveiling his prep secrets, modern updates, and what are sure to be some paradigm-shifting surprises.

The following is for those multicultural:

l polpo di scoglio, conosciuto anche come “polpo verace”,è quello dalle carni più delicate e pregiate e si riconosce dalla doppia serie di ventose su ogni tentacolo. Invece il moscardino, in genere di dimensioni più piccole, di ventose ne possiede una fila sola e in genere si pesca su fondali sabbiosi. Predilegete sempre il polpo verace che sulla griglia rende sicuro meglio. Se lo avete appena pescato dovrete sciacquarlo bene in acqua dolce e eliminare gli organi interni (che nel polpo sono nella testa), togliere gli occhi e il dente cartilagineo (al centro dei tentacoli, all’interno della testa) e sciacquare bene.

Erik Noren has been custom building bicycles all of his life. He owns Peacock Groove Bicycles in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He can build Transporter bikes, Cargo Trike bikes, Road Race Bikes,  Velodrome Racing Bikes, Mountain bikes, Beach Cruiser bikes and more!

In this video, Erik Noren shows you the steps in assembling a custom built fat tire mountain bike. He starts by sharing steps on mounting a tubeless fat tire onto a 24"" HED Cycling rim. Then installs the gear cogs and disc brakes. Next, Erik prepares the Cake bike frame for the crank and sprocket. The custom made fat tire front fork and headset are next. Erik installs raceface handle bars and ESI racing hand grips. He uses a Shimano SLX derailer kit and blue cable lines to match the anodized blue raceface sprocket chain ring.

In this week's Sound Bank 14, I did some exploring into the world of Bossa Nova and I would like to share with you all some footage and notes from this mini immersion.  I include Pocket Piece No. 8 “New Bossa,” a composition I wrote inspired by this experience (not intended to be a bossa nova tune but I tried to incorporate elements of Bossa Nova into it).

Lyrics:
You're always moving in the unseen
The breath You exhale sustaining me
Before I call, You know my need
You're always going before me

I'm confident Your faithfulness will see me through
My soul can rest, my righteousness is found in You
With every moment left, in every borrowed breath, let this be true
That all my heart, for all my life, belongs to You

Your laughter scatters my enemies
You give me joy for my mourning
You lift my head so I can see
All of heaven surrounding me

I'm confident Your faithfulness will see me through
My soul can rest, my righteousness is found in You
With every moment left, in every borrowed breath, let this be true
That all my heart, for all my life, belongs to You

I won't win this battle with the strength in my own hands
You're the mountain-mover and only You can
I won't build my life on sinking sand
You're my hope forever, the rock where I stand
I won't win this battle with the strength in my own hands
You're the mountain-mover and only You can
I won't build my life on sinking sand
You're my hope forever, the rock where I stand!
The rock where I stand!
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

I'm confident Your faithfulness will see me through
My soul can rest, my righteousness is found in You
With every moment left, in every borrowed breath, let this be true
That all my heart, for all my life, belongs to You",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r32B_vLqC-Y/sddefault.jpg,0.004115626689891684,0.0001516227641071181,27.143857415658807,0.00010230434751976138,0.004267249453998802,0.004369553801518563,2018-05-04,21:30:00,Friday,4,10,19,10,19,64,190,5,43,2,0,5,0,0,0,6.0,9.0,"['re', '', '   ', '  ', '', '  ', '', '| mM', '', '; i \\']","['re', '|', 'mM', ';', 'i', '\\']",True,"['re', '|', 'mM', ';', 'i', '\\']",6,6,8,3,0,0,2,6.68003081327124,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

The journey begins this April. #IMAXPandas 🐼

Pandas are beloved around the world, and now they are coming to the big screen in the IMAX® original film “Pandas,” a breathtaking documentary adventure and amazing experience for the whole family.

At Chengdu Panda Base in China, scientists are dedicated to protecting the species by breeding adult Giant Pandas in order to introduce cubs into the wild.  This film follows one such researcher, whose passion leads her to initiate a new technique inspired by a black bear program in rural New Hampshire.  What starts as a cross-culture collaboration becomes a life-changing journey for an American biologist who crosses an ocean to join her; a scientist from Inner Mongolia; and a very curious female cub named Qian Qian, born in captivity.

Captured with IMAX® Cameras, join Qian Qian on an exciting new adventure in the mountains of Sichuan as she takes her first steps outside her protected habitat, discovering her true animal nature…even as she faces the challenges of the unknown.

David Douglas and Drew Fellman, the filmmakers behind “Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar,” directed the film, which Fellman wrote and produced, with Douglas as director of photography.  Donald Kushner and Steve Ransohoff also produced the film, with Li Gen Xiong and Elie Samaha executive producing and Neal Allen serving as line producer.

“Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar” editor Beth Spiegel and composer Mark Mothersbaugh collaborated with Douglas and Fellman once again, with sound design by Gus Koven.

IMAX Entertainment presents, in association with IMAX Documentary Films Capital and Panda Productions, “Pandas.”   The film will be released in select IMAX® and IMAX® 3D theaters starting April 6, 2018.  The film is rated G.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r3eaGCk2Acs/sddefault.jpg,0.008667345779108283,0.00017720280911000632,48.91201117318435,2.474899568575507e-07,0.00884454858821829,0.008844796078175147,2018-02-21,16:00:16,Wednesday,2,5,24,5,21,30,200,3,49,4,0,0,2,0,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.930186924445502,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'bear': 3, 'dog': 1, 'cat': 3, 'person': 2}",9

HisStory started way back in high school for Rodrique “Drique” Roberts and Jalil Harris, originating nearly 10 years ago in Atlanta. The group, also featuring Travis Belton and JaJuan “JD” Glasper, has withstood tough times, including losing loved ones and economic hardships, to continue to follow their dream as performers.  After a near break up, the opportunity to perform on Best.Cover.Ever. reignited their commitment and stamina.

A lifelong Keith Urban fan, Emma Lynn White moved to Nashville to become a songwriter and was told by her mother she would one day play alongside her country superstar idol. A fitness and outdoors enthusiast, Emma has found a niche playing beach bars and restaurants along the East Coast as she continues the dream of being a Nashville songwriter and country singer.

When it came time for Sean Evans to dive head first into the menu at Jeepney Filipino Gastropub in NYC, the choice for a dinner companion was a no-brainer. From staples like chicken adobo and arroz caldo, to now-legendary dishes like halo-halo and balut, Jo breaks down the Filipino food dos and don’ts as only he could. Will Sean convince Jo to give balut another shot, or will he swear off bird embryos for ever? Find out on an all new SITW.

In an interview with Channel 4 News, the filmmaker tells presenter Jon Snow:
 
“If she declares her candidacy without question I would donate to her campaign.
 
“But she hasn’t done that yet. I’m not sure that she intended the great speech she gave on receipt of the Cecil B DeMille Award at the Golden Globes last week. I don’t really believe that was throwing her hat in the ring.
 
“She was talking about the elephant in the room. There should be no more elephants in the room. We have to talk about it. We have to stop avoiding it. And she said some very important things.”

When the Teen Titans go to the big screen, they go big!  “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” finds our egocentric, wildly satirical Super Heroes in their first feature film extravaganza—a fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the super hero genre, complete with musical numbers.

It seems to the Teens that all the major super heroes out there are starring in their own movies—everyone but the Teen Titans, that is!  But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick.  If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them.  With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.  But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously Super-Villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry.  The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line!

Will Arnett (“The LEGO® Batman Movie”) and Kristen Bell (“Frozen”) lend their voices to the first-ever big-screen version of DC Entertainment and Cartoon Network’s animated TV show, which also stars Greg Cipes (TV’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”) as Beast Boy, Scott Menville (TV’s “Spider-Man”) as Robin, Khary Payton (“The Walking Dead”) as Cyborg, Tara Strong (the “My Little Pony” franchise) as Raven, and Hynden Walch (TV’s “Adventure Time with Finn & Jake”) as Starfire, reprising their roles from the series.

The film is being directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath, based on characters from DC.  Michail, Will Arnett and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers.  Apart from Arnett, all are “Teen Titans GO!” series contributors.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9WhJyyTtqo/sddefault.jpg,0.004030416003674169,0.001069734836438655,3.7676776210188403,1.717070363464936e-06,0.005100150840112824,0.005101867910476289,2018-05-01,16:00:26,Tuesday,1,11,28,11,27,55,199,4,37,2,0,7,16,2,2,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.7818670985211025,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

This week, I’m putting a SWEET twist on traditional Christmas gift wrapping. Forget wrapping paper and boxes, it’s all about wrapping gifts in cake now! To make my Surprise Inside Gift Box Cake, I wrapped my NEW Google Chromebook up in layers of Ultimate Vanilla Cake, Italian Meringue buttercream & sweet fondant details. That way, you can have your CAKE this Christmas, and eat it too!

But does he have what it takes to make his own concoction? Anxious to turn the tables, Sean teams up with Hot Ones legend Erica Diehl—better known as Queen Majesty—for a crash-course in the hot sauce-making commandments. From a mild pineapple and jalapeño sauce to a fiery ""Sicilian"" scorpion blend, Sean learns how to slice, chop, and churn his way to new hot-sauce heights.

A special thank you to Homesweet Homegrown for supplying the scorpion peppers. The pineapple and jalapeño recipe will appear in a forthcoming cookbook from High River Sauce's Steve Seabury.

US Release Date: May 11, 2018
Starring: Debby Ryan, Melissa McCarthy, Gillian Jacobs

Synopsis: When her husband suddenly dumps her, longtime dedicated housewife Deanna turns regret into re-set by going back to college - landing in the same class and school as her daughter, who's not entirely sold on the idea. Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna -- now Dee Rock -- embraces freedom, fun, and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.

https://www.broadway.com/shows/children-lesser-god/

Stage and screen star Joshua Jackson discusses finding his happy place in the theater, getting to know his CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD co-star Lauren Ridloff, the end of DAWSON'S CREEK and more.

Here are some must-read highlights:

ON GETTING CLOSE FOR PHOTO SHOOTS
""We shot the photo for the CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD poster about halfway through the out-of-town run last summer, so we were quite used to being in each other&rsquo;s faces at that point. Lots of breath mints were involved.""

ON THE REVIEW HE CAN STILL RECITE:
""I did have one scathingly bad review during A LIFE IN THE THEATRE, which is of course, the only review that I remember. But it was brilliantly bad. The critic said I looked like, 'an American cockroach that had been flipped on its back trying to right itself onstage.' That's pretty bad. t’s only been 17 years. I’m sure I’ll forget about it eventually. THE EVENING STANDARD. Oh yes, I remember.”

ON TURNING 40:
“I didn’t put a timeline on coming to Broadway, but it is an excellent birthday present for 40. Every year that clicks by is another year where I think, ‘I can’t believe I still get to tell stories for a living. This is amazing!”

ON MAKING HIS BROADWAY DEBUT
“The experience of doing a play is such a joyful thing. It’s not the place where I spend the bulk of my work life, so when I do get the opportunity to come and do it, it’s because something really specific that I want to be a part of, a story that I want to tell. To walk up to work every day and and walk onto a Broadway stage is a pretty magical feeling for an actor.”

ON THE DISCOVERY OF CO-STAR LAUREN RIDLOFF
“Kenny Leon was putting together a read-through and had assembled a bunch of people. He called me up. He said, ‘I’ve found everybody else, but I haven’t found my leading lady. I do have this woman, who has been teaching me ASL, who for purposes of the read-through, I think would be amazing.’ She comes in on day one of rehearsal, and we get to the climactic scene in the play where Sarah uses her voice. Lauren says, through her interpreter, ‘I haven’t spoken out loud since I was 13.’ Flash forward the next day, we’re going through the play with people watching. We finally get to that scene. There’s this electricity building, and when she let it go it was a nearly indescribable experience. It was just this raw, emotional outpouring. It was one of those moments that can only happen in a live space. Kenny and I went out to get a drink afterwards, and I was like, ‘Man, that’s the whole thing right there.’”

ON LEARNING ASL
“Particularly for a leading man and leading lady, it’s important to get to know each other, to sort of understand who each other are, especially if you’re going to places that are uncomfortable. I had done quite a bit of work before I got to rehearsal, but had a lot more work yet to do just to get the language of the play down. So we would spend a day in rehearsal, and then she, I and Alexandria Wailes, our ASL director for the show, would then just break out another four hours and slowly but surely build me into a place where I was at like a post-toddler level in that language.”

ON THE END OF DAWSON’S CREEK
“It was such a long and ultimately complete experience because we knew we were going to end it when we were going to end it. So it was just this tremendous sense of relief. To be perfectly honest, I was quite burnt out at the end of Dawson’s Creek. There were many satisfying moments throughout that experience, but there were also many unsatisfying moments. If I could have ended it a couple of years earlier than we did, I would have.”

ON FINDING HIS HAPPY PLACE IN THE THEATER
“After Dawson’s Creek ended, I knew within a couple of months that I was going to go and do David Mamet’s A Life in the Theatre with Patrick Stewart. The plays that I’ve worked on in my life have all been very specific to a time in my life where there was a challenge or a question that I needed to have answered for myself. To put myself in Mamet’s language in the West End, a two-hander with just Patrick Stewart, is about the deepest of the deep end that you can possibly go into. He is such a skilled theater actor. If he had wanted to slaughter me onstage just to showcase his talents, he absolutely could have done that. That was within his power. But he’s not that man. He was incredibly gracious in allowing my learning curve—which was very steep for that show. Seeing his joy in it and discovering my own joy in it, I thought, ‘Oh right! I’m an actor. This is really truly what I want to do. I love this.’”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rBeJLZzaccQ/sddefault.jpg,0.01664102922668158,0.0,inf,0.0016780869808418403,0.01664102922668158,0.018319116207523425,2018-04-11,16:28:32,Wednesday,2,13,12,13,12,74,94,1,17,5,0,7,9,4,2,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.91733884326069,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Track Name: Busted by John Deley 

If you want to hear the effects of the up-conversion of a cassette yourself - you can download the audio here: https://bit.ly/2KB6PVn

To make these files, first two identical recordings of the track 'Busted' were made onto one tape in one continuous go (the track was on repeat) from a Sony HAP-S1 digital audio player onto a Sony TC-K333ESJ which contained new-old-stock TDK SA90 tape. This tape was then played back on the Toshiba TY-AK1 - the first track with the Up-convert option off and the second with it switched on. The recordings were done from the headphone output into a PCM recorder (WAV format). These recordings are unedited. 

If you just want to see the end comedy sketch on it's own - it's here:  https://youtu.be/U6hl04gubJA
If you want to see the rest of the comedy outros - they're all collected in this playlist that can only be accessed by the people who read video description text boxes (that's you) - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN2yCnHTG_6rlyYFpwUX2u0m_HVHpHO0F

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Let me know what you think about Star Wars Episode 8 The Last Jedi. It would be a decent sci - fi action movie... but did not feel like Star Wars!
I know that a lot of people believe that DISNEY is ruining Star Wars

Okay, so wtf happened here? Snoke better still be alive, why did Luke have to die in this one!? and Reys parents.... seriously (better be kylo ren trying to trick her. Captain Phasma was thrown away .... similar to the awkward Luke's light saber reaction... ahhh i don't know, too much comedy too? 

Porgs didn't annoy me as much as i thought though...

Here are Blake's 4 top winter riding prep tips.

Clothing: It’s often said, “there’s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing”. So before you head out for a ride, make sure you’ve got clothing with you for whatever weather you might encounter. For example if it’s going to be really wet and muddy, consider wearing some waterproof riding trousers.

Bike prep: You don’t need to change too much on your bike compared to summer riding. Make sure your bike is always clean, with a well lubed chain, and a good amount of grease on any bearings. The only other thing you may want to consider is using a more aggressive treaded tyre with lower pressures.

Location: Winter is a great time for heading further abroad and trying out some new trails. Especially look for sandy trails as these drain well when it's wet.

Post-ride: Make sure you bring either a heavy duty plastic bag, or a plastic box with you if you drive to the trails. This way you can stop your dirty kit from getting mud all over your car's interior. Similarly a rug or tarpaulin is useful if you need to put your muddy bike inside your car.

conversation with Jay-Z began with O.J.

When I was a kid growing up in black New Orleans in the 1960s, O.J. Simpson was a god. We imitated his moves, his swagger. We didn’t want to just play like him. We wanted to be him, gorgeous and running in the California sun. We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American, clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as “The Great One.” We were triumphant when he won it the next year.

But O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote.

So when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his song “The Story of O.J.,” from his most recent album, “4:44,” in which he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line “I’m not black, I’m O.J.”

I was less engaged by the rapper’s marital troubles or his infamous, caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self — a black man who grew up in the ’70s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn. It seemed from his new body of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had been stirring more deeply within him — much the way it stirs in me, a Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for me.

What is it about the story of O.J. Simpson that moved us both?

O.J. must have locked down part of himself when he presented himself as the noncontroversial star who never talked about race, the perfect foil for his fellow football player, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, who seemed more threatening, angry. I had to wonder if the pressure of that denial caused him to explode decades later.

All of this was on my mind when I met with Jay-Z for two hours in an executive office at The Times this past September. Besides O.J. and racial identity, we talked about his mother’s sexuality, and how he could possibly raise socially aware children who shuttled between mansions: After years of rapping about growing up in the ‘hood, he has produced an album that sounds like a middle-aged black man’s deeply introspective therapy session put to music.

Im Blockbuster-Sequel Pacific Rim 2: Uprising setzt Steven S. DeKnight Guillermo del Toros Monster-Spektakel fort.

Handlung von Pacific Rim 2: Uprising
Seit die Erde in Pacific Rim mithilfe der Jaeger, riesiger Kampfroboter, von den überdimensionalen Monstern namens Kaiju befreit wurde, sind einige Jahre vergangen. Doch die Welt ist nach der abgewendeten Invasion nicht mehr dieselbe. Die Jaeger-Piloten Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) und Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) müssen nun nicht mehr gegen die Kaiju ins Feld ziehen, doch die Technologie ihrer Kampf-Maschinen wurde nicht ad acta gelegt. Es ist die Stunde für Wissenschaftler wie Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) und seinen Kollegen Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) gekommen.

Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, and Veronica Lodge are the iconically loveable characters from the Archie Comics. “Riverdale” flipped this small town innocent story on its head, adapting it into a darkly mysterious teenage tv show. With more secrets than truth, love triangles, this show has it all. What does the CW Network and Netflix not want its fans to know? How about the serious threats that season two actor, Vanessa Morgan playing Toni Topaz, received. And why did the casting process turn down lead star Camila Mendes? Is David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” involved in the show? How did KJ Apa sacrifice himself for his role? And why is Jughead hotter than ever?

Do you think you’re the ultimate “Riverdale” fan? Well then, watch this video revealing 10 Dark Secrets Riverdale Tried To Hide and see if you know them all. These shockingly dark secrets reveal the side we don’t see on screen. Just wait until you hear number one!

Lyrics:
I don't want to worry no more

Stop messing with my money now
Like a walk in the park
I got love til it runneth out
Being rich is hip as fuck
I got friends I got fun
Got no worries til it all dry up
And I can make it rain
Wash away the pain
Any doubts I might not be enough
Shit I know what you mean
Everybody want it
Not the cash though its freedom

I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I want to be the star on the scene

Cuz I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I’m gonna be the star on the scene

Tell you what I'm chasing something never was
Rich Dad Poor Dad
Ain't got one to pull me up
Feel the panic kicking in
I know I can't stop
Higher I get closer it seems to where I was
Give me some time
Make me happy give me love
If money buy me that I'm never letting up
You keep the fame keep the phony canned applause
I'll keep on dreaming keep on rising high above

Cuz I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I’m gonna be the star on the scene

I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I wanna be the star on the scene

Cuz I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I’m gonna to be the star on the scene
