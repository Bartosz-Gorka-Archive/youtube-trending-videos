After an experiment gone wrong, A.X.L. is discovered hiding alone in the desert by a kind-hearted outsider named Miles (Alex Neustaedter), who finds a way to connect with him after activating his owner-pairing technology.  Together, the two develop a special friendship based on trust, loyalty and compassion. Helping Miles gain the confidence he’s been lacking, A.X.L. will go to any length to protect his new companion, including facing off against the scientists who created him and who will do anything to get him back.
Knowing what is at stake if A.X.L. is captured, Miles teams up with a smart, resourceful ally named Sara (Becky G) to protect his new best friend on a timeless, epic adventure for the whole family.

Horror movies are always at their best when the third act goes a little off the rails. Thriller endings are supposed to leave us feeling either satisfied or completely unsatisfied, and nowhere in between. So, when a scary movie actually delivers that grand finale that ties all its terror tricks together, it can be pretty unforgettable. Let's take a look back at some of those horror flicks that really stuck the landing before the turn of the millennium. And, it should go without saying, spoilers for these old movies lay ahead...

-At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, a panel of five Trump nominees for lifetime appointments to federal judgeships were interviewed simultaneously about their qualifications. A video, posted Thursday by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), showed that the process did not go well for one of them.

Matthew S. Petersen, Trump’s pick to be a United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, was the only one who raised his hand when Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) asked if any of the five had “never tried a case to verdict in a courtroom.” He then confessed that he also never participated a jury, criminal, or civil trial, in a state or federal court, had taken less than 10 depositions, and had never argued a motion in state or federal court.---",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-0LcTIEiu9Y/sddefault.jpg,0.030152005980563168,0.001135199490544619,26.560975609756106,0.012847135697870807,0.03128720547110779,0.0441343411689786,2017-12-16,05:30:00,Saturday,5,9,56,9,48,72,503,2,101,0,0,8,7,1,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.500616198128838,2,"['sad', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"{'tie': 2, 'person': 4}",6

MovieBob get's it over with (or starts to...) and maps out the first half of how the already-rumored emergency reboot of the ailing DC Extended Universe. First up: Ground rules, FLASHPOINT and how not to screw up JUSTICE LEAGUE a second time.

*FWIW, I'm not really 100% satisfied with how this came out - having to cut after the FLASHPOINT stuff sort of makes it feel like I'm saying ""wall-to-wall fanservice will save the day!"" when the full-on point I was aiming for was more ""purge it ALL from the system and start fresh; but if I hadn't cut to two parts this would've been almost an hour long and kind of a slog. Hopefully y'all still enjoy it, and it comes together better when PART II runs - cheers :)

NEXT WEEK: Okay, you've rebooted your universe - Now what?

The Black Panther world premiere was last night in Los Angeles and the purple carpet was a royal affair. 

The Black Panther carpet may have been purple, but All other red carpets can go home because this premiere just shut everything down. 

Black excellence was alive and well last night on the Black Panther premiere and I am LIVING for it. In fact after I saw these photos  I died, vacationed in heaven, and then came back to life only to have my edges snatched by Angela Bassett. The cast, crew, and attendees wore African regalia garments and inspired pieces that easily made this premiere one of my favorite celebrations and displays of culture I have ever seen on a carpet. 

Lupita Nyong’o was the epitome of purple reign and when I say reign I mean R-E-I-G-N. She wore a Versace gown that made her look like the queen she is and hands down my favorite look of the night. Angela Basset stunned in yellow fringe with a collar fit for royalty. She accessorized with gold accents including bangles and fan earrings. She told ET QUOTE - ""This is the night you can be over the top -- we are in Wakanda, right? It's all about colors, all about heat, and I think we're bringing that tonight on the purple carpet.""
The regalia continued with Janelle Monae who looked like she just stepped out of reigning over her own kingdom in a strapless black gown with white and blue puffed sleeves complete with a colorful choker and crown. Issa Rae was another one of my favorites of the night in a white pleated gown with chrome accents in the lining of the dress. Seriously there were so many looks that caused me to bald I can’t even name them all. Chloe and Halle looked like glam warriors, Yara Shahidi looked beautiful, and while the queens of the night were aplenty, the carpet was also filled with kings as well. Chadwick Boseman, Sterling K Brown, Donald Glover, David Oyelowo (Oh-yeah-la-wa), the list goes on. This carpet was so lit and so frickin bomb, you already know Twitter was in a frenzy. 
One of my favorite tweets was QUOTE - “I feel like these outfits were for anyone that tries to deny how African #BlackPanther is set to be. As in this movie is clearly going to be unapologetically black and you expect me not be excited? Please. I mean, look at them all wearing their traditional African clothes that we used to get bullied for at school on the red (purple) carpet for a World Premiere.” Danielle Brooke wrote - “Yo! Black folks out here looking like the ROYALTY that we are on this #BlackPanther carpet!! Yessss!!!” Another said – “The pictures from the Black Panther premiere are the definition of Black Excellence!” 

On the carpet, the costume designer for the film Ruth E. Carter said QUOTE - ""I was hoping for this. All of the award shows I was watching on TV, I was like, ‘Oh, you wait until Black Panther’ red carpet rolls around. It's a celebration.” 

The film is getting rave reviews with some calling it the best Marvel film yet. A representative from Indie Wire wrote – “#BlackPanther is riveting on many levels: visually astonishing, but more importantly, so unpredictable. Incredible to watch a major blockbuster celebrate blackness while exploring its relationship to various facets of pop culture. “Stop scaring me,” colonizer!” #wakanda4ever.” Another said – “Black Panther looks, feels and sounds unlike any Marvel film to date. A visual feast. Wakanda is amazingly realized, the antagonist actually has an arc with emotional motivations. Marvels most political movie. So good. #BlackPanther” The film has already broken records with ticket sales and will no doubt continue to shatter records when it hits theaters on February 16th. I am so ready. I will be attending in full blown regalia thank you very much. What do you guys think about the jaw dropping premiere looks?

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

안녕하세요 오늘은 티라미수 케이크를 준비했어요 
마스카포네 치즈를 사용해서 신맛이 없고, 부드러워요 

크림치즈 동량으로 쓰셔도 괜찮고 반반 섞으셔도 됩니다
데코는 마음대로 하셔도 됩니다 저는 미니 마카롱와 스포이드로 장식했어요 
(스포이드 안에는 남은 커피 시럽을 넣었어요)

크림이 많이 남을 것 같았는데 거의 딱 맞더라구요
높은 1호 무스링을 사용했습니다 (시트 굽는 틀도 1호 약 15cm)
일반 2호 무스링을 쓰셔도 됩니다 

▶재료 (15cm x 7cm 케이크 1개 분량)
+ 케이크 시트
계란 3개, 설탕 80g, 바닐라 익스트랙 4ml, 박력분 70g, 코코아가루 15g, 식용유 20g

+ 커피 시럽
뜨거운 물 90ml, 커피가루 5g (인스턴트 커피), 설탕 40g

+ 크림
젤라틴 7g, 우유 20ml, 생크림 220ml, 설탕 120g, 마스카포네 치즈 380g

+ 마무리
코코아가루 (+기타 데코 재료) 

★ 마스카포네 치즈 = 크림치즈, 커피가루(인스턴트커피) = 에스프레소 1샷

- 케이크 시트 
1) 오븐을 180도로 예열 후 흰자와 노른자 분리합니다
2) 노른자에 설탕과 바닐라를 넣고 섞어줍니다 
3) 뽀얀색이 되면 흰자를 휘핑합니다 
4) 남은 설탕을 넣어가며 뿔이 서는 머랭을 휘핑합니다
5) 머랭 반을 노른자에 넣고 섞어줍니다 
6) 박력분과 코코아가루를 채쳐 넣고 섞어줍니다 
7) 날가루가 보이지 않으면 남은 머랭을 넣고 섞어주고 오일도 넣고 섞어줍니다 
8) 반죽을 준비한 틀에 부어 바닥을 살짝 쳐주고 예열된 180도 오븐에 25~30분 굽습니다
9) 구운 시트는 꼬치를 찔러봤을 때 반죽이 묻어나오지 않으면 됩니다
10) 시트를 식혀 윗면을 제외한 평평한 부분만 2등분 슬라이스 해둡니다
11) 시트 1장은 약간 작게 잘라둡니다 (무스링이나 커터 등 혹은 칼로 잘라둡니다)
12) 마르지 않게 랩이나 비닐 씌워둡니다 

- 커피 시럽 
1) 뜨거운 물, 커피가루, 설탕을 한 볼에 담아 섞어서 식혀둡니다 

- 크림 
1) 젤라틴을 찬 물에 불려둡니다 
2) 생크림을 휘핑합니다 
3) 설탕을 넣고 50~60% 묽게 휘핑합니다 
4) 실온에 둔 마스카포네 (혹은 크림치즈)를 넣고 섞어줍니다 
5) 불린 젤라틴을 우유에 넣고 전자레인지에 20초 정도 돌려줍니다 
6) 젤라틴이 녹아 우유와 섞이면 크림에 부어 빠르게 섞어줍니다 

- 마무리 ★ 무스띠가 있다면 무스링에 미리 끼워둡니다 
1) 지름 15cm, 높이 7cm 정도의 무스링에 자르지 않은 시트를 깔고 커피시럽을 바릅니다 
2) 만들어둔 크림을 부어주고 조금 작게 자른 시트를 올려 다시 커피시럽을 바릅니다
3) 남은 크림을 부어 채워주고 냉장실에 3시간 이상 두어 굳혀줍니다 
4) 따뜻한 물에 담근 수건을 무스링에 감싸 무스링을 제거합니다 
5) 코코아가루를 채에 내려 뿌려주고 준비한 장식이 있으면 올려줍니다 



※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다

Chowder may be the only pig in Shelby's home, but he's got plenty of friends to keep him company. His friends consists of five dogs that range in breed and sizes from a small Pomeranian mix to a larger dog, which happens to be the German Shepherd, and they all get along just fine in this mixed family.

Chowder has proven that pigs, like other animals, are capable of spreading a lot of love, especially when you rescue them from a life of torture, like Shelby did. Now, Chowder is part of a doggy pack, and they're inseparable.

His canine siblings love to cuddle, take a walk, and just hang around the living room or the patio in the backyard. Obviously, this diverse family loves each other very much and is happy to look after one another.

Oddly enough, both the pig and his doggy sibling appear to have two lovely smiles on their faces and the little pooch wouldn't dare bring up the smell of bacon in front of Chowder.

Aside from sharing how awesome Chowder and his pooch siblings get along on Instagram, Shelby uses social media to spread the love and her cause to help animals like Chowder.

Sure, they're looking all nice and innocent, but one of them is up to something. Chowder is getting ready to have a blast rolling around in the dirt, and probably wrecking Shelby's garden in the process.

When it comes to spending quality time, Chowder has no favorites among his adopted family of dogs. He'll hang out with all of his adoptive siblings from the big pooches to the small ones.

Had Chowder remained in in the Aurora farm in Brazil, he would have undoubtedly remained confined, which would have led to ""repeatedly bite the bars"" of his cage, ""a sign of serious mental collapse."" Fortunately, she spared him from that horror.

When Shelby had first adopted Chowder, he was nothing more than a little piglet, who would grow.

Growing up with a family full of dogs is a whole lot better than growing up in a cage at a farm. Chowder gets to experience the true love that every creature on the planet deserves to have

It's safe to say that these dogs and Chowder are living a happy life in Shelby's home, indoor and out.

Love is definitely a powerful force that can transcend just about anything, and that includes species.

While Chowder and the pooches aren't related by blood, they've proven that a little love is always welcomed. Just look at these two touching noses. It's so darn adorable. Doesn't it just melt your heart?

Often neglected for a deep-fryer and a vat of oil, the giant pan makes for a crispier, juicier final product, and requires non-stop focus from the chef. At Charles’ Country Pan Fried Chicken, whole birds are butchered, battered, and then flipped one-by-one in the pan until golden brown. A staple in Harlem, New York, and a boon to home cooks everywhere, the pan-fried style perfected by Gabriel will change the way you look at fried chicken.

Here's the easiest way to do it: check your stool colors and what learn they mean. As gross as it may sound, the color and shape of your stool can reveal a lot about your health. Any changes you might notice can be a sign of a serious disease.

SUMMARY
- If you see separate solid lumps reminiscent of nuts or goat feces in your toilet bowl, it is likely a sign of severe constipation. This type of stool means your body lacks fiber. 
- Sausage-shaped, large, and lumpy stool speaks of constipation.
This type of stool is also caused by a lack of fiber. 
- If the cracked sausage-shaped stool is what you usually have, there are no reasons to worry. That’s a normal stool. You’re doing just fine! 
- If you stand with those whose feces are soft, sausage-shaped, and smooth – congratulations! Your stool is as perfect as stool can be! 
- Soft lumps with clear edges are a sign of light diarrhea.
It could also mean that you are experiencing irritable bowel syndrome. 
- If your stool comes in fluffy pieces with ragged edges, it looks like you are having mild diarrhea. Remember how we told you to have more fiber? Well, in this case, it is just the opposite. Maybe there’s too much fiber in your diet. 
- Liquid without solid pieces type of feces is what no one likes to see. It speaks of severe diarrhea. 

Do you take problems with your stools seriously? Do you consult doctors when needed? Feel free to share in the comments section below!

SPOILERS AHEAD: The first sentence of the novelization of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' reads: Luke Skywalker stood in the cooling sands of Tatooine, his wife by his side. It is later confirmed that this is a dream sequence in the story and that Luke never actually had a wife. Luke’s wife in the scene is named Camie which most of you Star Wars fans might recognize as the name of one of Luke’s friends in the deleted scenes from ‘Star Wars: A New Hope’. The imaginary story is set in a world in which Luke gave up R2-D2 and C-3PO to the Empire and never became a Jedi. A number of other things happen to the people he cares about in exchange for not getting involved in the battle against the Empire.

Obviously, there is A LOT to unpack here. Kristian Harloff and Mark Reilly roll up their pant legs and wade into this prologue to give you their initial thoughts on it. They speculate on how different The Last Jedi might have been received if this prologue had been filmed. They also contemplate whether Luke made the right decision in deciding to fight against the Empire and forego the other life he would have had. Let us know what you think of this prologue and about what Kristian and Mark had to say in the Comments section below.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

All of those books on how to understand women have nothing about the biological and social facts of the fairer side of humanity. 
Bright Side looked far and wide to find some pretty awesome and controversial facts about ladies — and here is what we got. 

TIMESTAMPS
Women see more colors. 0:50
The female body has a lower resistance to alcohol. 1:20
Maturity is attractive. 2:04
The average woman will eat 4 lb of lipstick in her lifetime. 2:34
They hate taking risks. 3:07
They might make their men fat. 3:34
Style over comfort. 4:00
A heightened sense of smell. 4:23
The brain cells are packed more densely in the female brain. 4:41
They are the unsung heroes of inventions. 5:41
Heels were for men. 7:36
Women can read faces. 7:57
Long live women! 8:45

SUMMARY
- Women seeing on average 20% more differences in colors and shapes.
- Alcohol is even more dangerous for women as they are more prone to liver disease like hepatitis (an inflammation of the liver) and are more likely to die from liver cirrhosis (a chronic disease).
- Various studies have shown that a woman is more attractive the more fertile she looks, so women who have given birth, grown into a very feminine body, or do not use birth control are way more attractive to men.
- It comes down to women licking off or eating with food about 4 lb of lipstick in their life. That translates to 533.76 lipsticks. 
- The anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that weighs options when making a decision, is larger in women than in men. 
- A lot of men in long-term relationships are getting bigger, and that might be the doing of their women. They go into a “taking care” mode that results in feeding their partner excessively (with the intention of having a strong “warrior” by their side).
- Society and media have been pressing women for centuries to hold themselves to a certain standard.
- The heightened sense of smell helped our ancestors to survive and, as women were mainly gatherers, helped them to pick the right foods for the family.
- The female brain is 9% smaller than its male counterpart. 
- Women over the years have patented: disposable diapers, paper bags, nonreflective glass, the foot-pedal trash can, the dishwasher, and many other innovations.
- Heels were brought into women’s fashion to mimic the men who wore heels as a sign of their masculinity and status.
- Women are better at reading faces, gestures, and voice tones, which makes them superior conversationalists and social leaders. 
- Sometimes the life duration differences between men and women can be up to a decade, but on average it is at least 2–3 years all over the world. 

Even with all that we know about fair ladies, there’s still a ton of mysteries to be unraveled. Which ones are your favorite?

Taylor kicks off her Reputation tour in less than three weeks in Arizona, but according to reports, the sales have not exactly met the expectations. In what the New York Post called a DESPERATE bid to boost ticket sales, Ticket Master offered a promotion this week that cut out service fees, reducing the price of tickets by 19 percent.

Currently, Ticketmaster’s interactive venue charts are showing that plenty of seats are still available at all 40 of Taylor’s North American tour stops. So what’s to blame for the lack of a single sell-out?

It could be the whole “Swift Tix” system that was used to sell tickets in the first place. Swift Tix was a strategy put in place so that fans, and not second parties like scalpers, were the ones actually buying the tickets at face value. In order to get pre-sale access to Reputation tour tickets through Swift Tix, fans had to register and grant Ticket Master access to their personal data, as a way to PROVE that they weren’t resellers. Obviously that also gave the company access to millions of people’s data for future marketing purposes, as a side bonus for the Live Nation subsidiary.

On top of that, those who registered for Swift Tix were given the chance to “bump” their way up the virtual ticket line by buying expensive tour merch, watching videos, or helping market the tour via social media. Fans weren’t exactly thrilled with this “boost” tactic, especially since it was just another way to get them to spend even MORE money, on top of the already very expensive concert ticket prices.

The service fees promotion ended on April 19th, and many fans who previously purchased tickets without getting the promo were frustrated with the deal. One fan Tweeted QUOTE, “I just got the e-mail about no service fees if you purchased tickets today...But if you’ve already purchased tickets like I did, can we get the cost of service fees back?”

Another fan wrote QUOTE, “You all should be ashamed and embarrassed over the Verified Fan SCAM you pulled on TS fans for this tour...Months after the ‘verified’ presale better tickets at cheaper prices are being released.”

Alright guys now I wanna hear your thoughts on this -- are you surprised that Taylor hasn’t sold out a single stop on her tour yet, or do you think she will once the tour actually starts and everyone hears how amazing it is? And how do YOU feel about the Swift Tix program, and the no service fees promo? Sound off with all your thoughts and feelings in the comments below, and after that click right over here to check out Taylor’s new country song with Sugarland!

First, we are trying out some Japanese BBQ Yakitori skewers for lunch at a local market, the Ameya Yokocho. Here, you can find all sorts of delicious Japanese street food and seafood! From Sushi to fresh seafood, it's all here!

After this, we found a nice local seafood stall, where you can order raw scallops on the spot! They were super juicy and plump!

After the amazing raw Japanese oysters on the street, we went for a super unique Unagi entire eel bowl over rice, found at Unatoto Eel Restaurant.

After this we went for a nice bowl of beef ramen in Tokyo, it was super rich and smooth!

After this, we went for a classic Japanese food, the Wagyu beef BBQ Yakuniku! It was the best beef I've ever eaten! Found at Sumibi Yakiniku Nakahara.

Even after eating all of these amazing street foods in Tokyo, there is so many more things to eat! You will definitely have to travel here to try them all!

“Descendants 3” is Disney’s one of the most expecting movies ever. We all know it’s coming, but we don’t know who will be in “Descendants 3,” what will the story be about, or when will the movie be released. Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, Sofia Carson, and Booboo Stewart are anxiously waiting to share more news about the third movie, and we’re very excited to hear them. Here’s everything we know about “Descendants 3” so far!

Cameron Boyce actually shared his own dream plot of what could happen in “Descendants 3” and honestly, we think it’s absolutely amazing. On top of that, Kenny Ortega said he wants to get the fan reactions before he starts making the movie, which means we’ll probably get the story most fans want to get! Make sure to join us and come up with some fan theories on what could happen in “Descendants 3”! Don’t forget to subscribe to TheThings on YouTube.

After draining his life savings to enter a team in the Rucker Classic street ball tournament in Harlem, Dax (Lil Rel Howery) is dealt a series of unfortunate setbacks, including losing his team to his longtime rival (Nick Kroll).  Desperate to win the tournament and the cash prize, Dax stumbles upon the man, the myth, the legend UNCLE DREW (NBA All-Star Kyrie Irving) and convinces him to return to the court one more time. The two men embark on a road trip to round up Drew's old basketball squad (Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Nate Robinson, and Lisa Leslie) and prove that a group of septuagenarians can still win the big one.

In my Real Doctor vs. TV Doctor medical drama review video, I promised that if you got that video to 10,000 likes I would record myself reacting to a full grey's anatomy episode. You got it to 20,000 likes! You have spoken and I have listened. You should know that I do get the question a lot from patients as well. Is grey's anatomy accurate? So I finally decided to take a dive and find out!

In this video, I sit down and watch the first ever Grey's Anatomy episode. Basically, a real doctor reacts to greys anatomy! I grew up watching ER and other TV medical dramas so I had a suspicion I would enjoy the show. I have to say this, greys anatomy is not medically accurate but the way it describes the characters as residents is very accurate. The hospital drama is real and I feel the show did a good job highlighting the difficulties of being a resident, inside the hospital and out. The one medical scene which totally threw me is when the surgeons automatically assumed that the seizure patient will need surgery before even coming to a diagnosis. That is not real life medicine.

It surprised me that the show is actually very entertaining and I actually enjoy the drama between McDreamy / Derek Shepherd and Meredith Grey. Apparently, TV doctors do have souls haha. The hospital romance is real!

Get this video to 15k likes If you want me to do another doctor reacts to greys or doctor reacts to the good doctor or any other show. Please comment down below the name of your favorite show and episode. Love you all and appreciate the support!

420 million years ago, a giant feasted on the dead, growing slowly into the largest living thing on land. It belonged to an unlikely group of pioneers that ultimately made life on land possible -- the fungi.

'Fire and Fury' has been published early after president Trump's lawyers threatened to sue. 

There is so much demand for the new book on Donald Trump that stores can't keep up with demand. 

Its publishers had to release it early after the president's lawyers threatened to sue them and the former White House Adviser Steve Bannon. 

The book is written by Michael Wolff and draws a picture of a chaotic first year in office. 

Trump has slammed it as 'phoney' - calling the author 'a loser'. 

But, how will this book impact Trump's presidency and America's foreign policy?

According to the official art book and to some members of team Ico, there was 8 more giants to defeat that were deleted in the final release.
In this video we are going to highlight each one of these unused colossi and know why it didn't make it to the final game.

The spiritual sequel of ICO offered a simple but unique gameplay based only on exploration and a series of epic boss fights.
And that's it, no regular enemies, no npcs,  no side quests, no weapon upgrades, ... no nothing.
It's just you, your faithful companion and a huge empty world inhabited only by some small animals and 16 hidden colossi

This is the January 31, 2018 FULL EPISODE of VICE News Tonight on HBO.

3:41 VICE News watched the State of the Union address with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) who is boycotting the event.

8:11 One of the President’s big policy announcements at The State of the Union was that he’s signed an order to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open.

12:06 In April, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit against neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, claiming he harassed and intimidated a Jewish woman over the internet. Since then, Anglin has been in hiding to avoid getting served with court documents. VICE News traveled to Ohio to meet the man responsible for tracking him down.

20:25 The Berlin Wall was the ultimate symbol of the decades-long Cold War division between the Communist Soviet bloc and the West.

This is the non, or low coverage at most, makeup look I've been wearing for the last fortnight, adapted for filming for YouTube! I've had so so many requests to show you what I've been using on my face, so here it is and I have to say I'm seriously loving it! Low maintenance, easy to apply with your fingers and much better for my skin overall than wearing full glam on a daily basis! Hope you find something you love guys :) ASOS haul coming next week!

The official YouTube channel of multi-platinum rock band Panic! At The Disco. The band consists of Brendon Urie, Dan Pawlovich, Nicole Row, and Mike Naran.

Panic! At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track ""Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.

The Mustang Bullitt's arrival in 2018 is intended to mark the 50th anniversary of the famous Steve McQueen film Bullitt. Under the hood is a retuned version of Ford's 5.0-liter Coyote V8, which is making 475 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. That's enough to help this movie-inspired special edition nudge 163 mph - 8 mph faster than the standard Mustang GT. The only transmission option is a six-speed manual, which is shifted with a slick-looking new cueball gear knob. Brembo brakes with red brake calipers come standard as well.

What really sets the Bullitt apart from your standard GT are the looks. Heavily inspired by the movie car, the Bullitt features a badgeless black grille framed in chrome, 'torque-thrust' 19-inch gloss black wheels and a rear Bullitt badge. It will be available in two colors only: Shadow Black, and Dark Highland Green, the latter of which is the same shade worn by the movie car.

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

14:36 Trying the lamb blood pudding
15:20 Packing the rest up and serving to hungry people on the street

In this satisfying street food video, we're traveling to Oaxaca, Mexico, to taste the world famous Barbacoa Lamb, cooked underground whole and served to us whole!  Mexico is a true MEAT HEAVEN, especially when it comes to juicy, spicy lamb that you can find right on the street!

Barbacoa is a famous Lamb dish found all throughout Mexico, and we were super lucky to watch the cooking process of one of the most famous Mexican cuisines. When we walked up, we saw the whole lamb hanging there ready to butcher and cut into smaller pieces. In Mexico, sometimes goat is used, but the process is always similar. It is cut up and covered in a chili sauce or a garlic salt and then put underground to slowly cook for about 3 hours. This was the best Mexican food I've ever tried!

To start the day off, I first tried a Mexican breakfast, and then met up with my friend Javier who brought me to the famous Barbacoa restaurant to watch the lamb recipe and the entire cooking process. it was the most amazing, satisfying street food to watch cooking!

Here is the address to the two Mexican food places we visited in this street food video:

1) Huge Mexican Breakfast including Eggs and Mole Coloradito @ Comedor Juanita, Tlacolula, Oaxaca, Mexico

2) Whole Lamb Barbacoa @ El Sazonde La Abuela Restaurant in Tlacolula, Oaxaca, Mexico

Disney's A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres March 9!

Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres March 9th!
From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.

While one or two percent of the population enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, millions of Iranians are struggling to make ends meet.
 
In 2017, Iran's government set the poverty line at about $480 a month per household.
 
Thirty-three percent of the population lives below the line, that's more than 24 million people. But it's also a struggle for many living above the line.
 
The median income for an average household is about $885, just $2 more than the minimum they need to get by.
 
That means that for most Iranians there is virtually nothing left to save for the future.
 
Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi spoke to some of Tehran's most vulnerable.

Description: Logan Paul would do anything to get more views on YouTube and this is why he keeps pushing the limits in every video. Either you love the Logang or Team 10, you have already heard about the feud between Logan and his brother Jake Paul, two YouTubers who keep insulting each other in diss tracks and pull pranks on each other. This is why today, we are showing you 10 Times Logan Paul Went Too Far.

The Paul brothers are two YouTubers who love diss tracks. The Logang started it and Team 10 wanted to end this. But Logan Paul went way too far when he released the second verse that wasn’t in the original song because it was way too mean. And we quickly realized why Jake Paul would hate it. His ex, Alissa Violet, was part of the video.

Logan Paul and Jake Paul love to pull pranks on each other but we think that the YouTuber went a little too far this time. With the help of some Team 10 members, the Logang turned Jake’s pool into slime. How is he ever going to clean this up? Make sure you watch this video to hear more about Logan’s crazy pranks. 

Stay tuned to hear more about times when Logan Paul went too far like when he was arrested in Italy, when he lost a part of his body during a stunt, when he hired secret services to arrest his brother, and more. What is the worst thing that you ever did to your sibling? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below.

For the millions who tuned in to watch Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle, it was the chance to witness a real-life fairy tale as it was told. The charming prince defied expectations by wedding the American actress and divorcee, so it's probably not too surprising that some of the most memorable moments of the telecast were completely unscripted. From a few swoon-worthy gestures to some gutting emotional tributes, here are the royal wedding moments no one will forget...

Every two seconds, someone in the world has a stroke. One out of every six people will have a stroke at some point in their lives. Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen and are one of the most common causes of death, and a leading cause of preventable disability. But what causes strokes in the first place? And what can doctors do to treat them? Vaibhav Goswami takes us into the body to find out.

Harry's girl is swamped by loving children after prince's cheeky invite on royal couple's first trip to Wales

Prince Harry's bride-to-be got the seal of approval from a group of schoolchildren who engulfed her into an adoring hug during the couple's first visit to Wales today.

The American princess-to-be arrived in the Welsh capital alongside fiancé Prince Harry to a tumultuous welcome from adoring fans today who showered the couple in hugs, handshakes and kisses.

Miss Markle said she was a 'super lucky woman' as she and Harry put on a touching display of affection while carrying out their third engagement - but apologised for being late after their train from London was delayed.

Meghan-mania saw royal supporters queuing outside Cardiff Castle from 6am waiting in the biting cold for the US-born actress and her besotted prince, with some even managing to steal a hug from her as she arrived.

And playful Harry was overheard praising Welsh singing, telling his fiancée: 'You are only going to hear the best singing in Wales… at the Principality Stadium we have the best singing. People are in tune, which you can't say for most football stadiums.'

Meghan wrapped up against the biting cold in a black coat by Stella McCartney, with a 'mini venice' handbag in forest green by British leather goods company DeMellier worth £295 and trousers by the Welsh fashion house, Hiut Denim.

And she was urged to join a group of party-loving Welsh girls for a wild hen party in Cardiff ahead of their big day in May - which she confessed would be 'a lot of fun'.

The couple toured Cardiff Castle before visiting a local school where Prince Harry was filmed breaking out into dance while Miss Markle played Jenga.

The proud prince also encouraged a group of dancing youngsters to ‘mob’ his bride to be, saying: ‘Let’s all give Meghan a group hug!’

The couple were in the economically-deprived area of Tremorfa, where they visited Star Hub, a community and leisure centre which uses sport to engage young people and aid social development.

Harry and Meghan were particularly keen to see the work of StreetGames, which the prince has worked with previously, which works to make sport accessible to all young people, regardless of their social circumstances.

The couple were met by hoards of screaming crowds - which the Prince shook his head in shock on hearing.

Inside they had a brief private meeting before going into the gym where a group of local schoolgirls from the UsGirls project, set up to encourage women to take part in sport, are on exercise bikes.

‘How long have you been peddling? ‘ Harry asked the girls who had been forced to peddle for several minutes while waiting for their arrival.

‘And yet you are all still smiling,’ said Meghan, who introduced herself to each and every one of them by name.

‘How much better is it to come here each evening instead of sitting at home playing on the Play Station,’ she added.

Afterwards Mary Coffey, 13, from Willow High School said: ‘She was amazing, so easy to talk to. And so beautiful! There was a glow about her. And her teeth! I can’t believe I was talking to someone who lives in Buckingham Palace.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-OxNz80ZIUc/sddefault.jpg,0.012498970430771764,0.0005971501523762457,20.931034482758626,0.0005250803063998024,0.01309612058314801,0.013621200889547814,2018-01-18,22:11:06,Thursday,3,14,61,14,58,90,551,2,115,6,1,8,41,2,2,6.0,8.0,['CUI Tf San @'],"['CUI', 'Tf', 'San', '@']",True,"['cui', 'Tf', 'san', '@']",4,4,9,1,0,1,0,6.605387627039206,4,"['sad', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,3,1,0,0,{'person': 5},5

In this video we're tackling the confusing world of carry-on packing.  What is the true size of a carry-on suitcase? What can you bring on board?  How to pack like a minimalist?  We even do a test-pack to show you what we'd pack on a long term trip.

We are big fans of traveling light with only the essentials to carry around.  Travel doesn't just end at the airport.  Whatever you pack for a trip has to be hauled around in taxis, on the bus, on the train, in and out of hotels and hostels.

With some careful planning, you can have a great trip with small, easy to handle luggage.

A few other reasons why we love carry-on packing is because you can save money by not paying to check a bag, you don't have to wait for your luggage to unload from the plane and waste time at the carousel, and you don't have to worry about losing your luggage or having someone take it by mistake.

Here are a few TSA (Travel Security Administration) websites to help you figure out what you can, and can't bring on board.  It varies by airline and by country.  We chose these links based on the top countries that watch our videos :)

LYRICS

Come on home
And let yourself heal
You could sleep
For a thousand years
I won't let you disappear
Let your heart. beat. here

You've been running far and wide
Doing what you hope is right
Chasing what you feel inside
I will take your path as mine

I feel it in my ribs
Feel it in my soul
The pulse just grows

So loud
And so clear
Let your heart beat here
Let your heart beat here

Winter's come to take me away
I wear my ring to know what's at stake
And when the days work at their own pace
You remain my time and place

I feel it in my ribs
Feel it in my soul
The pulse just grows

So loud
And so clear
Let your heart beat here

So loud
And so clear
Let your heart beat here
Let your heart beat here

We found our way past our
youthful fears
And fought our way through the pain and tears
And we drove our stakes in the place most dear
And let our hearts. beat

I feel it in my ribs
Feel it in my soul
The pulse just grows

So loud
And so clear
Let your heart beat here

So loud
And so clear

These are the things Meghan Markle can’t do and royal family rules to follow and things Meghan Markle can’t do now that she’s married to Prince Harry!


10. Social Media - 

Many of us don’t know how we’d live without our consistent News Feed-scrolling on Facebook, newfound Instagram photography skills, endless Snap Stories, or never-ending Tweets; however, Meghan Markle had to shut down all of her social media accounts. Although most of us are still in the tens or hundreds when it comes to Instagram followers, Markle had nearly two million fans when she had to press the button for permanent deletion. However, her marriage to Prince Harry was well worth it. Plus, to be honest, most of us spend too much time staring at our phones anyway. One thing that was probably more difficult for her to shut down for the unforeseeable future was her blog, The Tig. She used it as a platform to write segments about numerous subjects, including travel, beauty, and other celebs. If you try to view the site now, then you’ll see the heartwarming farewell letter she left for fans of the blog.      

9. Can’t Show Legs -

Now that she and Prince Harry have tied the knot, Markle has to make sure that her clothing choices are well-suited for life as a royal. Most of us are used to wearing shorts, mini skirts, or strappy dresses on a daily basis during the summer; however, Prince Harry’s wife is no longer allowed to show so much skin. Most of her gowns will drop below the knee for now on. Plus, she can’t even reveal the bottom part of her shins without a little cover-up. For all public events, Markle will be seen sporting pantyhose or tights from now on. It’s essential for women of the Royal Family to be conservative and conscious of their apparel at all times to prevent any possible slip-ups and wardrobe malfunctions. Seems like you have to be able to handle the heat to marry into royalty.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Q_cjaTb4uk/sddefault.jpg,0.008754488243697154,0.0013030384927222884,6.718518518518517,0.0008156055750743215,0.010057526736419443,0.010873132311493764,2018-06-10,13:45:01,Sunday,6,12,73,12,40,69,542,1,79,0,0,10,1,4,7,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.295237169010089,1,['scared'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

HOW TO TAKE ONE ITEM OF CLOTHING AND STYLE IT FOR MULTIPLE LOOKS AND OCCASIONS. In this video I take a knit jumper dress from Reiss and I show you 4 very different looks; some are good for days-off, others for going on a date, going to work etc. I hope to inspire you to trying this strategy with items you already have – it’s amazing how you can create looks you love when you start playing around and thinking outside of the box!
I also want to demonstrate how buying quality ""high end High Street"" clothing and mixing it with a few designer accessories can instantly lift the level of the garment itself. Integrating a well fitted coat or blazer, immaculate shoes or even a designer handbag really pulls a look together.

The 4 outfits are all linked to below for items shown etc.

IPHONE X BEST AND WORST FEATURES:
BEST:
-Animoji
-Swipe left or right to switch between apps
-Tap to wake (I didn’t actually know this existed until just now)
-Video custom settings (4k w/ 60fps, etc.)
-OLED display - incredible 2436 x 1125 resolution at 458 ppi across 5.8 inches (better, bigger screen on smaller device)
-Selfie portrait mode aka better front facing camera but overall, despite everyone loving the new camera I’m not impressed

WORST:
-FaceID (it’s harder and more annoying you have to be looking straight at the camera, sometimes in hats and glasses it doesn’t work for me), it’s easier to use a finger versus face
-Loss of TouchID (The verdict’s still out on whether Face ID will seamlessly work for users of all colors and ethnicities too)
-Hard to use one handed because of new user interface (swiping from every corner)
-Not impressed with the camera - portrait mode... (it tells me to move closer, then farther, and misses parts of the subject.
-Studio Mode - looks like bad photoshop
-Closing apps is way more annoying and takes more steps. Back to old school iPhone 4
-Apps aren’t fully updated to this size (I’m sure that will change but it’s still annoying)

*******************************

Short History of SACCONEJOLYs

In 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.

In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS

this channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs

When Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.

They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.

They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.

However, there are some things that parents do every day that can pretty serious psychological damage not only to their kids but to themselves as well. Avoid these everyday habits that seem normal but in fact are very dangerous to give your kid the best upbringing and be a perfect parent.
A study at the University of Mary Washington has shown that this constant rush often has negative outcomes for mental health, including anxiety and depression. So delegate what errands you can to someone else or postpone them till the weekend when you can leave the kids with their grandparents or a baby-sitter. 
Children often refuse to eat what’s been given to them when they see their parents hurriedly eating unhealthy snacks instead of a proper meal. 
Find a good activity for your kids during your phone conversations, whether it be a box of crayons, some puzzles, or a book. Warn them before you get on the phone that you’ll be unavailable for a certain amount of time and stick to your word.
Instead of screaming at your kid over something as petty as a lost or broken toy, help them find or fix it. If they’re struggling in school, sit down and work together on improving those grades.
Compassion works much better than comparison. So praise your kids’ strengths, tell them you’ll be there for them no matter what, and set realistic goals together.

SUMMARY
-Hurried panic isn’t just reserved for parents, it also gets passed on to the kids, and nobody needs that kind of negativity in their life no matter what their age.
-Your child won’t ever throw tantrums over healthy food if the whole family gathers at the table and it’s not only the child who’s getting the vitamins. 
-If you don’t want your kid bothering you when you have an important call, explain to them, why you’ll no longer react to them during this time so that the sudden change doesn’t confuse them.
-Let your kids mess up a bit and help them understand what they can do to fix what they’ve done and avoid those mistakes next time.
-If you constantly call yourself fat or ugly or stupid or whatever bad names you tend to assign yourself, your child will think that this sort of self-loathing is totally normal and okay.      
-Comparing your kid to their siblings, peers, or even themselves in the past suppresses their talents, distances them from you, and lowers their self-esteem.
-Teach your kids to always tell the truth and not to put everyone else before themselves.
-Remember, everything you do sets an example for your kids. This also has to do with how much attention you and your kids pay to each other.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Sabuea6byc/sddefault.jpg,0.022916333597170203,0.0003710476025870416,61.76116874867669,0.0005925134488061545,0.023287381199757245,0.0238798946485634,2017-12-15,09:35:01,Friday,4,8,38,8,33,52,334,0,79,0,1,8,14,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.248818930517005,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

I had a blast at CES 2018. I checked out the new Nikon 180-400mm and even had a ride in a self driving car. These are all the things I got up to. 

- Hands on with the Nikon Nikon 180-400mm review.
- Shooting dancers  with the Sony A9 focussing system, its AMAZING.
- Canon created the most boring event space at CES.
- Polaroid was fun awesome and the OneStep 2 is a definite buy.
- LG TV's are incredible.
- Samsung Wall looks great but I wasn't allowed to film, weird. 
- Nikon had robots.... they were amazing
- TVs that actually look like photo frames. Thank you Frame TV
- Lots of techie cars. but they had a Jeep Wrangler 2018 so that made me happy.

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

Here are the top 10 differences between “The Maze Runner” books and movies. For this list, we're looking at plot points and characters that were changed for the screen adaptations of the first two installments, “The Maze Runner” and “The Scorch Trials”. We’ve included moments like how in the movie there’s actually more Teresa! In the books, cranks are infected human that only gradually slide into insanity. In the movie, they opt for a simpler approach, portraying Cranks as straight up zombies whose weird growths and clicking groans sometimes seem remarkably familiar!

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kylie Jenner recently hired four new nannies to help her out with  her new baby, Stormi. She was not all for getting a nanny when her new baby had just arrived, but she seems to have had a change of heart. The 20-year old new mom is a little more overwhelmed with the adjustment into motherhood than she thought she would be. Despite having the full support of her mother and sisters everyone has a lot on their plates,  leading Kylie to get some extra hands on deck. Working for the Kardashian-Jenner family is no small feat, and being a nanny for the family is no exception. The stress of wanting to keep her baby out of harm's way and the pressure of constantly being in the spotlight means Kylie Jenner has some strict rules for her new nannies to follow. From knowing where to stand to maintaining a vegan household, joining the Kardashian-Jenner staff entourage is a full-time job with many guidelines that reflect the reality star’s brand.

He’s been doing sketch comedy for most of his life – starting as a child star on Nickelodeon’s All That and Kenan and Kel, and is now the longest-running cast member on Saturday Night Live, clocking in at 15 seasons and counting.

During a segment on VICE News Tonight, Kenan Thompson (and rookie writer Sam Jay) talked about the challenge of making jokes that both appeal to a diversifying America, but also keep the traditional SNL audience laughing.

But we wanted to hear more. 

So in this extended interview, Kenan looks back at his career thus far, talking about his feelings of self-doubt when he first joined the show, whether or not it’s time to move on from SNL, and what it would take to revive his infamous “What Up With That” sketch.

Lyrics:

I wanna hate you cause I still love you 
And it’s weighing on my chest
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what’s coming next

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
but I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there’s no good way
Yeah there’s no good way

I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
You got that something that i never want to lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, ohhh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

I wanna feel you
Really feel you
Not just hold you close at night 
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's on our minds

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
but I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good, yeah there's no good way

I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
You got that something that i never want to lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song’s already over
Moving without getting any closer, ohhh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
but I couldn't bring myself to bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home
even if I go, even if I stay

I'm chasing fire when I am running after you
You got that something that I never want to lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer
I'm chasing fire when I am running after you

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way

Keep chasing fire
No other way
No other way",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_cjXhUOGJM/sddefault.jpg,0.009851422719902908,0.00019052167976713096,51.70762052877138,0.00017333620943043795,0.01004194439967004,0.010215280609100477,2018-04-18,04:00:01,Wednesday,2,9,15,9,15,57,90,5,20,0,2,8,14,0,4,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.648722629882286,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'car': 1},1

Hi big hurc recent fan idk if you’ve done a video on this but As a white guy with a black fiancé would I get treated differently by my own race and if so would it be best to try and keep it down low or does it only matter in prison. Thanks fan from Canada 

Question 2:

Hey Man

Big fan of the show, I’m a Samoan based here in Spain.
Just wanted to know where the Samoans fit in the prison systems and who they hang with?
Also, which race groups are allies in prison if things got serious?

Tune in to find out what Big Herc has to say about this!

Lyrics:
You sit there with that look on your face like you won
Like nothing that I say is gonna change how you feel now
You sit there and you tell me you fell outta love
And we are in your way so you just gotta leave now
And we just need to understand your reasons
And you are gonna justify this treason
By telling me the promises that we sworn ain't enough

So now you gonna be another person?
And how do I explain this shit to our son?
How'd you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?
Daddy's gone

Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

You sit there with your phone in your hands and you're hurt
You tell me that you feel like you lost me when he came
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours but it is his name
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her with her own one
And you want me to tell me that what you've done is okay

So now you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And you'd tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed

Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

Let's talk about family
Let's talk about family
Let's talk of the ties and the lies
And the love that we had in this family
Let's talk about honesty
You know nothing about honesty
I'll let go of your hands and our plans
And the chance that we had with this family

Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
Oh na na, we'll leave you alone

Lyrics:
There was a lonely guy named Robert 
Who was feeling kinda down
So he got himself a beer and he sat there with a frown 
His girlfriend just broke up with him that day 
So things were not okay
So he got himself a lift without any hesitation
Driver said “Where are you going”
I don’t have a destination
He said “I know a nice bar that has great booze”
Well I have nothing to lose
So he got out of the car and made his way inside the bar
The driver out the window yelled 
“Please give me 5 stars”
He then sat to get a drink
From the bartender by the sink
That’s when he saw the very thing
That changed his whole reality
And ooooh
It was the prettiest face in the world
She was unlike any other girl
She smiled and her teeth were white as pearls
Oh yeah, like any other girl
So he got up from his seat
‘cause his heart had skipped a beat
It was time to change his day
He knew just the thing to say
He said “hey”
She said “Hey”
He said “Hey”
He said “Sorry to interrupt”
Robert walked back to his seat
As he accepted his defeat
Then he finished up his beer
As he lost all of his cheer
Then he felt a hand upon his shoulder
As the air grew even colder
She said before he drank another
Sorry about what happened with my brother
I thought that was your man
It’s just my brother Dan
Hey Dan
Hey man
So he got right up off of his chair
And ran his fingers through her hair and
There was a lonely guy named Robert who was feeling kinda down
so he got himself a beer and he sat there with a frown 
his girlfriend just broke up with him that day 
but things will be okay

By the primitive technology we have filtered clean water from the tank, initially we make charcoal then go to streams for sand and stones. Charcoal can eliminate toxins and bacteria, rocks and sand that cleanse water. We let the charcoal make the first layer followed by stone and sand, large stones at the top. It takes 1 hour for water to be purified. We will continue to make the next video on primitive technology and wild survival skills. Subscribe to the channel to watch the latest videos. Thank you.

This is the best place to stop if you want to try delicious Tokyo Street Food!

We're starting out with our first Japanese street food by trying a nice Uni Ikura Don also known as sea urchin and salmon roe bowl. This is the perfect street food to try in Japan in the morning for breakfast! You can also eat amazing fresh sashimi in this sushi restaurant, but I preferred the bowl of salmon roe and sea urchin.

After this, we found the most INSANE Sashimi stall, serving up fresh tuna sashimi by the cube, sliced right in front of you! It doesn't get any better than this! It is served to you with a little soy and wasabi, absolutely perfect!

After the amazing tuna sashimi, we went deeper into the Tsukiji market to find some other Japanese street food, and found a stall selling more raw Japanese seafood, and decided to try the raw scallops. They were super tasty!

After this we found a stall selling a dish known as Kuromon don, a rich beef offal stew over top of rice and topped with green onions. It was very delicious and super fun to enjoy right on the street! You just pull up a chair and sit down on the counter and watch them scoop up this delicious Japanese street food right before your eyes!

After this, we went for a famous bowl of ramen noodles in Japan, at Ichiran ramen. It is a Tonkatsu style broth, so quite creamy and rich, and the best part is how you can customize it exactly how you want it, with different levels of spiciness and richness, all from a machine!

After this amazing ramen, we went for a once in a lifetime Sushi experience at Nishi-azabu Kamikura. It wasn't cheap, but it was an amazing experience that you will always remember. The master chef cuts each piece of raw fish for you and creates Sushi for you individually and serves it to you by hand. It's unforgettable and you can taste new flavours and textures with each piece.

This is an Easy DIY knife making project the  blade etching techniques can also be used on a variety of other knife making projects.

Adventure travel, backpacking, and traveling around the world for street food is what we live to do. We don't always publish daily vlogs because it takes a few days to collect enough footage to create a travel and food video. In each destination that we go to, we try and map out the top street food tips for you, so that when you go, you can follow our street food tour videos and not have to take a tour guide. Exploring for street food is the best way to travel, and we are both so lucky to be able to get paid to travel by making youtube videos. These videos are kind of like our street food travel diary, you can follow along and enjoy the delicious food of the world. Affordable travel really is the way to go!

Here is the restaurant name for the food we ate: 东北大淋手工饺子

In her class, Helen Mirren discusses the dualism that is core to her acting method: the necessity for mastering technique (craft), and then letting go of that technique so that your imagination can take over (art). Lessons include how to break down a script, conduct research for real and fictional characters, approach the more “poetic” aspects of character, make thoughtful decisions on your costume, and handle props in a way that is true to your character.

While helping you develop your own acting talent, Helen takes you behind the scenes of her greatest roles, including Elizabeth II in The Queen, Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect, and Prospero in The Tempest.

In her MasterClass, Helen teaches you:
• Researching Characters
• Breaking Down Scripts
• Creating Characters Through Hair and Makeup
• Creating Characters Through Costume
• Characterizing Sets
• Camera Technique
• Performing Shakespeare
• Collaborating With Writers & Directors

Ever wondered which are the tallest giant in WWE, WWF, and WCW wrestling history?

Let us know in the comments below if we forgot anybody!

***TOP 13 SPOILERS***

#13. Big Cass:
Standing 7' and still recovering from an ACL knee injury, William Morrissey seems to have a bright future in the WWE as one of its biggest stars in recent years.
#12. The Big Show:
Standing 7 feet, Paul Wight was originally hinted at being Andre the Giant’s son until disgusted wrestling fans forced WCW to disavow the claim. Still, the big man proved an immediate sensation in WCW, winning its world championship and going on to a long run in the WWE as “The Big Show.”

#11. Uncle Elmer:
Longtime regional star Stanley Frazier used his height of 7 feet to make himself into a star in wrestling’s southern territories, including a long tenure in Memphis Wrestling. Frazier achieved national fame late in his career as Uncle Elmer, one of Hillbilly Jim’s seemingly endless number of wrestling relatives.

#10. Kane:
Standing 7 feet, college hoops player Glen Jacobs found success in the WWF as “The Big Red Machine,” breaking through into the main event as the Undertaker brother, Kane. Jacobs debuted at 1997’s Badd Blood: In Your House pay-per-view, attacking his storyline brother during the Undertaker’s Hell in a Cell bout against Shawn Michaels. Jacobs’ run as Kane was an immediate success, obliterating the bad memories of past runs in the WWF as evil dentist Isaac Yankem and the faux Diesel.

#9. Andre the Giant:
After some research, it looks like Andre was standing around 7 feet. While you may disagree with us and point to the many claims that Andre stood 7’4” (or even 7’5”), it’s hard to argue with the photographic evidence. Consider this—“The Eighth Wonder of the World” was seen in a photograph standing next to 7’1” basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain, with little size difference between the two.

#8. The Great Khali:
Standing 7’1,” the Great Khali got a push in the WWE to match his size, even though his in-ring ability left much to be desired. Wrestling is about more than hiplocks and armdrags though, and Khali served the role of a monster heel during his early run in the WWE. Khali made a surprise appearance at 2017’s WWE Battleground, helping then WWE Champion Jinder Mahal retain his championship against Randy Orton in a Punjabi Prison Match.

#7. Raja Lion:
This 7’2” giant from Pakistan may be more deserving of an honorable mention than inclusion on our list as he’s believed to have had the proverbial cup of coffee in the squared circle, with his best-known match being against Japan’s “Giant” Baba.

#6. Giant Silva:
Standing 7’2”, like many of the giants on our list Paulo César da Silva played basketball before wrestling, in his case competing at the 1988 Summer Olympics for Brazil. Silva was a member of the Attitude Era’s bizarre faction “The Oddities,” performing alongside Kurrgan and Golga.

#5. Ron Reis:
Although the name Ron Reis may not ring a bell, fans who watched (some would say endured) Hulk Hogan’s WCW battle with the Dungeon of Doom will likely recall Reis’ brief turn as the 7’2” Yeti, the heavily bandaged giant who terrorized Hogan briefly to end Hulkamania at 1995’s Halloween Havoc pay-per-view. Reis also performed as Super Giant Ninja, Big Ron Studd and Reese.

#4. Kurt Zehe:
Not much is known about German wrestler Kurt Zehe other than he worked in the United Kingdom after World War Two as the aptly-named Gargantua. Footage exists of Zehe wrestling, with his height listed at an incredible 8’4” but his actual height being ""just"" 7’2”.

#3. Silo Sam:
John Harris worked in World Class Championship Wrestling, the American Wrestling Association, and the WWF, but never found lasting success in any of the promotions despite his tall stature. In true wrestling tradition, Harris’ height was billed at a hyped 7’7”, but 7’3” to 7’5” is believed to be his true height.

#2. Paul Bunyan:
Standing 7’7”, folklore fans may be familiar with American folk hero Paul Bunyan, the giant lumberjack who became the subject of many tall tales in the United States. Chances are, wrestling fans haven’t heard of wrestling’s Paul Bunyan, a basketball player and occasional actor who wrestled briefly around the 1950’s.

#1. Giant Gonzales:
There are many big men on our list, but no one as big as Jorge Gonzalez, who played basketball for the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks until a knee injury ended his career. Hawks’ owner and WCW owner Ted Turner offered Gonzales a gig at WCW where the big man performed under the name El Gigante (aka “The Giant”)

From Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television, A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE! is inspired by the holiday classic feature “A Christmas Story” and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway production “A Christmas Story: The Musical.” Marc Platt (“Grease: Live,” “La La Land,” “Wicked”) and Adam Siegel (“Grease: Live”) will executive-produce, with Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary (“Grease: Live,” “Anything but Love,” “Ira & Abby”) serving as co-executive producers and writers. Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “La La Land”) who composed the original score to “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” will compose several new songs for the LIVE television event airing Sunday, Dec. 17 (7:00-10:00 PM ET live/PT tape-delayed) on FOX.

Two-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick (“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “The Producers,” “Manchester by the Sea”) will star as the narrator where he will play the grown-up “Ralphie Parker,” who looks back with love and humor on his favorite childhood Christmas. Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker."" Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.

Lyrics: 
everything you wanted in your life
has happened to you now
but you're standing in the courtyard
mourning new lost friends
who's lives were cut short before the summers end.

and the boy you want so bad
is sitting courtside with miss everything you hate
and it shapes the way you look at men
and you're bothered by the weight of having to pretend
that its still summer
but its not summer

18 years
chained to my fears
in too deep/ losing sleep
tragedies reminding me of why Im losing sleep I'm in to deep
i give up
are you up?
talk to me
are you up?
i give up
talk to me

every boy you seem to trust
loves to let you down
they're always standing on the edge of what makes sense
like he's trying to focus frame with a dirty lens

and the girls will never let you live it down
the way you give it up
so you fill your time with chemicals
and you knew his skin was hardly memorable

not like the summer
not like this summer

18 years
chained to my fears
in too deep/ out of reach
tragedies reminding me of why I’m losing sleep I'm in to deep
i give up
are you up?
talk to me
are you up?
i give up
talk to me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iFZc0IQkYY/sddefault.jpg,0.010765090349865437,0.0003417488999957281,31.5,0.0008116536374898544,0.011106839249861163,0.011918492887351018,2018-04-27,04:03:09,Friday,4,8,49,8,36,42,307,3,59,1,0,5,9,0,7,4.0,5.0,['ee'],['ee'],True,['ee'],1,1,2,0,0,0,0,6.249585336897668,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Black Hole Swarms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVhtKAnp3G4


For the sake of argument, let’s say that humanity survives the several ends of the world that await us.  We somehow persist the gradual heating of our Sun and the evaporation of our oceans. Our descendants cling to existence through countless generations we watch the Andromeda galaxy merge with the Milky Way, forming a vast elliptical galaxy. We seek refuge in the outer solar system as the Sun finally expands into a red giant – twice! And finally our heirs or successors find new homes among the stars after the Sun’s final death and transformation into a dim white dwarf.

Lyrics:
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

The new 7.5FK Field Pistol from BRNO is one amazing new concept both in the design of the pistol and in the 7.5FK cartridge itself. The Field Pistol is designed to be a military offensive and defensive firearm. The 7.5 FK BRNO Field Pistol is capable of incredible power, which we showcase in this video. The 7.5FK Field Pistol should also make for an outstanding hunting handgun.

Deadpool 2 is finally here, and with it comes more Easter eggs than an industrial hatchery. It's no surprise that Wade Wilson would keep the pop culture references coming fast and furious, but Deadpool 2 also came with a pretty wide assortment of secrets that you'd have to dig pretty far into your comic archives to find. Gird your loins and prepare yourself for spoilers: like a stolen prison pen, we're going deep…

Aspiring Olympic diver Garrett Delaney was born to compete on the world stage, and his mom Tracy has been training him for it his entire life. 

But a near-death accident in practice shakes his faith in that dream. With Olympic trials only two weeks away, he fears he must make a decision: give up or die trying.

""Blood and Water"" boasts stellar production values, sharp camerawork and a charismatic lead screen presence by bona-fide 2016 Olympic silver medalist Steele Johnson, lending the film a degree of gritty authenticity and impressiveness.

The story is inspired by director Brian Blum's own experience as a competitive diver. After his head collided with a springboard during a routine dive, he took three years to recover psychologically from the accident.

His experience lends the storytelling a degree of emotional specificity, transforming the typical comeback story into a riveting portrait of courage and resilience.

I have always believed that people in their ugliest, most hateful states have all been wounded in some way, at some point in their lives. I wanted to portray the common threads in humanity: We all feel pain. We all believe in something...and that more than ever, we should be coming together to lift one another up, not tearing each other down. It’s about the beauty of people coming together regardless of their differences.

This song was written with good friends Lauren (aka Fleurie) and Matt Bronleewe (who also produced “I Get to Love You”). Lauren
and I both knew after hearing the final version of the song that we had to create something visual for it, and I just couldn’t get Iceland out of my head. It had been a dream of mine to shoot there, and I knew that this was the perfect song for it. I wanted it to feel more cinematic and scenic in nature than like a music video. I organized a crew, and we flew to a very remote area near Vík, Iceland. We shot the video within a few days. It was freezing cold, but worth every minute. It was certainly an adventure I will never forget.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series 'Tell My Story.'

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to guess their blind date partner's interests and past experiences based only on their partner's appearance. When they learned their partner's real answers, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now tell YOUR story. What do people assume about you?

As the service at the West London Crematorium came to a close The Skatalites' 1967 ska song 'Christine Keeler' was played.Keeler was thrust into the spotlight after enjoying a secret romance with Cabinet minister John Profumo in 1961 at the height of the Cold War.Scandal engulfed the Establishment after later it emerged that the then 19-year-old Keeler had also been sleeping with Eugene Ivanov, a Soviet naval attaché at the Russian Embassy in London.It nearly toppled the Conservative government, resulting in the resignation of Profumo as well as a series of criminal trials.Keeler lived as a recluse under the name Sloane in the years following the scandal - breaking cover only a few times to talk about the affair.She was briefly married twice - with both ending in divorce - and had two sons as well as a granddaughter.She was cremated under the name Christine Margaret Sloane.'The ceremony reflected what Christine had sought for so long, in that it was a warm, loving and, most importantly, a gentle farewell,' her friend Douglas Thompson told the Telegraph.'She had a tough life and survived an emotional battering over the years.Her funeral was the antithesis of that.' The Profumo affair had it all - sex, lies and espionage.It broke at the height of the Cold War, when spying was rife and the threat of war was imminent with the outbreak of the Cuban Missile Crisis.Here we look back at how the scandal unfolded: April 1960: At the height of the Cold War, Christine Keeler, having left her home in Wraysbury, Berks, heads for London and begins working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Soho.It is there that she meets Dr Stephen Ward, a London osteopath.Within weeks she had moved into his Bayswater flat.She soon meets Mandy Rice-Davies at Murray's and the pair become party companions.July 1961: Ward introduces 19-year-old Keeler to Secretary of State for War, John Profumo, while at a party thrown by Lord and Lady Astor at their stately home in Cliveden at Taplow, Bucks.Keeler and Profumo embark on an affair lasting only a few weeks.At the same time, she becomes involved in an affair with Commander Eugene Ivanov, a Soviet naval attaché at the Russian Embassy in L",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tODbJTHeDw/hqdefault.jpg,0.0052421023589460615,0.0006897503103876398,7.6,0.0009656504345426957,0.005931852669333701,0.006897503103876396,2017-12-17,17:12:05,Sunday,6,9,13,9,13,54,120,2,40,0,0,3,0,2,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0927071308799645,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'horse': 1, 'person': 1}",2

With STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI on the horizon, I have entered full Star Wars hype mode! And with that comes over-analyzing  everything we've seen in the newest trailer and the previous movies - leading me to one question: Who is Rey? More specifically, who are Rey's parents?

And it isn't just a modern problem, either. Marketing companies have been putting major spoilers in trailers for years. Let's take a look at some trailers that totally ruined the movie.

Help us document and support the new faces of homelessness and those at need in an effort to shed more light and awareness on this growing issue.  https://www.gofundme.com/tent-city-angels

""Tent cities"" are popping up all over America at rapid speeds (The National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty announced that research showed a 1,342% increase in homeless encampments reported between 2007 and 2017). 

I and my producing partner Mitch Koss got to check out the controversial Los Angeles Angel's Tent City located in Anaheim, California where more than 1,000 people are said to call this area ""home."" Within minutes, we met a 34 year old college educated single Mom born and raised in Orange County, aka ""The OC"", who is now 6 months in to living in her tent. She let us film inside her tent so we could show you this dangerous living environment. Also, I get tempted to buy a bicycle from ""Mike's Bikes"", another locally born and raised OC native millennial now 3 years into living in tent city. He lives in a sub camp with his brother a contractor short on jobs and his fiancee who works full time in a local store. 

Perhaps the reason why California, New York, Florida and Washington state account for so many homeless people is that homelessness is no longer simply the result of mental illness and / or addiction -- which it mainly was starting in the '80s when the mental ill were ""de-institutionalized,"" that is, tossed onto the streets, so the public didn't have to pay for their care. 

Today homelessness is looking more and more like the result of income inequality, and the rising unaffordability it brings. 

For example, the state of California has the world's 6th largest economy, which means there's a lot of accumulated wealth here. But last fall, the US Census Bureau said that when cost-of-living is factored in, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation, nearly 1 in 5 people... And nearly 1 in 8 residents of the US living in California: https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/09/12/75575/california-s-housing-costs-are-driving-its-no-1-po/

Your financial support is SO APPRECIATED.  My vision is to give these forgotten / ignored neighbors a voice, a platform, and an opportunity to succeed.   

PLEASE SHARE.

THANK YOU.

So this video has been requested a bunch of times after I showed my smores paper squishy in my collection video!

So i decided to remake one for you today so you could see how to make this cute little paper squishy!

I kept this video ""real-time"", so i didn't speed up any of it, or slow any of it down or anything like that so you can see how long it did take me to make this! :D

I hope you like it!

If you want to see more of the paper squishies please give it a like as the likes really help me to gage what type of video to post and what you'd like to see more of!!

If you have any questions please leave them in the comments below and ill try to answer them!!

At first this storm seemed like the typical storm complex that develops in Nebraska in June.  Shooting time-lapse photography on the north side of the storm gave me clear view of the multi celled updrafts. With each passing minute, more and more lightning activity became visible.  It soon become evident Mother Nature was cooking up something unusual.

Throughout the video you'll notice little green lights glowing. These are fireflies and they were also unusually abundant this year.

OFF THE TOP - Black Panther Editor reveals 2 deleted scenes

PATREON Supporter John DiNicola - A while back, you said John Krasinksi was poised for the A-list but the failure of his 2008 film, Leatherheads, derailed that. However, with glowing reactions coming out of SXSW for both directing/starring in A Quiet Place, and his Amazon series, Jack Ryan, hitting this summer, do you think he’s on the way up again? Thanks, and keep up the great work.

Jammie Roussel - Hey John. I was reading that there was a test screening of Deadpool 2 that the audience hated which caused them to go for re-shoots. But now I’m reading that Josh Brolin is saying they’re doing reshoots to add more humor based on the new Marvel movies. Which is true?

Tiago Pereira- Greetings from Portugal. My question is: What is happening with the batman movie? Matt Reeves was announced a year ago to be the director and we literally don't even know who's going to play batman or when the movie is coming out. What are your thoughts on the batman movie current situation?

A superhero? Great. But can you pull it off? Well, according to the stars of Marvel’s Black Panther, most of your costume attempts need a serious rethink...
 
We gave Chadwick Boseman (T’Challa, The Black Panther) and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger) an iPad riddled with photos of LADbible readers’ shoddy superhero costumes.
 
From Spiderman ballerinas to Marijuana Girl, to classics such as Superman, the pair lay down some vicious opinions on your makeshift attires. And practically laugh their heads off in the process.
 
Take both a hero and villain’s advice: sometimes, a Photoshop job is the best tactic.

Lyrics

[Chorus]
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life
[Chorus]
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

PRISTIN, the Rookie of the Year award winner of all kinds of awards ceremony in 2017 as the new girls group who drew the most attention, formed unit PRISTIN V for the first time in its debut. The new unit group heralded its remarkable formation with different charms. Title track ‘Get It’ has an impressive message of freedom and honesty to take what you want to get without hesitation. It is a ratchet based R&B pop song that PRISTINE has never tried before and you can expect the different moods and performances of PRISTINE V in this song.

Back with another swatch video! I've realized that these are everyone's favorites from me, so I figured I'd pick up some of the Colourpop MATTE Lux Lipsticks and share with you my thoughts, the swatches and my favorites.

TIME:
1:20 Swatches begin
3:13 Review: wear, shades, pros/cons
5:48 Favorite lipsticks RANKED 1-8

Bottom line: I think that these are great! They're soft, they DON'T accentuate any lines on my lips (at least with initial application) and some of the brighter shades stained my lips, so that was an indication to me that they'd wear for a long time. I think the shades I picked up are perfect for a medium skin tone and for $7 each, they're definitely worth it. My only con was the name stickers on the bottom. I prefer the finished look of the color sticker with the name & type of finish. But I also hope they get more accurate swatch representation of the shades. Other than that, I'm looking forward to them expanding the collection!

───────────── ♪ Lyrics ♪  ─────────────
[Verse 1]
It never fades away, it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice, left in silence

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
Reminding me, I got these scars, get your love
Keep reminding me, ooh, to forget your love

[Chorus]
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark (understand)

You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark (understand)

[Verse 2]
There's no room in war for feelings
Hurt me to the core, still healing
And I know you're no good for me
So I try to forget the memories

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget

[Chorus]
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark (understand)

[Bridge]
Remember I told you
To save it, it's over
And I'll be alright
So hurt me as much as you like
I need you to let go
I got these mementos
And I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget

[Chorus 2]
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget

It's the kind of perfectly-proportioned, well-balanced wristwatch you expect from a 136-year-old company, with a stock watchface modeled on a design that first saw the light of day in 1946. Even the band, made of a humble soft silicone, manages to come off as somehow fancier than it really is. 

Yes, everything about the Movado Connect oozes sleek sophistication ... which is why it's going to break my heart to return it, as I'll probably end up doing. Find out why in MrMobile's Movado Connect First Look – and let me know whether you'd keep it or toss it back, in the comments below!

The London Chess Classic is a 10-player round-robin taking place from December 1st to 11th at Google HQ in London, for Round 1, and then at the Olympia Conference Centre in Kensington. The event is the 5th and final leg of the Grand Chess Tour and features World Champion Magnus Carlsen, other tour regulars Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura, Wesley So, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Sergey Karjakin, as well as English wild card Mickey Adams.

The prize fund is $300,000 (about €280,000) with a first prize of $75,000, plus another $100,000 and $50,000 respectively for the top two in the overall 2017 Grand Chess Tour standings. Players receive 100 minutes for 40 moves then 60 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second delay from move 1. In the event of a tie for first, a tiebreak match (10 mins + 5 seconds delay) will be played, beginning 30 minutes after the end of the last classical game. If still tied, up to 2 mini matches (5 min, 3-sec delay) will follow and finally an Armageddon game (5 min vs. 4 min). Official websites: www.londonchessclassic.com | grandchesstour.org

Check out all the highlights from Seth Meyer’s opening Golden Globes monolouge, right here on News Feed!

This episode is brought to you by Turbo Tax. Relax, there’s Turbo Tax.

Seth Meyers killed his opening monologue, thanks to some help with his punchlines from a few famous audience members….

Seth Meyers did not hold back when it came to his opening monologue at tonight’s Golden Globes, as the recent sexual harassment allegations across Hollywood and the #MeToo movement took front and center of his intro to the awards show. He started off the night saying QUOTE, “It’s 2018 and marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn’t...It’s been years since a white man has been this nervous in Hollywood.""

When it came to mentioning what Seth called the elephant NOT in the room, aka Harvey Weinstein, Seth joked, “Harvey Weinstein is not here tonight. Don’t worry he’ll back back in 20 years when he’s the first person booed in the In Memoriam.”

Things definitely took a lighter turn when Seth joked about Meryl Streep and Steven Spielberg being nominated for The Post

One part of Seth’s monologue that also received a ton of laughs was his ""Jokes Seth Can't Tell” segment, in which he provided the set-up to a few jokes that stars in the audience then gave the punchline for.

I’m officially casting my vote for Amy Poehler to host literally everything next year.

Seth rounded out the monologue by acknowledging and congratulating all the amazing female nominees in the room, adding QUOTE, “I look forward to you leading us into whatever comes next.” Now that’s a statement we can all get behind.

So what did you guys think of Seth’s opening monologue? Which jokes were your favorite, and which ones just didn't land for you?

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

Devon Stephenson - I’m a HUGE fan of Chris Hemsworth. Loved him in Rush and obviously the Thor movies. I’ve been seeing on twitter that he’s going to join the cast of Men In Black relaunch. Is this true? Is it a good move? Is he just looking for another franchise? Maybe it’s a wonderful move. I’m so confused. What do you think?

Marianne Stillweather -  Greetings and salutations John. Big fan from Boston! Wonder Woman was obviously a game changer for the superhero genre so I’m so excited for Wonder Woman 2. I read today that Kristen Wiig is going to be the bad guy in the sequel Cheetah. Don’t get me wrong, I like Wiig a lot. I love bridesmaids!) but I have a hard time seeing her in an action role. Would this be a good fit for her?

Anuet B - Hi John. Viewer from London here! With all the mergers and sales going on do you think that Warner Bros could actually go up for sale like the news stories are talking about? If WB goes on the block, who are some likely buyers? Could we see Disney scoop them up and control both Marvel AND DC properties? Thanks and keep up the filthy!

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm only alive when I'm in your world
(Only alive in your world)
Well then how do I live without being your girl?
(You make this world feel like)

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I a fool?
(A fool, a fool fro you)
Falling for you
(Falling, falling for you)

[Chorus]
I just wanna fall, I just wanna fall
And please let me fall, please let me fall
Out of love with you
(Out of love with you)
Out of love with you
(Out of love with you)

[Verse 2]
I'm black-eyed and blue drinking strawberry wine
(Drunk on that strawberry wine)
I carved out my heart, tried to leave you this time
(Try and I try to leave you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I a fool?
(A fool, a fool fro you)
Falling for you
(Falling, falling for you)
(Every time)

[Chorus]
I just wanna fall, I just wanna fall
And please let me fall, please let me fall
Out of love with you
(Out of love with you)
Out of love with you
(Out of love with you)

[Chorus]
I just wanna fall, I just wanna fall
And please let me fall, please let me fall
Out of love with you
(Out of love with you)
Out of love with you
(Out of love with you)

Korth is a boutique firearms manufacturer in Germany generally known for their very fine and very expensive revolvers. In 2015, they decided to introduce an automatic pistol as well, which they called the PRS. It is a combination of a 1911 frame and a roller-delayed, fixed barrel slide assembly. As one would expect from their revolvers, the fit and finish quality is magnificent…and the price reflects that.

You can use it almost as an intercom system since it connects instantly, and the Echo Show actually uses motion sensors to determine if anyone is even there on the other end before you make the call.

You can use it from Echo to Echo or just by using the Amazon Alexa app on your phone (you can only to outbound video from the app though) and to avoid privacy issues there are options for who and when people can use it if you only want your own devices capable of doing it 

So in this video, I'll walk you through how to use drop in on the Amazon Echo devices.

Black eyeshadow, way too dark foundation...it was a mess, but I loved it. And I hope you love it too lol.

It's PRIME TIME. AMAZON PRIME TIME. Amazon is well known for being a great service to obtain items in a quick and timely manner. With this new show not only do we put that to the test, but we venture into what Amazon is all about, the weird shit.

The rules are simple, using our collective funds we buy a few items  for each other and not knowing what they are, we share them with one another on the couch. We could very well go poor doing this, we just want you to know this.

The following is for those multicultural.

Dies führt zu einem ovalen Ring um jeden Magnetpol, an dem Auroras auftreten. Die Nordpolaurora heißt Aurora borealis und die Aurora am Südpol heißt Aurora australis. Abhängig von der Höhe der Sonnenaktivität in der letzten Zeit kann die Auroraktivität um den Ring sichtbar sein oder auch nicht.

INGREDIENTS:
Ingredients:
1 Taiyaki Pan (https://www.amazon.com/CookKing-Taiyaki-Japanese-Fish-shaped-Pancake/dp/B06XS5RPQS/)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 egg
¾ cups milk
1/4 cup molasses
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, soda, salt, ginger and cinnamon.
Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together the egg, sugar and milk, then stir in the molasses.
Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and combine.
Brush molds with vegetable oil or spray with cooking spray. Pour a quarter cup of batter for each pancake on a preheated grill on low heat. (Half of the mold)

Close the pan and cook on the first side until the batter is full of bubbles on the surface.
Flip the pancake pan and cook til the second side is lightly browned.

To make rainbow Taiyaki, make regular pancake batter (we recommend from a box!) and split into five separate containers. Use GEL food coloring to change them to any colors you'd like. Pour these separate mixtures into squirt bottles. Heat up your Taiyaki pan on the stove at a low heat. Squirt your rainbow colors into one side of the mold and work quickly so the batter does not spread too much throughout the pan.

If you'd like to place any chocolate stuffing in your taiyaki, place it inside the center of the mold while the batter is still liquid, then cover with more batter before closing the mold.

Conservation laws are among the most important tools in physics. They feel as fundamental as you can get. And yet they’re wrong - or at least they’re only right sometimes.  These laws are consequences of a much deeper, more fundamental principle: Noether’s theorem.

Conservation laws are the cheat codes of physics. They make it possible to solve physics problems that would otherwise be painfully difficult, or even impossible. More than cheat codes – conservation laws are close to the source code – they emerge from profound and simple truths about the basis of reality. They emerge from the fundamental symmetries of nature. The connection between conservation laws and symmetry is encapsulated in Noether’s theorem. But before we dive into this extremely elegant idea, let’s talk about the seeming paradox that inspired it, and the genius who discovered it.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/04s_ACXcvjg/sddefault.jpg,0.005896243360140246,0.000182012386421876,32.39473684210526,0.0017770156674346313,0.006078255746562122,0.007855271413996752,2017-11-15,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,9,38,9,33,52,334,2,79,0,1,9,14,1,0,5.0,8.0,"['iD', 'pean', 'erry', '', 'Da']","['iD', 'pean', 'erry', 'Da']",True,"['iD', 'pean', 'erri', 'Da']",4,4,12,0,0,1,0,6.225317840792588,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

[Intro: Jake Paul]
Yo. JP
Look, I'm a millionaire, but I ain't used nothin' in my life that my teachers taught me

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
My teachers never taught me that
(My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that
How to make my paper stack
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash

[Verse 1: Jake Paul]
My teachers never taught me that (yo)
My teachers never liked me one bit
They said I would amount to be shit
They thought I was just another misfit
I had to make like a banana split
Now, Jakey in a mansion
Got 8 builders for expansion
All these diamonds on my dances
Mrs. Clause just see me flashin'
My Lambo hit the gas
All these Prius's I'm passin'
I went to Calabasas
I feel like Kim Kardashian

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
My teachers never taught me that
(My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that
How to make my paper stack
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash
My teachers never taught me that

[Verse 2: Sunny Malouf]
My teachers said I needed to get up on my grades
I need to get my B's and raise 'em up to dem A's
I walk in the class, I got Supreme on my J's
You always tryna hate but you got nothin' to say
I'm almost at the top, I'm the young Lebron James
I'm not the same in my own brain
I'm in a different lane
It's yo girl Sunny and call me Mrs. Stay-On-Top
I'm on this record, killin' the game, and this a bop

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
My teachers never taught me that
(My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that
How to make my paper stack
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash
My teachers never taught me that

[Verse 3: Anthony Trujillo]
Never taught me how to flow
When I be on the beats
Skippin' class all day
There be F's all on my sheet
Detentions everyday
Got me kicked off the team
And the teachers never cared about my California Dream (no)
I was nothin'
Just a Nerd like Mc Lovin
My teacher's frontin'
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm nothin'
Now I'm somethin'
Speaker's bumpin'
Crowd jumpin'
Money comin'
Wrist flooded
Girls lovin'
Whip stunnin' (damn)

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
My teachers never taught me that
(My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that
How to make my papers stack
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash

The 2018 Grammy stage was truly touched by an angel tonight as Lady Gaga honored her late aunt Joanne with a heartfelt performance, so get those tissues ready.

Welcome back to Newsfeed and thanks for watching our Grammy coverage – And don't forget to subscribe to our channel to get all the latest celebrity updates.

Lady Gaga’s Joanne era might’ve come and gone, but she was sure to send off her fourth consecutive Grammy performance by honoring her late aunt with one heck of a moving show. She took the stage in the middle of the arena tonight with nothing but a piano covered in white angel wings while performing a somber rendition of her hit “Joanne”.

Before belting out the track, Gaga said QUOTE, “This is for my father’s sister, Joanne. This is for love and compassion, even when you can’t understand.” But it wasn’t until halfway through the performance when Gaga received a roar of applause after switching gears and belting out her smash hit single “Million Reasons” with a subtle shout out to the Time’s Up Movement.

Last Friday also marked the premiere of the “Joanne” music video, to which Gaga introduced a much more stripped-down version of the track, and even made a generous donation to the Lupus Research Alliance which her aunt passed away from when she was only 19.

Gaga is currently in the middle of her Joanne World Tour, which wraps next month and is also prepping for the release of her upcoming film A Star is Born AND her very own Las Vegas residency, so needless to say, there will be plenty more show-stopping performances like tonight’s Grammys to come.

But right now, I gotta hear all your thoughts on Gaga’s stunning performance, so get to talking down here in the comments, and after that, you can click right over here for a full rundown of all the best dressed from tonight’s Grammy Awards. Thanks for hanging out with me here on Clevver News, I’m your host Erin Robinson and I’ll see you next time.

Bruce Lee was a Hong Kong and American actor, film director, martial artist, martial arts instructor, philosopher, and founder of the martial art Jeet Kune Do, one of the wushu or kungfu styles. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century.He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films.

The son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen, Lee was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco, California, on November 27, 1940, to parents from Hong Kong, and was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle, and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films dramatically changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world.

He is noted for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films in the early 1970s: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Chinese nationalism in his films and among Asian Americans for defying stereotypes associated with the emasculated Asian male. He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality in Hong Kong and the US. He died in Hong Kong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32, and was buried in Seattle.

Legacy

Bruce Lee was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. In April 2013, he was posthumously awarded the prestigious Founders Award at The Asian Awards.

There are several sites dedicated to Lee around the world:

A 2.5 m (8.2 ft) bronze statue of Lee was unveiled in Hong Kong in 2005, on what would have been his 65th birthday.  The day before the Hong Kong statue was dedicated, the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina unveiled its own 1.68 m (5.5 ft) bronze statue; supporters of the statue cited Lee as a unifying symbol against the ethnic divisions in the country, which had culminated in the 1992-95 Bosnian War. Another statue of Lee was unveiled in Los Angeles, in the Chinatown neighborhood, on June 15, 2013. It stands at 7 ft (210 cm) tall and was made in Guangzhou, China.

On January 6, 2009, it was announced that Lee's Hong Kong home (41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong) would be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by Yu Pang-lin. Yu died in 2015 and this plan did not materialize. In 2018, Yu's grandson, Pang Chi-ping, said: ""We will convert the mansion into a centre for Chinese studies next year, which provides courses like Mandarin and Chinese music for children.""

A theme park dedicated to Lee was built in Jun'an, Guangdong. Mainland Chinese only started watching Bruce Lee films in the 1980s, when videos of classic movies like The Chinese Connection became available. Films like Enter the Dragon and Fists of Fury were banned by Mao as spiritual pollution and rightist sentimentality.

In April 2014, Lee was named a featured character in the video game EA Sports UFC, and is playable in multiple weight classes.

I used very cheap 28BYJ-48 stepper motors. You can find them for a few dollars on amazon. This project felt like a proof of concept. I wanted to proof to myself that it is possible to make a stepper robot arm with very cheap components. At this point in time, the robot arm isn't able to do anything interesting. A teach function is probably the next thing I will add to it. And some kind of gripper. It really needs a gripper!

Here's a blog post about this project:
https://electrondust.com/2018/01/21/small-stepper-robot-arm/

Here are some other things I used on the robot arm:
- A Arduino Mega (This runs a fork of the superb grbl stepper controller software)
- A4988 (The stepper drivers)
- A Raspberry Pi 3 (The replica arm is connected to this. The Raspberry Pi send Gcode to the Arduino via serial)

Here's the code I used on the Raspberry Pi:

The Pi controls an Arduino Mega running a grbl fork with 4 axis stepper support. Here's the fork:

Roseanne was a revelation when it hit the air in 1988. Starring stand-up comedian and self-proclaimed ""domestic goddess"" Roseanne Barr, the refreshingly working class sitcom dominated the TV ratings in the '80s and '90s, and made huge stars out of many in its cast. And it successfully returned to TV in 2018, debuting to huge ratings with its first new episode in years. Here's a look behind the scenes of this smash sitcom...

That is right, it doesn't even have a wiki page! Nuts but true! So, the types are pleomorphic sarcomatoid carcinoma, primary cutaneous carcinosarcoma and unknown sarcomas.

My cancer is now classed as terminal as not a single person, doctor or medical professional is sure what to do with it! They can't give me a precise timeline as no one has made it this far before with so many reccurances and spread.

We are litterally trying everything now to keep me alive!

I have a Go Fund Me setup if you would like to support me get research done into this and pass on tissue samples in the hope we find a way to treat this.

안녕하세요
오늘은 티라미수 타르트를 준비했어요 

특히 이 타르트는 가나슈가 꼭 들어가는게 좋아요 
가나슈 + 치즈 크림이 잘 어울리거든요 

크림사이에 제누와즈를 1장 넣어보세요 
저는 타르트만 생각하고 만들어서 시트를 넣지 않고 커피는 가나슈에 넣었습니다

저는 타르트 링을 사용했는데 일반 타르트 팬을 쓰셔도 됩니다

▶재료 (18cm 타르트 1개) 

+ 타르트지
버터 60g, 슈가파우더 30g, 노른자 1개, 박력분 120g, 코코아가루 10g
(덧 가루용 코코아가루 약간)

+ 커피 가나슈
다크 초콜릿 140g, 생크림 110ml, 인스턴트커피 3g

+ 크림 cream
마스카포네 & 크림치즈 150g, 설탕 40g, 생크림 150ml

+ 마무리
코코아가루 15g

1) 타르트지 - 말랑한 버터를 풀어줍니다
2) 슈가파우더, 노른자를 하나씩 넣어가며 섞어줍니다
3) 박력분과 코코아가루를 체쳐 넣고 뭉치도록 섞어줍니다
4) 한 덩어리가 되면 랩으로 감싸 냉장실에 30분 동안 둡니다
5) 반죽을 밀대로 얇게 밀어 타르트 팬에 넣고 눌러줍니다
6) 포크로 구멍을 뚫어 종이호일을 깔고 누름돌을 올려 예열된 오븐에 구워줍니다
   (180도 20분 굽고 누름돌과 종이호일을 제거하고 5분간 더 구워줍니다)
7) 구운 타르트는 완전히 식혀 틀에서 분리합니다 

8) 가나슈 - 생크림을 냄비에 담아 끓여줍니다 (약불)
9) 생크림이 끓으면 불을 끄고 초콜릿을 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다
10) 초콜릿이 녹아 잘 섞이면 커피를 넣고 잘 섞어 구운 타르트에 넣어 평평하게 해줍니다
11) 냉장실에 30분 넣어둡니다

12) 크림 - 실온에 둔 크림치즈(혹은 마스카포네)를 풀어줍니다
13) 설탕을 넣고 잘 섞어줍니다
14) 생크림을 넣고 거품기로 크림이 단단해지도록 휘핑합니다
15) 짤주머니나 스페츄라를 이용해 타르트위에 올려줍니다 
    (저는 지름 2cm 원형 깍지를 사용해서 올렸어요)
16) 코코아가루를 뿌려 마무리 합니다 

+ 맛은 좋아요 (???) 
가나슈가 진짜 신의 한 수? 까지는 아니지만 너무 잘 어울립니다
티라미수 좋아하는 사람에게 선물한다면 아주 좋은 선물이 될 것 같아요 
위에 장식은 본인 취향대로 하시면 됩니다 꼭 저처럼 안해도 됩니다 
(선물한다면 가지고 나가지 직전에 슈가파우더를 뿌려주고 코코아가루를 뿌려주세요
그럼 조금이라도 더 덜 눅눅해질 거예요)
여름에는 젤라틴을 넣는게 좋습니다 (날이 더우면 금방 크림이 녹을 수 있어요)

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다
시청해주셔서 감사합니다

➥ Lyrics:
The oceans part
You and me in the middle
With a heavy heart
So much talk
But I just want to touch
You're a magnet marked
I just want to touch
I just want to touch
 
It was lighter than the air
It was warmer when we hold
I feel whenever we are near
The heavens open up
And we collide in our deep love
 
Falling hard
So much blue
In the echo pulling us apart
But I've found your arms
And I just want to touch
You're a magnet marked
I just want to touch
I just want to touch
 
It was lighter than the air
It was warmer when we hold
I feel whenever we are near
The heavens open up
And we collide in our deep love",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09NJc8fevyA/sddefault.jpg,0.0068800251303261705,0.00033058345736445703,20.811764705882357,9.423872314009409e-05,0.0072106085876906265,0.007304847310830722,2017-11-17,15:00:01,Friday,4,7,37,7,29,35,257,2,52,0,0,5,5,0,0,4.0,6.0,['La'],['La'],True,['La'],1,1,2,0,0,1,0,6.182815366980791,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'car': 4},4

Yes! Reinforcement learning is a technique that lets an agent learn how best to act in an environment using rewards as its signal. OpenAI released a library called Gym that lets us train AI agents really easily. We'll use a combination of the Tensorflow and gym libraries to build an RL agent capable of landing a rocket perfectly. The specific technique we're using is called proximal policy optimization, this is an actor-critic algorithm that is really popular. Lets get started!

In this episode of the Keiser Report from Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, Max and Stacy ask, 'Oye como va?' as they listen to the rhythm of the survivors of PROMESA and Hurricane Maria.  In the second half, Max interviews lawyer, John Mudd, about the role of the state power company, PREPA, in the island’s debt problems. Mudd also mentions the matter of ‘statehood’ and what that would even give the people of Puerto Rico.

This title sequence is inspired by the wonderful designs of the Imperial Eggs by Peter Carl Faberge, which represented the perfect combination of creativity and craftsmanship, with a secret inside. 

We have interpreted the beauty of the Imperial Eggs into a richly detailed and jewelled football, each panel has its own identity and elements that represent the richness of Russian culture. 

At the heart of each of these panel sits a jewel, which houses archive of each nation who has won the FIFA World Cup™ - Brazil, Uruguay, England, Italy, Argentina, France, Spain and Germany.

Check out this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos

Here is a brief description of calculus, integration and differentiation and one example of where it is useful: deriving new physics. In this video I start with a very simple derivation which shows the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy, and then show a simple introduction to integration and differentiation.

When I learned physics at University one of the most satisfying experiences was getting to grips with calculus enough to use it to derive equations as it allowed me to wield mathematics to describe the world, which felt awesome.

Is Freezing Salmon Really Necessary? 
http://sushieveryday.com/freezing-salmon-sushi/

Read Why I Love Using this Knife for Salmon:
http://sushieveryday.com/fillet-salmon-sushi-special-knife/

Salmon is one of the more difficult fish to fillet for sushi and sashimi applications. The soft delicate flesh gaps easily if handled too aggressively, so it's a challenging fish to train others. The use of a hollow ground slicer instead of the traditional Japanese deba knife is a much easier approach in terms of speed and minimizes handling. 

Over the years, I've used Japanese and Western filleting knives to test what is the most efficient way to fillet salmon. And quite honestly, I believe Western style knives (8"" fillet blade and hollow ground slicer) is superior. Some Japanese chefs may disagree, but I have seen salmon processors cut salmon like the wind with minimal effort compared to using Japanese style blades. However, after filleting, the use of a Yanagiba is still best for cutting nigiri or sashimi pieces. So a combo of 2 style is my preference.  Check out my Udemy Course to learn more!

Avengers Infinity War opened with $250 million domestic and now holds the record for biggest opening weekend of all-time beating out Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which previously held the title with an opening weekend of $248 million.

Deadline reports that Annapurna Pictures and Plan B Entertainment have acquired the rights to the story of the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and their investigation into the Weinstein scandal. The Deadline story stresses that the film is being compared to Spotlight.

THR reports that Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the first two Annabelle movies will also write the third installment and make his directing debut on the picture. New Line is fast-tracking the third Annabelle movie for a July 3, 2019 release date.

Variety reports that Michelle Pfeiffer is in advanced talks to play the queen in Maleficent 2 opposite Angelina Jolie. Deadpool actor Ed Skrein joined as the sequel’s villain. Jolie and Elle Fanning are both set to reprise their roles for Maleficent 2. Pirates of the Caribbean director  Joachim Ronning is set to helm the sequel.

A featurette for Lucasfilm’s Solo: A Star Wars Story was released by Disney yesterday featuring new footage with a new behind the scenes look. The film features Hail, Caesar‘s Alden Ehrenreich as Han, with Atlanta‘s Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian and The Force Awakens‘ Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca.

Lyrics: 
The space between where our ends meet 
Has grown too much for me to block it out 
I miss the tone of your heartbeat 
It’s such a warming and familiar sound 

I hope you’re finding the power 
To help you make it through the darker days 
For now I’ll wait by the hour 
If you wanna take somebody’s breath away 

I hope you’re lonely, hope you’re lost ‘cause I’ve been 
And I’d hate to think you’re better off without me 
I know we tried to hold on 
But where do you go 
When love it just ain’t enough 

Now does it kill you when you think about me 
Are you as close to giving up as I’ve been 
I know we kept losing touch got lost in the rush 
I pray you don’t hurt too much 

I don’t come close to an angel 
And you ain’t never been no kind of saint 
but when we both came together 
Hell to heaven you were my escape 

But fires don’t burn forever 
And all these ashes crumble when we touch 
We danced to death in the fire 
What can we do now the music’s done, my love 

I hope you’re lonely, hope you’re lost ‘cause I’ve been 
And I’d hate to think you’re better off without me 
I know we tried to hold on 
But where do you go 
When love it just ain’t enough 

Now does it kill you when you think about me 
Are you as close to giving up as I’ve been 
I know we kept losing touch got lost in the rush 
I pray you don’t hurt too much 

Well we had it all, and we let it fall 
But I hope you find whatever you were looking for 
Well we had it all, and we let it fall 
Lost in the rush but I pray you don’t hurt too much

If anyone has been keeping track, it’s been roughly two months since news broke regarding both Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian’s reported pregnancy and we STILL don’t really have any confirmation as to whether or not the pregnancies are real. 
Neither Kylie or Khloe have said anything. Kim took one for the team and drank a sardine smoothie instead of talking about the pregnancies. And Kris hasn’t said anything either…until maybe now. Or six days ago when she posted a very telling Instagram post of bundles of pajamas for her grandkids. 
Kris kaptioned the image QUOTE, “Thank you so much Burt’s Bees Baby for the most amazing collection of family jammies ever and I am obsessed with the plaid!! Can’t wait to cuddle up with the kids this holiday season. Thank you for a collection for every one of my grandchildren.” 
And if you look klosely at the photo there are NINE jammy collections. NINE. We all know Kris currently has six grandkids, Mason, Penelope, Reign, North, Saint, and Dream…and then Kim’s unborn child on the way. Seven. That leaves TWO of the packages unaccounted for!
Could it be that Kris was hinting at Khloe and Kylie’s unconfirmed buns in the oven?! A bunch of fans are freaking out in Kris’ comment section, however a few are unconvinced that the extra jammy sets are for Khloe and Kylie. 
One fan wrote, “Has anyone thought Kim could be having more than one baby?” While another completely dismissed the possibility of Khloe and Kylie being pregnant by saying, “People seem to be forgetting the fact that she has step grandkids. Caitlyn’s kids have kids. Kylie isn’t pregnant, it’s obvious.”
Welp, regardless of whether or not the extra two bundles are for Koko and Kyles or someone else, it’s safe to say that any and every baby post is keeping us all on the edge of our seats. 
Do you think Kris was hinting at Khloe and Kylie’s pregnancies or do you think everyone is just reading WAYY too much into the photo? Let me know in the comment section below. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Renee Ariel and I’ll see ya next time.
