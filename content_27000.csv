Yoshida has experience in Sony's US operations, as well as its network, financial and investor relations businesses. 
Yoshida and Hirai shook hands, appearing together before reporters at Sony's Tokyo headquarters.
Hirai said the company was approaching a ""crucial juncture, when we will embark on a new mid-range plan"".
Kenichiro Yoshida, who has held the post of Chief Financial Officer with Sony Corp, underlined how the company's position in the global market has changed in the last 20 years, but stressed that the brand name remained its biggest asset.
Also on Friday, Sony reported fiscal third quarter profit of 296 billion yen (2.7 billion US dollars), up dramatically from 19.6 billion yen the same period a year ago.
Quarterly sales rose nearly 12 percent to 2.67 trillion yen.

I was overwhelmed by the amount of emails and messages I received in response. I didn't want the conversation to end there, so I decided to start a podcast where I invited others to share their experiences. It was a huge success, so for series two I wanted to progress things and film it too. So every Tuesday at 5pm I'll be uploading the video footage from the podcast here... I guess that makes it a vidcast, but let's not get too technical. 

The series will be a collection of frank and warm conversations with high-profile mums and dads. We'll be discussing all aspects of parenthood  - the highs, the lows, the challenges and rewards. There is no such thing as the perfect parent. Instead, we’re all simply doing our best. It’s time to stop comparing ourselves and champion each other instead. Each episode will be truly unique yet unifying. No topic is out of bounds, and I hope the podcast and supporting video will be essential viewing for any parent seeking solidarity and support.

A huge thank you to Fisher-Price for sponsoring both the podcast and these videos, who celebrates a child’s uniqueness and encourages parents to just, let kids be kids!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yatoq1bzY6I/sddefault.jpg,0.02335828102366007,0.00030178657653307585,77.4,0.002444471269917914,0.023660067600193145,0.026104538870111056,2018-03-13,17:00:02,Tuesday,1,12,26,10,24,57,222,5,38,7,0,2,15,1,0,4.0,8.0,"['\\', '', '  ', '', 'mi', '\\', '5 a', 'ATCC MAT LLU Le']","['\\', 'mi', '\\', '5', 'a', 'ATCC', 'MAT', 'LLU', 'Le']",True,"['\\', 'mi', '\\', '5', 'a', 'atcc', 'mat', 'llu', 'Le']",9,8,18,2,0,1,1,6.6220869926769925,3,"['scared', 'happy', 'scared']",0,0,2,1,0,0,0,"{'book': 1, 'bottle': 1, 'person': 3}",5

The highly-anticipated Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show finally aired last night and although the clothes and models were insanely gorgeous, Harry Styles definitely stole the show.

The “Sign of the Times” singer was one of four performers and he left it all on stage. When we first found out that Harry was confirmed to do the show, we instantly began dreaming of how incredible it would be with him dancing around on stage in a Gucci suit surrounded by some of the most beautiful people in the world. Thankfully, we were NOT disappointed. 

Harry serenaded the models, and us, with his newest single Kiwi and “Only Angel”, a fan favorite from his self-titled album. Obviously Harry absolutely killed it and we will be re-watching his performances for the rest of the day.

It wouldn’t be a Harry Styles performance without tons of hilarious and dad-like dance moves, and the fashion show was no different.

Fans were quick to point his quirky moves and we even got some behind-the-scenes video from very lucky people who got to experience the show IRL. 

We have to give Harry some serious props because not only did he give one of his best performances, but he did it in front of not one, not two but THREE of his ex’s. Georgia Fowler, Sara Sampaio and Nadine Leopold have all been romantically linked to Harry and all three walked in the show. There wasn’t a moment where he shared a LOOK with any of them, like when Bella Hadid and The Weeknd reunited for the first time since their breakup, but he did look like he was having the time of his life. 

Did you watch the fashion show and what was your favorite part? Let us know in the comments below! I’m Ashley Iaconetti, thanks for tuning in!

An 18th-century wooden carving of Jesus holds a message from the past. Conservators with Madrid-based Da Vinci Restauro were examining a crucifix from a church about 80 miles north of the Spanish capital. The statue turned out to be hollow with a removable panel. Located on the figure’s backside, the opening was hidden by the cross. Inside lay a letter describing life in Spain in 1777, written by a chaplain, Joaquín Mínguez. The priest names the reigning monarch, Carlos III, catalogues crops and products such as wine. He tells of the Inquisition and of happier customs, with music and games. Mínguez seems to have intentionally placed the letter to serve as a time capsule. The document itself will go to an archive. But to honor Mínguez's wishes, a copy will stay within the statue.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YcV2auf6Yw4/sddefault.jpg,0.012069653411704686,0.0002638056471850193,45.752066115702476,0.0003771766691157713,0.012333459058889705,0.012710635728005477,2018-03-28,08:35:00,Wednesday,2,8,37,8,32,43,328,2,76,0,1,6,16,2,0,4.0,8.0,"[""'S |"", 'ou']","[""'S"", '|', 'ou']",True,"[""'S"", '|', 'ou']",3,3,5,1,1,1,0,6.232423509584797,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

[EVE V REVIEW]

When I first heard about the Eve V, I saw it as just another Microsoft Surface lookalike and quickly forgot it. But when I was offered a chance to review it I looked into Eve again – and found a company trying to do in the PC space what OnePlus has done in smartphones. Namely: build something powerful, price it affordably, and give users a voice in the process. I’m MrMobile and this is the first crowdsourced computer I’ve ever used; join me for the Eve V review!

[ABOUT MRMOBILE'S EVE V REVIEW]

MrMobile's Eve V review was produced following two weeks with an Eve V review device provided by Eve-Tech. The Eve V review sample was a pre-production device in the Core i5/8GB configuration and required a re-install of Windows 10 Home to fix a keyboard error (which did not solve the issue). Eve-Tech has promised to provide a replacement keyboard for further testing; if it solves the problem it will be reported in the comments.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

We got to do a lot of shopping this day because not only was it our last day in Disneyland, but also the crowd level was so high all of the ride lines were incredibly long. We headed over to Adventureland to ride the Western River Railroad which is very similar to the railroad at Disneyland California but slightly shorter. We also decided to watch the Dream Up parade one last time and got a really good spot to see it this time. It was also the full parade which we didn't get to see the day before because of high winds. While waiting for the parade we tried a few interesting and cute foods like a Mike Wazoski melon bread, a Mickey Shaped sweet bread with 3 different kinds of filling, a 35cm hot dog celebrating 35 years of Tokyo Disneyland, and a chicken sandwich on a bun shaped like Mickey Mouse's hands! After the parade we started to head out of Disneyland leading us into tomorrow's video where we check out the Disneyland Hotel and head back into Tokyo Disney Sea one last time! Join us tomorrow for another new video!

Zucchini Lasagna
Servings: 8-10

INGREDIENTS
2 zucchinis
1 cup grated parmesan

Sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ large white onion
2 cloves garlic
1 pound ground turkey
28 ounces crushed tomatoes
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons dried oregano
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 bay leaf

Cheese Mixture
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced
¼ cup grated parmesan
¼ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper


PREPARATION
 1. Cut the ends off of the zucchini, and cut in half, lengthwise. 
 2. Using a vegetable peeler, peel long strips of zucchini (these will be your “noodles”) and set on a baking sheet lined with paper towels.
 3. Dab zucchini strips with a paper towel to absorb the excess moisture.
 4. In a large pot, add olive oil, onions, and garlic. Cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes.
 5. Add ground turkey, and cook for another 4-5 minutes, or until the turkey has browned slightly.
 6. Pour in crushed tomatoes, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, tomato paste, and a bay leaf. Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes.
 7. PREHEAT oven to 375˚F/190˚C.
 8. In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.
 9. Using a baking dish, layer turkey sauce, zucchini strips, ricotta mixture, and parmesan. Repeat until there are 3 layers total, ending with the turkey sauce and topping that with parmesan cheese.
 10. Bake for 50 minutes (times and temperatures may vary depending on the oven).
 11. Let rest for at least 20 minutes.
 12. Serve & enjoy!

Disney/Pixar’s Incredibles 2 opens in theatres June 15!

In “Incredibles 2,” Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack—whose superpowers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don’t shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That’s what makes this family so Incredible.

From the variation in line length, to motor and CG placement, as well as the torque compensation blades! 

I already had all of the parts laying around, so this only cost me the price of the wing. However, if you wish to build your own, it'll cost about £130 (if you already own the remote control equipment).

Here are the parts used
Parafoil Wing: https://goo.gl/8DvNYC

Electronic Speed Controller: https://goo.gl/B1qNeF
Servos (x2): https://goo.gl/JxozCL

Also requires a transmitter and receiver for control. I use the following: https://goo.gl/keLdb2 (affiliate link)

Great Wide Open
Thirty Seconds To Mars

Is this life
That we’re living
Say the prayers of a thousand tongues

Is this love
Some new beginning
Or a night in our wildest dreams

Into the great wide open
Across a land of blood and dreams
I will save your heart from breaking
Won’t you stop please
Set me free

I swear to god
I’m the devil
Raise your hands to the sky and praise

I’m a thief
You’re a liar
But we live in our wildest dreams

Into the great wide open
Across a land of blood and dreams
I will save your heart from breaking
Won’t you stop please
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

Let it out
Let it out go
Time to lay down your arms

Let it out
Let it out go
Time to lay down your arms
 
Into the great wide open
Across a land of love and dreams
I will save your heart from breaking
Won’t you stop please
Set me free

Raise your hands to the sky
Set me free
Raise your hands to the sky
Set me free
Raise your hands to the sky

Won’t you stop
Please
Set me free

These are all of the tricks I was able to learn in that time. I definitely believe that achieving five balls would have been possible if I had a more structured practice routine, however three ball juggling is a lot of fun and is also much easier to practice in a shorter time span. Some of these patterns are also a bit sloppy/asymmetrical because I never quite got them down or simply forgot how to do them over the course of the year :P Juggling has definitely changed my life for the better, and I am not planning on stopping anytime soon!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YfSUXAi80w8/sddefault.jpg,0.03431814874108572,0.0003784019793334304,90.69230769230772,0.003347402124872653,0.034696550720419155,0.03804395284529182,2018-01-10,23:27:50,Wednesday,2,10,1,9,1,67,2,3,2,0,0,8,0,2,0,6.0,2.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.488973688212522,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'sports ball': 2, 'person': 1}",3

Tonight’s iHeart radio awards kicked things off by giving the award for Best Collab to the Chainsmokers and Coldplay for their hit, “Something Just Like This”. Although Coldplay were not in attendance to collect the award alongside the Chainsmokers duo, the guys gave a big shout out to their collab partners and thanked Chris Martin and crew for inspiring them in more ways than one. 

The Chainsmokers also won Best Dance Artist of the Year at the show. 

Another big winner of the night was Ed Sheeran, who won Song of the Year for “Shape of You” and Best Male artist. Unfortunately Ed wasn’t able to attend the show in person, but he did give a live acceptance speech from Melbourne, Australia, which he immediately followed up with a performance of his latest hit, “Perfect”.
Even though Ed couldn’t be at the show, we’re so glad he made the effort to thank his fans in this unconventional way. Speaking of which, his pal Taylor Swift also had to give her acceptance speech via video since she’s busy rehearsing for her upcoming Reputation tour. Taylor won the iHeart Female Artist of the Year award, and as a gesture of thanks to her fans, she premiered her video for “Delicate” right after her pre-recorded speech.

Cardi B also won big at the show tonight, taking home the award for Best New Artist AND Best New Hip Hop Artist. She was up against Niall Horan and Khalid among others, but don’t feel too bad for those guys, because Niall took home the Best New Pop Artist award, while Khalid won Best New R&B Artist. 

In other notable categories, Kendrick Lamar was given the Best Rap Artist of the Year award, meanwhile Bruno Mars won Best R&B Artist of the Year, and Maroon 5 won Best Group. 

DJ Khaled, who co-hosted the show with Hailee Baldwin, took home an iHeart trophy for Hip Hop Song of the Year thanks to his smash hit, “Wild Thoughts”. And during his acceptance speech he made sure to give huge shout outs to Rihanna, Bryson Tiller, and of course, his adorable son, Asahd.

Beauty brand L’Oreal also presented a “Fangirls” award at the show, which went to the always amazing Camila Cabello.

That girl deserves every good thing that comes her way, and we can’t wait to see her tour with Taylor Swift for “Reputation”...talk about one hell of an opening act. 

iHeart also gave out awards for fan-voted categories, and some honorable mentions from those include Niall Horan winning Best Lyrics for “Sow Hands”, Louis Tomlinson winning Best Solo Breakout, and Harry Styles winning Best Music Video for “Sign of the Times.” Is it me or do the fans always seem to vote in ONE DIRECTION when it comes to award shows? Sorry guys, I just had to do it. 

Alright so now it’s time for you guys to let me know your thoughts on all of tonight’s winners--were there any big snubs or wins that had you SHOOK?

MEAN GIRLS is a ferociously funny new musical from an award-winning creative team, including director Casey Nicholaw (Aladdin, The Book of Mormon), composer Jeff Richmond (“30 Rock,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”), lyricist Nell Benjamin (Legally Blonde), and book writer Tina Fey (“30 Rock,” Bossypants). Vogue cheers, “MEAN GIRLS is HILARIOUS! The cast is sensational – expert comedians with fierce voices and acting chops to match.” USA Today says, “We’ll let you in on a little secret, because we’re such good friends: GET YOUR TICKETS NOW.”

Big moments came from unexpected sources, while the usual heroes weren't providing the kind of impact we were used to. So it made sense that Derek Fisher, who'd only taken six shots up to that point, got the ball with 0.4 seconds left and the Lakers facing a critical loss.

Also, Gary Payton was there. Again, kind of weird.

Lithophanes are back! To welcome the new year I've been working on spherical lithophanes, so instead of just 3D printing a flat image, I'm now attaching the picture to a sphere! I found the world map to be a perfect picture, and a perfect match for this project. Here's my result guys, hope you'll like it!

The 3D printed lithophane was printed in 94h, using white PLA filament. Can you use other filament colors? Yes you can but white will look the best. 

The 3D printer used in this video was the Creality CR-10S, it's probably my favourite printer at the moment. If you want to know more which 3D printer to pick you can check out my latest comparison video: https://youtu.be/2IE6hSQu4lI

Find the courage to face the darkness. Be a warrior. #WrinkleinTime --- Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres in 3D March 9th! From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light. 
Directed by Emmy winner and Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Oscar winner Jennifer Lee based upon the beloved novel by Madeleine L’Engle, “A Wrinkle in Time” stars: two-time Academy Award nominee Oprah Winfrey, Oscar and Emmy winner Reese Witherspoon, Emmy nominee Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Peňa and introducing Storm Reid, with two-time Emmy winner Zach Galifianakis and Emmy nominee Chris Pine. Produced by Jim Whitaker and Catherine Hand with Doug Merrifield serving as executive producer, the film also boasts an impressive creative team featuring some of the most talented artisans working today, including: Tobias Schliessler, ASC as director of photography, Naomi Shohan as production designer, Oscar-nominee Spencer Averick as film editor, two-time Academy Award-nominee Paco Delgado as costume designer and four time Emmy nominee Ramin Djawadi as composer.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ykz1NMJc-bE/sddefault.jpg,0.013259065093927479,0.0006116207951070336,21.678571428571423,0.0010048055919615552,0.013870685889034513,0.014875491480996069,2018-04-27,05:16:38,Friday,4,9,35,9,30,45,306,2,73,0,1,7,14,2,0,4.0,8.0,['CORDEN'],['CORDEN'],True,['corden'],1,1,6,0,0,0,0,5.014426489836843,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

It turns out we make a huge mistake but you can avoid it if you follow some simple everyday rules. Note, there’s a bonus in the end of the video that explains how we can get good sleep with the help of a pencil.
If you don’t eat a few hours before you go to bed, you won’t sleep well. Hunger often causes insomnia and if you go to bed without having dinner you’ll probably need a large breakfast. Evening strolls are proven to be good for health and they help cope with insomnia, according to National Sleep Foundation research.
Thorough planning before bed will help you stay calm in the morning and perform all necessary actions step-by-step without wasting precious time and energy. The same is true for your outfit and lunch. 

Spend at least 10 minutes meditating before you go to bed. It’s important to concentrate your attention on your inner awareness. Reading is another great way to relax because plunging into a different world helps in getting rid of the stress from daily problems better than both tea and music.
Brushing the hair before bed cleans away dead cells, dust, and skin fat. And a light massage with a smooth brush helps transport oxygen and nutrient rich materials to the roots. In the morning, you won’t need to style your hair in a hurry.

SUMMARY
-It’s good to eat some meat or cottage cheese before bed because both products contain a lot of protein and tryptophan.
-A stroll before bed will help you “step over” all the worries of the day and avoid insomnia and some other health problems. 
-Making your plans at night contributes to keeping your life in order.
-Open the window in your bedroom at night to cool the air and help white fat transform into brown and improve your metabolism.
-If you have your outfit and lunch prepared for the next day, it will save your time and nerves in the morning.
-Evening yoga helps put our thoughts and emotions in order, relieve tension, and get us ready to greet the next day. 
-A change in body temperature during a hot shower creates an impulse in our body to fall asleep faster. A warm tub is actually a great way to cope with insomnia.
-Your brain memorizes everything better at night. 
-Consuming 2 kiwi one hour before going to bed over the course of a month helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.
-2 glasses of cherry juice before bed help you sleep nearly 90 more minutes a night.
-Brushing the hair before bed cleans away dead cells, dust, and skin fat.
-Studies show that doing a daily analysis before sleep is very useful.
-During your free time, place a pencil between your teeth and hold it for 5-10 minutes. This simple exercise can help cope with snoring and also relieve a headache.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YnjWyT-oumg/sddefault.jpg,0.026547751593261552,9.911424899481632e-05,267.85,0.0006896699825889303,0.026646865842256368,0.0273365358248453,2017-12-01,09:35:00,Friday,4,8,38,8,33,41,334,0,79,0,1,7,14,2,0,4.0,8.0,"['ROOSEVELT', '‘ HOTEL']","['ROOSEVELT', '‘', 'HOTEL']",True,"['roosevelt', '‘', 'hotel']",3,3,15,0,0,0,0,6.192538960607162,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Just know if you do plan on buying this product it does oxidize dramatically so... I thought the color was pretty close to my skin tone until the oxygen hit it.... This foundation could be decent to cover a tattoo.. maybe.. lol but for the face I do not recommend. Thanks for watching I hope you had some giggles with me and Joey xo- Laura
ps: because I bought this off Ebay.. I feel like I bought a fake ripoff version.. :( I should have known better... mine DID NOT perform like the dermacol in other videos.. Thanks for watching this deserves a re-do sawyyy

---During a discussion about the Nunes memo on today’s broadcast of Fox News’ The Five, co-host Jesse Watters attempted to flip the script on colleague Juan Williams by bringing up racial disparity in local law enforcement.

Watters wanted Williams to know that there Trump isn’t trying to undermine the Russia investigation by authorizing the release of the memo and that this was instead about Congressional oversight. He then went on to state that the reason the FBI doesn’t want it released is that it is “very embarrassing” for them. Watters followed that up by making a comparison while trying to call Williams out for hypocrisy.

“I want the record to show that for the last year you said law enforcement needs to be — have body cameras on them and we have to look out for bias in law enforcement,” Watters declared. “Now we actually have evidence of bias in law enforcement and you don’t want to know about it, Juan.”---",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpADE6-AUK0/sddefault.jpg,0.01948909076791676,0.0013199782591816135,14.764705882352946,0.0068716515257395755,0.020809069027098386,0.027680720552837955,2018-02-03,05:00:02,Saturday,5,9,57,9,48,54,475,0,98,0,0,9,5,1,2,5.0,7.0,['-'],['-'],True,['-'],1,1,1,1,0,0,0,5.727832381803576,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",2

i’m a match, she’s kerosene, 
you know she’s gonna burn down everything
she’s an arsonist, in her pastime, 
and i’ve been burned for the last time

it started out like any other morning, 
the sky was red, he took it as a warning
she kicked the hive now the bees are swarming
then played the victim 'til the crowd starts forming

she’s got a history of making a scene, 
yeah she’s telling stories, she’s gaslighting
like he’s the executioner and she is the queen, 
but he’s the one who’s neck is in a guillotine, 

he said i’m a match, she’s kerosene, 
you know she’s gonna burn down everything
she’s an arsonist, in her pastime, 
and i’ve been burned for the last time

the smoke clears out and he’s been awakened. 
he said this life could be mine for the taking
she needs a drink so she start shaking, 
and play the victim 'til his heart starts breaking

no real tears cause she don’t mean it, 
this landscape used to be so scenic
and he could make it out, if he could dream it. 
rising up from the ash, he’s a phoenix

i’m a match, she’s kerosene, 
you know she’s gonna burn down everything
she’s an arsonist, in her pastime, 
and i’ve been burned for the last time

you play with me, you're playin' with fire

His Neapolitan pizza is naturally leavened, never refrigerated, and feels remarkably complex for all its simplicity. In 2009, when he moved Una Pizza Napoletana from New York's East Village to San Francisco, his cult following was dejected. 

Lucky for us, Anthony's East Coast personality never fully adapted to the West Coast life, so he's back. Unlike in the past when Una Pizza Napoletana was mostly a one-man operation with a limited menu, Anthony has teamed up with the chefs behind the Lower East Side's Wildair and Contra, Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra. Una Pizza is back in New York and we couldn't be happier.

Correspondents Michael Moynihan and Isobel Yeung travel across the country — and south of the border — to chart the progress of key campaign promises, and meet the voters who rallied behind Trump’s political revolution.

The documentary special features insights from Trump surrogates including political consultant Roger Stone and conservative commentator Ann Coulter. We also hear from key opposition players including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

Undergirding it all is a focus group of Trump voters led by Republican Strategist Frank Luntz. Almost all of the people who voted for Trump in 2016 say he’d still get their vote today. “My biggest surprise in the last year is that many, many Trump voters are as mad at the GOP as they are at the Democrats. It’s Trump versus the world.”

We may be counting down the last few weeks of 2017, but there’s still plenty of time for one more viral trend to sweep the Internet, so feast your eyes upon the Invisible Box Challenge.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but for all you hopefuls out there, defying gravity is much easier said than done…

Step aside Mannequin Challenge, Ice Bucket Challenge, and all other viral internet challenges, because the all-new Invisible Box challenge is here, and it’s taking the world by storm one step at a time… literally.

This gravity-defying challenge went viral in just minutes all thanks to Texas high school cheerleader Ariel Olivar, who demonstrated the stunt during her high school’s football game, where she perfectly executed the illusion of stepping over an invisible box, and before you ask me to demonstrate, don’t, because this stunt is exactly as impossible as it sounds:

The saying “don’t try this at home” clearly didn’t resonate with the internet, but thankfully Ariel broke down the steps on The Today Show, so try this at your own risk. First, she said, you have to show that there really is nothing in front of you. Then, you pat the air about a foot off the ground, but not too high. Once you put your foot on top of the box, your hovering leg has to stay in the exact same place. When you're jumping over with your other leg, your foot that's going over the box has to be higher than your standing foot.

Many people attempting to demonstrate the challenge aren’t exactly executing as gracefully as Ariel, however one Anderson University football player managed to perfect the stunt just as flawlessly as Ariel, so maybe it’s an athlete thing? But one reason why people may be having trouble with the trick is because it isn’t just your legs that are responsible for getting it done – it’s your entire body AKA your glutes, back, shoulders, and everything you forget to focus on during your once-a-month gym sesh. Trainer Amelia DiDomenico also revealed that in addition, the muscles on the side that's hovering also have to be firing to hold your leg in the air (especially your hovering glute).

Soooo I don’t know about you guys, but I’m thinking it’s best I pick back up on the next viral Internet challenge, you know, just to spare myself a pulled muscle or my dignity. But I want to know if you guys have attempted the invisible box challenge, and if so share all your tips and tricks down here in the comments, and after that, be sure to click right over here to check out the new Ugg heel boots that are all the rave(?) right now. Thanks for joining me on Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey and stay safe out there, kids.

Confused 1+2+3+…=-1/12 comments originating from that infamous Numberphile video keep flooding the comment sections of my and other math YouTubers videos. And so I think it’s time to have another serious go at setting the record straight by having a really close look at the bizarre calculation at the center of the Numberphile video, to state clearly what is wrong with it, how to fix it, and how to reconnect it to the genuine math that the Numberphile professors had in mind originally.

This is my second attempt at doing this topic justice. This video is partly in response to feedback that I got on my first video. What a lot of you were interested in were more details about the analytic continuation business and the strange Numberphile/Ramanujan calculations. Responding to these requests, in this video I am taking a very different approach from the first video and really go all out and don't hold back in any respect. The result is a video that is a crazy 41.44 (almost 42 :) minutes long.

Lots of amazing maths to look forward to: non-standard summation methods for divergent series, the eta function a very well-behaved sister of the zeta function, the gist of analytic continuation in simple words, etc.

The original Numberphile video is here
https://youtu.be/w-I6XTVZXww . Also check out the links to further related Numberphile videos and write-ups in the description of that video.

Here is a link to Ramanujan’s notebook that contains his Numberphile-like 1+2+3+… = -1/12 calculation. http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/NoteBooks/NoteBook1/chapterVIII/page3.htm
This notebook entry was also one of the starting points of my last video on this topic: https://youtu.be/jcKRGpMiVTw

Other good videos that deal with this strange “identity” include the following:
https://youtu.be/0Oazb7IWzbA (a Numberphile video featuring the mathematician Edward Frenkel who is also talking about the connection between the Riemann Zeta function and Ramanujan's crazy identity.)
https://youtu.be/sD0NjbwqlYw (a nice 3Blue1Brown video about visualizing the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta function).

If you know some calculus and want to read up on all this, beyond what is readily available via the relevant Wiki pages and other internet resources, I recommend you read the last chapter of the book by Konrad Knopp, Theory and applications of infinite series, Dover books, 1990 (actually if you know German, read the extended version of this chapter in the 1924 (2nd) edition of the book ""Theorie und Anwendung der unendlichen Reihen"". The Dover book is a translation of the 4th German edition. The 5th German edition from 1964 can be found here: https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN378970429).

People usually recommend Hardy's book, Divergent series, but I'd say only look at this after you've looked at Knopp's book which I find a lot more accessible. Having said that, Hardy's book does have quite a bit of detail on how Ramanujan summation applies to the Zeta function; see chapters 13.10. and 13.17.

The article by Terry Tao that I mentioned at the end of the video lives here: https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/the-euler-maclaurin-formula-bernoulli-numbers-the-zeta-function-and-real-variable-analytic-continuation/

Thank you very much to my mathematician friend Marty Ross for all his feedback on the script of this video and for being the grumpy voice in the background and Danil Dmitriev the official Mathologer translator for Russian for his subtitles.

Enjoy :)

The Last Jedi finally arrives in theaters next week, but the lucky folks who attended the Hollywood premiere have already seen the film and while full reviews are under embargo until December 12th, early reactions have hit social media. The movie will finally premiere in theatres on Friday December 15th, but Mark Ellis and Perri Nemiroff were lucky enough to attend the Saturday event.

Yesterday at Comic Con Experience 2017 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Warner Bros. revealed its upcoming slate of movies from DC Films. While there were questions about Warner Bros and DC after a number of shake ups happened after the disappointing returns on Justice League, it appears DC is moving full steam ahead. The studio announced with title cards Wonder Woman 2, Flashpoint, Justice League Dark, Green Lantern Corp, Suicide Squad 2, Batgirl and The Batman.

BOX OFFICE REPORT

BUY OR SELL

A new trailer has been released for Ready Player One, the highly anticipated sci-fi adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg. The film follows Wade Watts played by Tye Sheridan who joins a worldwide contest to find an Easter egg hidden in the OASIS by its creator.

The first trailer for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse landed online this past weekend following its premiere at the Comic-Con Experience in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The movie features Shameik Moore of Netflix’s The Get Down as the voice of Miles Morales, the young African-American man who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man in Brian Michael Bendis‘ run of comics.

We wanted to check out the Christmas decoration situation, was Christmas finally over?? As we were walking around the parks doing our usual park and ride updates we noticed this car building set in the Fast & Furious gift shop and realized that there were other sets themed to other rides like Jurassic Park and Transformers. So we went on a toy hunt to see if any other attractions had them too. They didn't :( but it was fun to check out the other gift shops and see some of the new to us ride merch. We also checked out Hogsmeade and talked a little bit about some Celebration of Harry Potter rumors and thoughts. Then we walked over to Jurassic Park and met a raptor! That's always really fun and we highly recommend checking it out when you're in the park. As we were leaving we saw some ride and attraction themed candy bars that were pretty cool! We hope you enjoyed today's Universal vlog, but be sure to let us know in the comments down below if there's something you'd like to see us do! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

All Hail Curiosity!

Consider the fact that right now, there’s an SUV-sized rover crawling around the surface of Mars, zapping rocks with its laser, scooping and sampling material, and generally giving us the best view we’ve ever seen from the surface of the Red Planet.

NASA’s Curiosity Rover has been on the surface of Mars since 2012, following the story of water. When did it first show up on Mars, and was it there long enough to support the biology of life?

In its 5 years and counting of exploration, Curiosity has pushed our understanding of the Red Planet forward, and paved the way for the next generation of gigantic, nuclear powered rovers headed to Mars to search for life itself.

Judging from their responses to her questions, it looks like we’ll be getting a complex “villain” dealing with his pursuit of the Infinity Stones and confronting these familial relationships in Gamora and Nebulah. They spoke about his motivations, his challenges and what kind of “villain” we should expect to see from Thanos during the course of these two movies.

John Rocha and Perri Nemiroff are here to talk about the article and explore these quotes from Markus and McFeely. They offer their thoughts on what stands out to them about the screenwriters’ approach to the character of Thanos and if they like this approach to the character.

ABOUT THE FOUR
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant

Many of us grew up with the magical Harry Potter franchise and there’s nothing that quite compares to it. The worlds that were created both in the books and the screen were beyond our wildest dreams. But as perfect as these films seem, they are not free from error. We have compiled a list of some pretty hilarious bloopers throughout several films. Are you ready for a giggle?

The cast became friends over a decade of filming together and they were all a bunch of hilarious high energy people. Did you know that The fourth installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire had a hilarious blooper? Amid the trials, there was also a dance. Which turns out is not Daniel Radcliffe’s strong suit. In a blooper we get to see Daniel Radcliffe mess up his dancing. It’s adorable and we get to see them have fun. Radcliffe jokingly said he is actually a champion dancer, he was merely pretending to be bad because Harry is supposed to be a bad dancer.

Emma Watson admitted that she did one of the most Hermione Granger things anyone could ever do. In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, that she caused issues because used to ruin takes when she would mouth Rupert and Daniel’s lines along with them. She was so perfect for this role don’t you think? Hermione would be so proud.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z13-YvZZibA/sddefault.jpg,0.007904510459715195,0.00025921474556317946,30.494061757719717,0.0003460301354073797,0.008163725205278376,0.008509755340685755,2017-11-16,09:35:00,Thursday,3,9,38,9,33,64,334,4,79,0,1,8,14,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.3019904890172285,3,"['happy', 'happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,2,0,0,1,"{'chair': 1, 'tie': 1, 'person': 3}",5

BULLSHIT. Absolute BULLSHIT. I hope the board and ROTH Capital Partners suffer every possible financial windfall they have coming. This happened because of the people at the top, especially CEO Dave Von Dorman. Or at least that's what he'd like to be known as, but his real name is Dave Dohrmann, and you can read all about him here: 

http://davedohrmann.blogspot.com/

ALLEGEDLY. Hey, look, maybe she made it all up, but I doubt it. I watched him be a total douchebag to Agent Pilot on a live stream and carry himself like he was a fucking GOD any chance he could put himself in the picture so I believe every word of it. How about you do the right thing Dave and pay your employees? It's not their fault YOU failed. But you can take your ball and go home right? Leave them hanging. This video probably won't accomplish anything but I still have to say it.

Continuing the planet’s long-term warming trend, globally averaged temperatures in 2017 were 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.90 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1951 to 1980 mean, according to scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. That is second only to global temperatures in 2016. Last year was the third consecutive year in which temperatures were more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) above late nineteenth-century levels.

NASA’s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations.

These raw measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the conclusions. These calculations produce the global average temperature deviations from the baseline period of 1951 to 1980.

The full 2017 surface temperature data set and the complete methodology used to make the temperature calculation are available at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.

GISS is a laboratory within the Earth Sciences Division of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The laboratory is affiliated with Columbia University’s Earth Institute and School of Engineering and Applied Science in New York.

NASA uses the unique vantage point of space to better understand Earth as an interconnected system. The agency also uses airborne and ground-based monitoring, and develops new ways to observe and study Earth with long-term data records and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing. NASA shares this knowledge with the global community and works with institutions in the United States and around the world that contribute to understanding and protecting our home planet.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z4bSxb5THm4/sddefault.jpg,0.0015450608173268028,0.00011752140444991341,13.147058823529413,0.0007085849385950662,0.0016625822217767165,0.0023711671603717822,2018-01-18,16:12:47,Thursday,3,7,7,7,7,46,63,0,16,0,0,1,0,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.8887847827016655,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'vase': 1},1

Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.

“Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, with Angela Bassett, with Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis.

We all know that Jimmy Kimmel’s ‘Mean Tweets’ segment is usually centered around celebrities reading mean tweets about themselves. However, in honor of Jimmy’s 50th birthday, the show’s cast and crew surprised the birthday boy with a special Mean Tweets edition featuring mean tweets…about Jimmy.
Stars like Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence, Kristin Bell, as well as Jimmy’s current and former late night peers like Stephen Colbert and David Letterman got in on the fun.
However, nothing and I mean nothing was better than when Kim K read a mean tweet about Jimmy, written by her hubby, Kanye West.
Whoa, way harsh, Kanye. If you don’t remember, Yay feuded with Jimmy back in 2013 after Jimmy mocked one of Kanye’s interviews and this specific tweet that Kim read was one of the ones that came from Kanye’s glorious rant. The two have since made up and are obviously on good terms ish.
But anyway, as mean as that tweet was, Yeezy’s message doesn’t really compare to some of the other ones Jimmy got. Like this one read by Larry David.
Or this tweet that Will Ferrell had the honor of reading.
Ouch. Well, happy birthday Jimmy!

We're finally getting a chance to try out the 2018 Tesla Model 3, the long-awaited solution to Tesla's biggest problem: It sells cars that most people can't afford. The Model 3 is thus poised to shift Tesla down from hallowed, aspirational startup to legitimate, skeptic-free corporate success.

That's a lot to demand from a single, $35,000 car. While my first impressions behind the wheel of the Model 3 made it clear the car was going to be good, there's one problem already: The car you're looking at actually costs $56,500. That mean it's no longer a competitor of the $37,495 Chevrolet Bolt EV and instead has been elevated up into the range of a nicely equipped BMW 3 Series -- or even a base 530e.

Spoiler alert: it's great, but it isn't perfect.

Michael Wolff is an American author, essayist, journalist, and a columnist and contributor to USA Today. He has received two National Magazine Awards, a Mirror Award, and has authored seven books. In January 2018, Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was published, containing unflattering descriptions of behaviour by U.S. President Donald Trump, chaotic interactions among the White House senior staff, and derogatory comments about the Trump family by former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. After being released on January 5, the book quickly became a New York Times number one bestseller.

Tom's even got a book about his lifestyle. The TB12 Method details Tom's personal philosophies which he credits to his success on and off the football field. A major part of that is what he eats, so here's a look at what the dinner table looks like in the Brady household…

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

Hanging in there for the last few weeks of school. I have been sick for almost a week now, and it takes a toll on my concentration.. I've taken 3 different days off of class or left early, and it makes me stressed out because I have to suffer the consequences for it later!

The same goes with editing, I was really hoping to make an April favorites, (I rarely do sit-down talking videos but I want to more it's so fun), and this month I finally have gathered enough products I actually like and can share. I normally stay in the same old habits and have the same products you already know about, but I want to explore more nowadays! It will also give the chance to hear from you any recommendations.

It's been an exact month since I returned from this spring vacation, and I finally pushed out all of the footage into vlogs! Thank you so much for being here, reading this, and experiencing our memories. It's a pleasure to be able to share these moments, and I am grateful for that everyday.

so I ordered $15 worth of porridge last weekend (Chinese households, porridge is a staple when you are ill!) and it really hydrates you to pee away all the toxins. But yesterday, I bought a small bag of rice from CVS and attempted to use Tyler's rice cooker just now to make some porridge.. If you think about it, a $7 bag of rice has over 50 servings, and I spent $15 for take out for just 4 servings 😰😪 but it's ok... supporting local family businesses!! lol.

I am unfamiliar with Tyler's rice cooker's settings, so perhaps I put too much rice & water because it cooked the porridge and overflowed and exploded everywhere............. but 70% of it remained inside the pot so I salvaged it!! win some, and lose some.

really hope you take care, take the time and energy to love yourself. I will look forward to filming the April favorites video, even if it's already May, I hope that's okay.. Let me know your thoughts and any comments, it is a delight to read. Love you.

Best,
Annabelle

so who has seen pitch perfect 3? I have and let me tell you I am angry, they didn't include the bechloe kiss. I’m particularly angry in learning that Anna Kendrick had to force to allow the kiss to be filmed because they didn’t want to, I’m also angry that she had to repeatedly say no to kissing Theo as she knew if she did even one take of it they’d include it in the film. I’m angry that the girls had to fight so hard for this. Universal even told Anna and britt that the kiss was going to to be in the film and that’s why they agreed to film the almost kiss for promotion as they believed they were going to be canon. So please don’t confuse your anger and hurt and project it towards the girls do it instead to universal who definitely deserve. Despite all the anger I’m feeling I’m feeling mostly sad that after following bechloe for five years the didn’t include the kiss or any real bechloe scene in the third, like seriously there’s less bechloe in the third than the other two!! Anyway please enjoy the video, I got quite emotional editing it as I don’t know when we’re next going to get Anna and britt together as the press tour is now over:(((


I am doing a “all bechloe moments in pp3” as soon as I can find a copy of the film yet I doubt it will honestly be longer than 3 Minutes.


I hope you’ve all had a good 2017, I most certainly haven’t lol.

The device comes in a variety of sizes, ranging from as small as 5 inches to a model that is 7ft in diameter. 

Guardbot is fitted with two surveillance cameras, a batter that can last for 25 hours, microphones and GPS, allowing it to be controlled via satellites as well as remotely. 

It's currently still in development and the military are looking into using it for future deployments.

Could Guardbot be the future of mobile surveillance?

Having transformed the way billions of people consume and share news online, in some cases the way news organisations produce it, Facebook now wants to replace news with more content from friends and family.

Venturing into the news business has brought Facebook revenues but also a boatload of trouble. The platform has been blamed for the spread of fake news, misinformation and hateful content online.

News publishers even changed their business models to max out on Facebook as a way to get to audiences. But the platform's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is batting away his critics, saying he's doing right by the people who matter most to him - his users.

""Up until now, Facebook has kind of been doing a push towards more media content on their news feed. They've been pushing for video, and a lot of different publishers have been creating video that's specifically for Facebook,"" explains Surya Mattu, engineer and data reporter at Gizmodo.

""From what it sounds like they're going to change that now by devaluing what publishers are doing and kind of promoting what family and friends are saying.""

However, critics speculate the CEOs announcement is simply a business decision.

""Facebook is a business, it's a publicly traded company,"" says Sue Halpern, writer and scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College. ""Every announcement that Mark Zuckerberg makes is a business decision. And another motivating factor is that they're losing the demographic battle. Younger people are much less engaged with Facebook than ever before.""
The changes to Facebook's news feed will have a far greater effect on news producers than consumers. Consider the lengths publishers have gone to in order to make their material work on the platform.

""It's gotten a lot of publishers really freaked out,"" said Alan Wolk, a leading TV industry analyst. ""Publishers had really gotten to a point where the vast majority of them were getting their traffic from social media...And too many of them have gone into a habit where they're creating news stories and just basing their whole business model on driving traffic from Facebook.""

The relationship that news organisations had with Facebook was always ""complicated"". Now, having been given notice of being de-emphasised in the news feed, they have a right to feel aggrieved and fearful of what the future holds.

Whether Zuckerberg's recent announcement truly aims to counter misinformation or actually succeed in tackling hateful content online, it's clear the company is under attack from both sides of the Atlantic.

""Facebook and a lot of the other tech companies were called to account by the United States Congress among other legislative bodies around the world...so there's you know great incentive on the part of Facebook to do something,"" says Halpern.

""The fact is that Facebook changes their algorithm all the time, but they don't always make an announcement about it. So the fact that they made an announcement about it is probably a response to that very challenge.""

The coming changes to the news feed will be significant, but they won't fix Facebook's fake news problem.

News stories will still be on the site. It's just that they won't originate in the news feed. Users will post stories that will then be shared. And given what we know about social media ecosystems, news bubbles and comfort zones - fake news will still find audiences.

Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is drafted against her will to become a “sparrow,” a trained seductress in the Russian security service. Dominika learns to use her body as a weapon, but struggles to maintain her sense of self during the dehumanizing training process. Finding her power in an unfair system, she emerges as one of the program’s strongest assets. Her first target is Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), a CIA officer who handles the agency’s most sensitive infiltration of Russian intelligence. The two young operatives fall into a spiral of attraction and deception, which threatens their careers, allegiances and the security of both countries. 

Based on the book by former CIA officer Jason Matthews, “Red Sparrow” reunites Jennifer Lawrence with her “Hunger Games” director, Francis Lawrence with Joel Edgerton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Charlotte Rampling, Jeremy Irons, and Mary Louise Parker rounding out the cast.

This is part 1, which continues where the last Hard Knock TV interview with Logic left off: at The Grammys. Logic details all the behind the scenes including people wanting him to change his speech, toasting Jay Z and getting acknowledgement from Kendrick Lamar, who he still hasn't met yet. Logic still doesn't feel that he is accepted in Hip Hop but has now come to terms with the fact that one can't fit in and stand out at the same time. Logic goes on to share how he keeps perspective in the midst of all his success and the material wealth that comes with it. Logic calls Bobby Tarantino 2 Conscious Trap and says that although he indulges in the braggadocio part of rap he still keeps balance by being self-aware and introspective. This is just the beginning of our interview!! Make sure to subscribe to www.youtube.com/hardknocktv to be the first to be notified when part 2 of Logic's and Nick's conversation goes live.

Lyrics:

The river shows no mercy
The tower looms into my view
I sense my execution's closing
With darkness all around me
The axe is ground to end my days
The raven's cry proclaims repentance

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Into the storm
I'm gonna win
Killer of sin
Saved by the traitors gate

A man betrayed for treason
I only wanted what was right
To bring a purpose by rebellion
The storm is soon arriving
And rain will wash away my blood
This walk of death will bring survival

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Ready to die
Carry the day
Bury the lie
Tear down the traitors gate

Forgive me for my sins
I meant no harm to you
So let the axe man fall
To justify what I begin

Where will you be tomorrow
Now they've removed this mortal coil
I hope and pray I bring you freedom
For honour God and country
This world can be a better place
As I ascend from my conviction

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
River of blood
Turning the tide
Cause of the flood
Destroying the traitors gate

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Losing my head
Blunt of the axe
Alive when I'm dead
Escape from the traitors gate",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZGJtMrVbqdg/sddefault.jpg,0.009613534008237423,0.0001828399861426537,52.57894736842106,0.001352053581739097,0.009796373994380077,0.011148427576119174,2018-03-09,13:25:17,Friday,4,3,1,3,1,26,9,1,4,0,0,3,1,0,0,8.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5908719952967205,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Hooters Air launched in 2003, but closed about three years later. The company cited a number of reasons for the airline's failure, including a $40 million loss. But in the short time that Hooters Air existed, it made a major economic impact on one city in particular — Myrtle Beach, South Carolina — that's where the airline was headquartered, and where it brought thousands of tourists every week.

We talked to people who worked for Hooters Air — flight attendants and one pilot (who asked to remain anonymous). They told us what it was really like to work for the airline (which featured two Hooters Girls on every flight) and dispelled some common misperceptions about what it was like to fly it. Hooters declined to comment for this story.

This is ep 85 of the Aunty Donna podcast.
You can find our podcast on omny, planet broadcasting, spotify, itunes and/or any good podcast app. (We have 100% deliberately avoided all bad podcast apps)

In this video Mark, Zach and Broden read comments from the first two tracks from Aunty Donna - The Ablum; Chuffed (Dad Song) and Professor Whiskers.

What is the difference between a filmed podcast and a vlog? A filmed podcast can be a normal podcast but vlog cannot be a normal podcast, unless of course it can be normal podcast. A filmed podcast and a vlog are both youtube videos but a filmed podcast cannot be a vlog unless it is one. Nothing is sacred anymore.

So Never ASK ALEXA These Questions You Will Regret It and do not ask me why this is truly a don't ask don't tell situation. Here we see why Alexa recording everything so don't ask don't tell for this Amazon Alexa hacks. personally, I think the is what not to say to Alexa because it can get scary at times.

WHY?
When Alexa is asked questions that she does not understand, she responds and responds: “Sorry, I can’t find an answer to the question I heard.” However, in this case, the ring light around the device disappears, and it turns off, and the device fails to provide any response.

I do not know if this is crazy or what but I think there is something behind this. Now I have no problem with safety, but I personally would like to be notified and not have them record my voice without my information. To me, this is not right.

After making a name for herself at Fox News, Megyn Kelly was courted by NBC and offered a reported $23 million per year to bring her star power to the Peacock Network. This made her the highest-paid anchor at NBC, but unfortunately, courting Kelly may not have been the best investment. In September 2017, the network gave her a daily talk show-style gig during the 9 a.m. slot of the Today show, called Megyn Kelly Today. The show failed to bring in viewers and ratings plummeted, fueled by countless controversies. Let's take a closer look at some of the reasons Megyn Kelly's morning show has been a bit of a disaster...

AKA Justin liked the picture, thus showing the world that he totally loves his back on girlfriend’s hair. Obviously we all know Selena does not need anyone’s approval. Girlfriend is an independent woman and she is owning who she is. That said, I think she looks smokin’ hot and so totally cool. And clearly the Biebs agrees based on the ground-breakign fact that he liked SG’s Instagram pic. But obviously he’s not alone because millions of other people did the same, including me, everyone I know and also Kim Kardashian. We love that Kim liked this pic because (duh) she’s the kween of brunettes going blonde flawlessly. Speaking of flawlessness, can I please give Selena major props for something that actually matters – aka her incredible performance at the AMAs of her song Wolves with Marshmellow. Safe to say she’s been through a lot this year and I think it’s so inspiring to see how much she’s overcome. But like, her hair looks great too. What do you guys think? Are you like me and considering bleaching your locks or maybe buying a wig??? Hit the comments section to let us know. I’m your girl Joslyn Davis at Clevver headquarters thanks for hanging and we’ll see you later!

I don't have proper editing software for all the cool pan and zoom features, so this looks extremely lazy, I'm sorry.
But I REALLY wanted to do the boneless meme with... well, Boneless. lol

There are actually a lot of memes that I wanna do but I can't because without the pan and zoom features it just looks unfinished and stupid. Like the Fantasize meme and the Otterpop meme, I wanna do those but I can't. cri

LYRICS

Step outside in the midnight rain,
King n' queen of the streets again,
Got young blood running through our veins,
And it keeps us numb like Novocain

Alright,
We can go all night,
Cause we got a whole lot of fight in us,
And I see a long road,
That we gotta follow,
Before tomorrow,
Catches up

Oh, just take it easy,
Hold onto this feeling,
All our friends are leaving,
And we ain't got where to go,
Caught up in the afterglow

“Can't stay here but ya can't go home,”
Did you hear that line somewhere before?
And you look just fine on your own,
But we look better in the afterglow

Alright,
We can go all night,
Cause we got a whole lot of fight in us,
And I see a long road,
That we gotta follow,
Before tomorrow,
Catches up

Oh, just take it easy,
Hold onto this feeling,
All our friends are leaving,
But we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow,
We ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow,

Oh, just take it easy,
Hold onto this feeling,
No we don’t need a reason
Cause we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow

When the lights go down,
Come find me in the afterglow,
Waiting to be found,
I'll meet you in the afterglow
When the lights go down,
Come find me in the afterglow,

Apple has made these repairs extraordinarily difficult. But where there is a will there is a way. Remember I DO NOT recommend attempting any of the repairs shown in this video on your own iPhone. The chance of failure is SUPER high, and you can thank apple for that.  Here is a BETTER way to remove the glass: https://youtu.be/Lj4Od9D4puc

iPhone 8 Plus Back Glass: https://amzn.to/2qVT0rA
iPhone 8 Back Glass: https://amzn.to/2qTHvSg
iPhone X Back Glass: https://amzn.to/2qUe5SY

I show a few different ways to repair a New cracked glass iPhone. The first is with a refrigerant that can be purchased on Amazon called tetrafluoroethane. (https://amzn.to/2K7RGum)  This almost worked... But still wasn't cold enough. I then tried using Liquid Nitrogen to repair the back glass on my iPhone 8. This took about 10 minutes. BUT liquid nitrogen is not as easy to get a hold of. 

iPhone 8 plus Camera lens: https://amzn.to/2HoaKqs
iPhone 8 camera lens: https://amzn.to/2qU1HmR
B-7000 adhesive: https://amzn.to/2HmJubX

Finally I try using heat to remove and replace the back glass on the iPhone 8 plus. This took about a half hour. But was extremely difficult. Holding a phone that has been heated to 350 degrees F, is super dangerous not only to your hands, house, and desk, but to your phone as well. The phone is not designed to be heated to that temperature.

Apple charges CRAZY amounts for out of warranty repairs on these phones. If you dont have insurance, it is 399 dollars to repair your iPhone 8 plus, and over 500 dollars to repair your iPhone 10. Highway robbery right there. 

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you want to see a Dry Ice attempt at repairing the iPhone 10 I have left.

In case you missed, Keaton became a viral sensation yesterday when his heart melting video took over the internet. A GoFundME called “Stand up for Keaton” was created to support him and his family and it quickly racked up nearly 60-thousand-dollars. BUT after photos of his family emerged holding the confederate flag the money raising was put on halt. I should note that Keaton’s mom, Kimberly didn’t actually start the fundraising page herself. It was a man that says he has nothing to do with the family and only wants to help Keaton. BUT Keaton’s mom apparently also started her own GoFundMe page to supposedly raise money to buy Keaton gifts for the holidays. According to TMZ, this account was shut down by GoFundMe due to fraud concerns.

All of this said, Kimberly spoke out in regards to her social media posts with the Confederate flag.

""It was meant to be ironic and funny and extreme.  I am genuinely truly sorry. If I could take it back I would.""

""I mean that, you know, yesterday he was a hero. You know, the world loved us. Today, the world hates us.”

Alright everyone this is a tough situation. But, and again, we don’t know all the facts, but I would be personally shocked to find out Keaton was not being bullied. I do 100% believe that he’s been a victim of bullying and I think that’s what everyone needs to focus on because that’s what we can control in the world around us. That said, if you see someone else being bullied please stand up and say something. IF you’re being bullied please don’t be afraid to ask for help.

With all this in mind, what are your reactions to this on-going story? Hit the comments to join this conversation and then click here to see that inspiring rally of support Keaton received yesterday! I’m Joslyn Davis at Clevver headquarters thanks for watching and we’ll see you later!

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!
To make this Winter Hat Cake, I baked 6 lbs of my Ultimate Chocolate Cake, and 5 lbs of my Ultimate Vanilla Cake dyed PINK. I iced the cake with Italian Buttercream as usual - and then I draped it in sweet knitted fondant details made with Marvelous Molds knit molds! And to top it all off, I added a pretty pom pom!
Got an idea for a cake? I'd love to hear it - subscribe & comment below!

Whether you’re using both AirPods or just one, the W1 chip automatically routes the audio and engages the microphone. And when you’re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and focus on the sound of your voice. Because the ultralow-power W1 chip manages battery life so well, AirPods deliver an industry-leading 5 hours of listening time on one charge.

The variable aperture lens is cool. But when you compare photos from the S9, keep aperture number in mind. (Don't compare low light F2.4 photos with low light F1.5 photos)

Other phones like the iPhone X and the Pixel 2 XL have very wide apertures as well!

WHATSUP GUYS! Name's Gabe. I post videos every Friday. In this weeks video I talked about 'The Worst Black Friday Deals.' It is a big tradition in America for people to go out the day after Thanksgiving and go crazy over $50 off or even $5 off, but this video is about the WORST deals. As always make sure to subscribe for more funny videos to come!

The moment I saw it announced pre-CES, I knew I needed to get my hands on one. This laptop will be used for an upcoming trial that I have later this year on the East Coast. My current laptop is a MacBook that I have been using as a lower power / Mac in a Windows world test. And while it's been working out quite well, this next big trial is one where I don't really think it would look good if I showed up with a gold MacBook.

Things I like so far about the Dell XPS 13 2018 is the screen. It feels even more ""infinity"" this year, with the screen seeming more flush with the top lid - very Macbook-like. And overall, the entire laptop still feels tough while being thinner and lighter than before. I also like the three USB-C ports.

Things I don't like so far about the Dell XPS 13 2018 is that there isn't at least one USB-A port. And while I appreciate the card slot, it's micro SD. I would have preferred standard SD size. 

It has an 8th gen core i7, which I haven't really had full opportunity to put through it's paces yet, but I am very excited to work with this potent little beast.

With season 2 coming back, here are the things we want to see in the second season of The Handmaid's Tale! We want to know Janine’s fate. Will she be executed or will she be allowed to live? We also also want to see June’s mother. After all, the show is about women’s oppression. Where else could a voice like June’s mother’s be more useful? She’d stand in stark contrast to Serena Joy, and be a reminder that there were plenty of people opposed to Gilead’s authority. How about Aunt Lydia? There’s gotta be a bigger and deeper backstory and we’re dying to know!

[Intro: Sia]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Sia]
One foot in front of the other babe
One breath leads to another yeah
Just keep moving, oh
Look within for the strength today
Listen out for the voice to say
Just keep moving, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this

[Chorus: Sia]
So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh, my love, don't stop running
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames

[Verse 2: Sia]
Don't stop, tomorrow's another day
Don't stop, tomorrow you'll feel no pain
Just keep moving
Don't stop the past'll trip you up
You know, right now's gotta be enough
Just keep moving

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this

[Chorus: Sia]
So my love, keep on running
You gotta get trough today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh, my love, don't stop running
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames

[Bridge: Sia]
In flames
In flames
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this

[Chorus: Sia]
So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
Then my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh, my love, don't stop running
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZS5UjhOQTxA/sddefault.jpg,0.03239816893252493,0.00016720780388929516,193.75990939977348,0.00045466131046228514,0.03256537673641422,0.03302003804687651,2018-06-05,04:39:32,Tuesday,1,8,39,8,34,56,343,2,79,0,1,6,18,1,0,6.0,8.0,['Porn|'],['Porn|'],True,['porn|'],1,1,5,0,0,0,0,6.596485359307637,2,"['neutral', 'sad']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"{'car': 1, 'person': 2}",3

About the award:

For the 1927/28 Academy awards, the award was for engineering effects. There was no award again until 1938 where it was called a special award ""for outstanding achievement in creating special photographic and sound effects. The very next year the award was combined with sound effects and called the Award for Special Effects. It wasn't until 1963 that the award became the Award for Best Visual Effects (which it is still called today). It was given every year from 1963 to present, with the exception of 1973.

Get a unique tour of some of the world’s most unusual networks, led by a Cuban hacker

Internet access in Cuba is notoriously restrictive. ETECSA, the government-run teleco, offers 60 wireless hotspots in parks and hotels, allowing foreigners and citizens alike to ""visit"" the Internet for only $1/hour… That’s what most tourists know about the Internet in Cuba, but of course, that can't be the whole story!

In this talk, we'll take a deeper look at what life is like for Cuban hackers, and we’ll get to tour a vibrant set of community-driven networks that typical tourists never see. The story that emerges is an inspiring view of what communities can (and can’t) accomplish in the face of adversity.


Internet access in Cuba is a study in resilience. By the official numbers, the island seems hopelessly disconnected: Cuba ranked last in the Americas in the ITU’s 2016 ICT development index, having only 5.6% household Internet penetration, and international bandwidth per user measures a mere 572 bits/s. Yet Cubans have developed a number of bottom-up, community-oriented responses to these limitations.

This talk will focus on three indigenous networks that aren't seen by the typical tourist. These include “El Paquete”, a sneaker-net distribution of media files that’s passed around the country on USB sticks and hard drives, and which may be Cuba’s largest source of private employment. There is also the Cuban educational network, which connects more than 20 higher education institutions around the country. Perhaps most unusual is Havana’s “Street Network”, or SNET, a vast unsanctioned IP network, constructed by volunteers using salvaged equipment. Though entirely isolated from the Internet, the SNET connects over 50,000 residential users across the capital city, and it’s home to a vibrant community and hundreds of websites.

In describing these three systems, we'll draw lessons about what is necessary for network communities to survive and thrive in the island’s challenging environment, including places where flexibility and compromise have been essential. Cuba presents a highly unusual regulatory and technological environment, and the approaches that have succeeded there are both inspiring and demonstrative of what communities can (and can't) accomplish through organic, distributed networks.

-MATILDA
This feline also known as The Algonquin cat represents a historical figure in the luxurious, elegant and traditional Algonquin Hotel located in Manhattan, New York.

-STEWIE
Despite all the members of this Top, we cannot use the phrase ""the biggest cat in the world"" without mentioning this feline.

And it seems that the felines have taken over Instagram as their second home. With more than 170 thousand followers in his account, Samson has come to fame as the biggest cat in all of New York City.

-OMAR
In Melbourne, a cat is trying to snatch the title of the largest cat, Ludo. This is Omar, an Australian Maine Coon who has become famous on its own in Instagram.

-LUDO
You can’t talk about big cats without mentioning the Maine Coons. Kelsey Gill originally wanted a cat only similar to the one that appears in the Harry Potter films; however, over time she realized that her cat was not very common.

-ARCTURUS
At just 2 years of age, this savannah cat has already broken the record for the world's tallest cat reaching 19.05 inches in height and weighing around 30 pounds.

-SCARLETT'S MAGIC
This species of savannah had the record of the tallest cat measuring at first 16.5 inches, however, a year later it would reach more than 18 inches breaking its own mark.

-ZEUS
When you were younger, didn’t you want to have a tiger pet? Well, Zeus is pretty close to that. Living a well-off life with its owner Morgan Lynn known for its YouTube channel Spotted Exotic this serval looks like an ordinary pet.

-SPRINKLES
A few years ago an obese cat from New Jersey caught the attention of many when it was reported as the heaviest in all of North America and possibly the world, too.

-TIMO
This ragdoll is popular for its YouTube channel, Xiedubbel, where you can see its daily life as the lazy and playful cat that it is.

It seems it will never end…but the end is in sight.” Words from Andrés Iniesta as tt was the captain’s 38th Clásico and he took full advantage to savour the moment of this final game against Real Madrid in a Barça shirt. The Barça number 8 played 58 minutes before being replaced to a standing ovation in the second half. The 2-2 draw was the final result in his personal collection which includes 9 other draw, 16 wins and 12 defeats in all his appearances against the blaugranes’ biggest rivals.

In that time he also scored three goals and created six assists and put in some memorable performances in unforgettable encounters such as the 6-2 win in the Bernabéu, the 5-0 win at Camp Nou and the 4-0 win away which included a trademark Iniesta strike which will always be remembered as his last in a Clásico.

This week i was in New York and had the pleasure to work in Jimmy Direstas Shop. Hope you enjoy the video. This lamp obviously needs an earth cable to make it safe because it is all metal. I simply didn`t have the right cable and there was no time to buy it because we only had 2 days in the shop. so if you want to build a lamp like this, make sure it is earthed!!

CHORUS

I seek trends
Trading on the weekend
You got weak hands
I got a killer streak man

BTC trader
Market shaker      
Coin curator
Price dictator

VERSE

You just blew your whole account, mine has nine lives
I been hunting all the stops, I been catching all the knives
You struggle with the dips, I can manage just fine
and you're never gonna get a killer entry like mine
Some are bulls or bears, I'm only here to get paid
I'm racking up the numbers I don't care either way
The bitcoin game is a motherfucking arms race
I log into my bitmex and fuck all your mom's on Coinbase

With my Winklevii eye I spy a great buy
got that pumping premonition, I don't even gotta try
I’m that BTC OG UC?
Dimon talked a lot of shit then he bought his coins from me
this markets 24/7 and I'm right on time
got an ROI so nasty that it's probably a crime
I'm like a prophet with an f, I'm taking everyone's deposit
but these idiots just keep on selling right into my pockets

CHORUS

I seek trends

Trading on the weekend
You got weak hands
I got a killer streak man

BTC trader
market shaker
coin curator
price dictator

VERSE
After a nine month confirmation time
Coindaddy came to earth, with thoughts of moon up in his mind.
I was born in San Francisco with a Trezor in my hand
Put my wealth into the bits, and then watched that shit expand

Coin Nation, we got tokens of every flavor
Coin Nation, aint nothin thout’ the traders

From the Holders to the Scalpers checkin up on minute candles
Daddy Inc. got baller traders stacking coins up for thier Lambos
Got the Blockchain in my bones, got that Crypto in my blood
Im a minute I'll be rubbing out a long on Asian Corn Hub TM

Coindaddy run the Cryptonati leaving you disabled   
I’m eating all the filet, you eat scraps under the table
I’m holding all these bitcoins until they’re a million and stable
Fuckin’ crypto THOTs in the bathroom, I’ll wash my hands later

With my winkle vie eye I spy no lie. 
I’ll let DR. DA give us a piece up of his mind. 

CHORUS

I seek trends

Trading on the weekend
You got weak hands
I got a killer streak man

Gross, but curable.",panch0dawg,10.0,2018-06-03 16:32:28+00:00,"['cat lungworm', 'cat hairball', 'hairball', 'cat coughing', 'lungworm', 'cat asthma', 'feline asthma', 'feline lungworm']",64105.0,233.0,14.0,80.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZY8NR9pdJL4/default.jpg,"This is a video of my cat coughing due to lungworms. Keep reading (show more) for the steps the vet took and medication the vet prescribed to completely cure her. She's happy and healthy now and doesn't cough at all anymore.

We adopted her from a shelter at about 7 months old and don't really know what her history is before that — whether she was found outside or what. When she would cough like this I initially thought she was trying to cough up a hairball although she never produced one, but when she had a separate episode of rapid breathing I called my vet. I took this video (and others) to show my vet because I wasn't sure what coughing looked like vs a hairball. She said this is definitely coughing (from the lungs) and not a hairball (which is really vomiting from the stomach).

She thought it might be kitty asthma from my description, but opted to treat her with Panacur for parasites (lungworms) and antibiotics to rule out any bacterial infection first. We also made an appointment for an x-ray. The x-ray showed the ""lines and doughnuts"" indicative of inflamed airways. The vet said for a young cat this was definitely not something she would expect to see. 

After about a week on the Panacur and antibiotics I began to see fewer coughing episodes. The vet drew blood and did labs that showed an elevated white blood count with elevated eosinophils, which she said would be indicative of parasites/lungworms. If it was lungworms with continued treatment of the Panacur for 10 days we should see the eosinophils go down when we repeated the blood work. I also applied her monthly topical Revolution treatment which works against fleas, heartworm, roundworm and other parasites including lungworm. 

The repeat bloodwork did show that her eosinophil levels were going back down toward the normal range and she has had no more coughing episodes. This means this was most likely lungworms. Sometimes vets can pick it up when they test the poop for parasites, but depending on the stage of life of the lungworm they can't always see anything in the poop. My kitty's poop had checked out fine. 

Overall, as gross as lungworms sound, I was really happy that's what she had instead of Feline Asthma. Lungworms are readily curable. She had to have 10 days of Panacur and we are keeping her on Revolution and that's it. If it was Feline Asthma it's a chronic condition which would require lifelong meds. So yay for lungworms?

I wanted to put this video up to help people who might be searching for why their cat is coughing. I watched a lot of YouTube videos trying to figure it out. 

Cat lungworms can be contracted only through consuming the larva or eggs somehow — through drinking infected water in some cases or, I think more commonly (not sure, not a scientist) eating infected slugs or snails or through eating birds/rodents that have eaten infected slugs or snails. There are 2 or 3 different varieties of lungworms. We live in the southeast US where one kind is not that uncommon. The vet assured me that they are not contagious between cats, or between cats and dogs, or cats and humans. So before we adopted our kitty she must have consumed the lungworm larvae somehow.

Which “Pretty Little Liars” cast member is doing jail time? Which actress seemed thrilled with the end of the show? Which cast member lied about their age to get the part? Which character is going to die in the first episode of the spin-off, “The Perfectionists?” We found answers to these questions and so much more.  

“Pretty Little Liars” kept fans guessing for 7 sinister seasons. The show seemed to have everything, mystery, murder, and manipulative hotties. We were able to unearth some pretty delicious gossip about this popular t.v. show that might shock you even more than the big plot reveals and twists. If you loved Sasha Pieterse in “PLL,” you’re not going to want to miss this video. There are some interesting reveals about Shay Mitchell and Lucy Hale too. Stay tuned to the end to discover the truth about the spin-off that was just exposed. It’s too juicy!

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

It seems like everything that Beyoncé does is fabulous, and that includes the way she raises her children. Blue Ivy Carter is the firstborn child of Beyoncé and Jay-Z, and as such, she has the strictest rules to follow. Simply showing up in a school bus is not for her, and public school is something she will never experience. It’s only a matter of time before her siblings, twins Rumi and Sir, get their own stylists for when they’re ready to walk out onto the red carpet. Sure, the kids have nannies, but even they have to follow an amazingly strict set of rules that Beyoncé came up with herself. Let us know what you think of the rules set down by Beyonce and Jay-Z in the comment section, and don’t forget to click subscribe to get the latest videos from TheTalko.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

The world is changing so quickly that only one show seems to be keeping up. Black Mirror follows the breakneck trends in technology and presents us with a believable and nerve-wracking future. The cautionary tales of this anthology series feel so real and strangely relatable, it’s almost as if we’re looking at ourselves in the present. That’s probably because much of the technological advancements, cybersecurity threats, and evolved social behaviors are occurring right now in our own reality. So ScreenRant is going through the unbelievable tales of this modern day Twilight Zone and unveiling 10 things from Black Mirror that are already happening.

Google is giving us self-driving cars and contact lenses are in the works to record memories from the wearer’s point of view. A system of social media-based ratings won’t just be limited to businesses on Yelp, but to each and every person in China. Augmented Reality is more than a tool for gaming manufacturers, it provides a training environment for our government. Robots will replace our appliances, our pets, and perhaps even us. With our jobs set to be taken over by machines, we might have to earn our keeps by participating in merit-based programs. And while we track our health with computers and governments track their enemies with drones, there’s no telling what data is tracked by secret applications and hidden hackers. It’s a scary nightmarish world out there and Black Mirror provides some uncomfortable answers while asking some more concerning questions.

In 1972, Nolan co-founded Atari, a multi-billion dollar company that changed the face of gaming forever. At the time, arcades were as popular as ever, but the market was quickly becoming saturated. Nolan wanted to break into a new demographic and had a dream of creating a gaming space dedicated entirely to kids. However, in the 1970s, families were still hesitant to introduce their children to the world of video games. Nolan knew that gaming needed a friendly face to change their hearts and minds, and thus was born Chuck E. Cheese.

ABOUT TOM CLANCY’S THE DIVISION 2:
Seven months have passed since a deadly virus hit New York City and the rest of the world, crippling the population. When the virus hit, The Division, a unit of civilian sleeper agents, was activated as the last line of defense. Since then, Division agents have been fighting relentlessly to save what remains.

For The Division, the stakes are higher than ever. Washington, D.C. – the most heavily protected city on earth – is at risk, leaving the entire nation on the brink of collapse. If Washington, D.C., is lost, then the nation falls. As a Division agent who has been in the field for seven months, you and your team are the last hope to stop the fall of society after the pandemic collapse.

Developed by Ubisoft Massive and the same teams that brought you Tom Clancy’s The Division®, Tom Clancy’s The Division® 2 is an online open world, action shooter RPG experience set in a collapsing and fractured Washington, D.C. This rich new setting combines a wide variety of beautiful, iconic, and realistic environments where the player will experience the series’ trademark for authenticity in world building, rich RPG systems, and fast-paced action like never before. Play solo or co-op with a team of up to four players to complete a wide range of activities, from the main campaign and adversarial PvP matches to the Dark Zone – where anything can happen.

A TRANSFORMED WASHINGTON, D.C.
In the wake of the virus, storms, flooding, and subsequent chaos have radically transformed Washington, D.C. Explore a living open world full of diverse environments, from flooded urban areas to historic sites and landmarks, during one of the hottest summers in history. The streets have been overrun with enemy factions, each with its own agenda and each vying for control of DC. It will be up to you to liberate the city and protect what remains of society.

BEST-IN-CLASS ENDGAME EXPERIENCE
Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 was built with an “endgame-first” mentality, ensuring players always have access to fresh, unique, and diverse activities long after completing the main campaign. Tom Clancy’s The Division 2’s endgame will introduce brand new challenges and progression systems, unique twists and surprises, and for the first time, raids. Players will also be able to access a wealth of post-launch content, including a full year of free additional story-driven missions, map expansions, and gameplay modes.

REVAMPED PLAYER PROGRESSION AND NEW SPECIALIZATIONS
After completing the main campaign, gain access to new specializations such as demolitionist, sharpshooter, and survivalist. Each specialization will open up an entire new progression system with new skills, mods, and unique talents to acquire and maximize your agent efficiency in your chosen role.

DYNAMIC LIVING WORLD
Civilians and enemy factions are constantly striving to survive, vying for necessities such as food, medicine, and ammunition. As the factions face off against each other in a ravaged DC, they will fight to seize control of resources and locations – and for their very survival. The various needs and motivations from each faction will collide, triggering different encounters between enemy and friendly factions, civilians, and ultimately you as an Agent, creating a dynamic living world full of surprises.

UNITE THE CIVILIANS
Civilians have banded together in settlements to rebuild their society, but their very existence is threatened. Work closely with them to keep them safe and in turn, they will come to your aid and provide supplies and assistance to build up your base of operations, giving a deeper meaning to the people and the world around you.

A RENEWED DARK ZONE EXPERIENCE
The Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map with some of the best loot in the game. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tension are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot. In Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, this playground was designed to provide a fair and exciting experience to all players, regardless of their level of progression.

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

This is how our government works now. If your party is in charge, you can lie, you can cheat, you can game the system to benefit your buddies, you can basically do whatever you want.

THE SATORI STORY
We are Nick and Kelly, two people with a spirit for adventure. Here we are documenting our journey as we travel the world with our dog Arthur aboard Satori (1989 Morgan 44 Center Cockpit Sailboat). This is a story of sailing and adventure, but its also about the beautiful souls we meet along the way. It’s a story of two people living their lives a little differently in order to gain a new perspective on our beautiful planet and the people in it. Our experiences have affected us in such a way, we are sharing them in the hopes that others will find the inspiration to do what they are passionate about.

The history of First Ladies in the White House is complex and has undergone quite the evolution to get to where it is now.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZkyjoeLNOyk/sddefault.jpg,0.011730946168117169,0.0001282070619466357,91.5,0.0006360075818137025,0.011859153230063802,0.012495160811877504,2018-03-22,08:35:00,Thursday,3,8,37,8,32,48,331,2,76,0,1,7,16,1,0,5.0,8.0,['TTT'],['TTT'],True,['ttt'],1,1,3,0,0,0,0,6.2973195066445395,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

The message of this video was to show how my grandmother, even though is a homophobe, put her differences and beliefs aside for me, her granddaughter, because she loves me. This video was absolutely not to make fun of her at all. I didn't record this for views, the day i posted this, my nana told me (and i posted this on snapchat) if i had a boyfriend, i said no, and she asked me why, i said i dont know, and she asked word by word ""you dont like girls right???"" and then that is when i decided to tell her im bisexual. I posted this for my friends to see, and i never intended it to go viral, but, She IS a homophobe, and i understand there are different levels of homophobia, and im blessed to still have my grandmother love me, it just breaks my heart how people dont see the message of this video. I absolutely did not make that discord server for clout, I made it so the viewers that are LGBT+ that feel unaccepted or need some people to talk to have somewhere to go.

When it comes to “doing it for the gram”, these celebs know exactly what they’re doing.

Last year Selena Gomez was the “most liked” celeb on Instagram, but this year that title goes to Beyonce. Bee’s twin pregnancy reveal photo back in February was not only the most-liked Insta pic of 2017, as of now it’s the most like Insta pic of all TIME! Considering Beyonce is our Queen, we fully support her winning the most-liked title thanks to 11.1 million fans liking the pic on Instagram.

Bee’s most liked 2017 pic beat out the previously reigning winner which was Selena Gomez’s Coca-Cola ad. That one had 6.8 million likes last year, which means Bee’s pregnancy reveal had almost twice the amount of likes this year. I dare anyone to try and beat that record next year. 

The second-most liked pic went to soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, who posted a sweet pic of his girlfriend right after she gave birth to his fourth child. That pic gained 11.02 likes, so clearly Instagram followers are very into liking posts about pregnancies and babies.

Third place went to SelGo and her kidney transplant announcement pic, which received 10.3 million likes.

As for the most followed celebs, Selena Gomez still reigns queen in that category with over 130 million followers, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with 116 million, and then  Ariana Grande with 115 million. SelGo’s top 25-liked posts are filled with tons of pics from sexy photoshoots, pics of her and The Weeknd, and her epic Wizards of Waverly place reunion. 

Other celebs that deserve honorable mentions are Twenty One Pilots, who had the most mentions of all the music artists in 2017, Colombian singer Maluma, who garnered the most Instagram Stories this year, and all the music artists who made the top ten for most liked music artists, including Selena, Ariana, Beyonce, Taylor, Justin, Nicki, Miley, J-Lo, Katy Perry, and Demi. Other artists out there--if you want in on the top ten, I suggest you post an epic pregnancy or birth announcement STAT.   

Alright guys now I wanna now what you think of these most followed and liked celebs on Instagram stats--are you surprised with the top celebs, or not at all? And who do you predict will surpass these celebs next year? Sound off with your thoughts in the comments and after at be sure to subscribe! Thanks so much for watching, I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr. and I’ll see you next time!

AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC.

The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.

Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zmj6sNmv-yQ/sddefault.jpg,0.0042341996691939035,0.002558470519890284,1.6549730146491903,0.0017437840706114192,0.006792670189084188,0.008536454259695608,2018-03-12,00:31:27,Monday,0,18,52,16,50,96,484,1,121,1,3,12,0,6,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.817762303750192,1,['angry'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Samurai Bow explores the violence, beauty and reverie which surround the Samurai's earliest weapon. With stunning dramatic reconstruction, we reveal the ancient way of the Samurai and explore how the bow could avert wars when put in the hands of a true master. 

Featuring Japan's most revered archery teacher Master Ogasawara we visit his mounted archery school and see the students intense training and dedication, then follow Ogasawara's son as he prepares to shoot from a galloping horse in the Yabusame ceremony.

Comparing the Japanese bow to another great war bow, the English Longbow we put them both through scientific tests to examine the specialities of each. Using stunning high speed footage we reveal their power and precision and ask what makes the Yumi so special.

Master craftsmen, martial artists and expert historians combine to tell the story of this noble weapon from its bloody past to its revered standing today in Samurai Bow.

Reptiles emerged from the Paleozoic as humble creatures, but in time, they grew to become some of the largest forms of life ever to stomp, swim, and soar across the planet. This Age of Reptiles was a spectacular prehistoric epic, and it all took place in a single era: the Mesozoic.

This episode (as well as most episodes of Eons) features beautiful paleoart from Studio 252mya. We dare you to try to not spend hours looking at their work: http://252mya.com

And thanks as always to Nobumichi Tamura for allowing us to use his wonderful paleoart: http://spinops.blogspot.com/

～ありそうでなかった、メイドによるガチのロック・バンド～
衣装はメイド服、ライブを『お給仕』、観客を『ご主人様』・『お嬢様』と呼び、メイドワールドを展開する一方で、その世界観とは相反するハードなロック・サウンドを武器に観る人を魅了し、Facebookに公開した「Thrill（スリル）」MVは、たった2週間で200万再生を記録。
既に日本だけに留まらず、海外のご主人様、お嬢様にも熱狂的に受け入れられており、2016年に、アメリカ・シアトルで初海外お給仕を実施後、世界8ヵ国9カ所で初ワールドツアーを開催し、合計7,000人以上を動員。
2017年は、各地でチケットがSOLD OUTが続出しているバンド初のワンマンツアーを全国6カ所（8公演）で開催。
また、SUMMER SONIC 2017、RISING SUN ROCK FESTIVAL 2017等の国内大型ロック・フェスに多数出演。
年末には二回目のワールドツアーを実施、
その集大成として、新木場スタジオコースト、Zepp Divercity Tokyoでのワンマンを成功させる。

She swung by Vevo to answer a few questions and dispense some advice about wearing makeup, balancing a performance career with real life, and taking online crushes into the real world.

Lyrics:
Baby what you wishing for
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains it pours (Keep on wishing)
I don't know how to wish anymore (Keep on wishing)
I don't know how to wish anymore, or do I 
(I don't know how to wish it)

Wish you'd get out my face
Might go MIAMight just blow my brains I’d be Kurt Cobain 
I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face

I wish you would find your chill
Cause lord knows this shit get real
If it is price, you know you killMan, this big rack you know the deal
Man this big slap you know the deal
Draco a big dragon, fire and hell
And send me man, say yourself
Cause I do not need no hell

Keep on wishing, keep on wishing, keep on wishing

(oooh aahhh)
(ooh) 

Baby what you wishing for 
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains it pours (Keep on wishing)
I don't know how to wish anymore (Keep on wishing)
I don't know how to wish anymore, or do I
(I don't know how to wish it)

Wish you’d get out my face
Might go MIAMight just blow my brain
I’d be Kurt Cobain 
I can't feel my face, I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face 

Baby what you wishing for 
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains it pours
I don't know how to wish anymore
I don't know how to wish anymore, or do I

(oooh aahhh)
(ooh)
