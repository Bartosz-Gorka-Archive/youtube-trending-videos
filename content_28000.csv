Giant Cannon is one of the strongest defense against Heroes in clash of clans. It can defeat heroes easily. Nothing gets in the way of the Giant Cannon. It's mammoth-sized cannon balls push past anything and just going and going and going.....:D

‚û§‚û§ It will be very interesting to see which troop is gonna survive..

These tiny sea creatures may have a not-so-tiny effect on the ocean. While it is believed that wind and tidal currents are the primary causes of the mixing of ocean waters ... Scientists at Stanford University discovered zooplankton can also have this effect.

Organisms like krill and brine shrimp swim hundreds of meters up to the surface in groups of billions. These enormous swarms could create powerful currents in the ocean. Previously, scientists believed that zooplankton could only affect the water in their own size range. But the krill in this tank show that, as a group, they can create powerful turbulence. Scientists hope to conduct these studies in the ocean, and the findings could shed light on how animals can influence our climate on land.

ABOUT AMERICAN IDOL
AMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, will return to airwaves on SUNDAY, MARCH 11 at 8|7c, at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2017, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy¬Æ Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.

So she decided to fan the flames by torching her ex-fianc√©‚Äôs closet in revenge. 

When talking with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Iggy admitted she lit all of Swaggy P's designer threads on fire. ""I burned a lot, and I threw stuff in the pool too. I started off with water and it just seemed like that didn't work,"" the 27-year-old said. 

Iggy explained that before ignition, she texted Young to give him a chance to save his clothes before they turned to ash. She then proceeded to burn his precious items using the fire pit in their backyard, going in order of least expensive to most expensive. ""I texted him a video and I‚Äôm like, 'Hey, I‚Äôm burning your shit. I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre at, probably with some girl, so I hope you get home quickly because I‚Äôm moving on,‚Äô"" she said.

Disney‚Äôs A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres March 9th!
From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Wrinkle in Time,‚Äù an epic adventure based on Madeleine L‚ÄôEngle‚Äôs timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl‚Äôs transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one‚Äôs individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one‚Äôs own light.

It‚Äôs Damon. It‚Äôs Jo. And It‚Äôs Damon and Jo. Ok so look, we got tired of all the boring, predictable lifestyle and travel content out there, so we took matters into our own hands and started filming our travels, and adventures around the globe, in 5+ languages.

In this episode of Twin Toys, Eli and Liam go on an epic adventure fortnite battle royale style.  It first starts off when Mommy informs the twins they forgot to clean their room and when running upstairs they become very curious about what is inside the llama pinata.  After Dad sends them upstairs to finish cleaning their room, he realizes its time for another life lesson about temptation.  Throughout the day they stumble upon certain treasure chests they can't resist but should they have opened it up in the first place?  After the final test from Dad, they realized they had enough and now the PBT squad is live and active, but little do they know Dad knew they would suit up to go after him.  But after the kids realize Dad was ready, they had to prepare a defense in order to stop him.  Good thing they grabbed Dad's speed drink he brought home from last week otherwise they wouldn't be able to build the most awesome ultimate fortnite box fort ever created.  Who will win in yet another PBT family Nerf showdown?

Mandella built his fanbase with outfits that incorporated increasingly rare goods from the likes of Supreme and Palace. After showcasing how he updates his school uniform with personalized flair, Mandella states, ‚ÄúEveryone was kinda dressing the same ‚Ä¶ it was more about dressing to fit in than dressing how you wanna dress.‚Äù After school, he dons yellow Golf le Fleur sneakers and a matching puffer vest, taking us back to his parents house.

He walks us through the development of his personal style in this episode, starting with one of his first Supreme pieces and leading to his impressive collection of sneakers. Mandella gives his mom and friends credit for taking his now iconic Instagram photos before describing the evolution of his own style, noting ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt knock anyone‚Äôs hustle ‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs what people need to start doing, I think that‚Äôs why people hate.‚Äù

I'm sure it comes as no surprise- but Jenn is an actual human being! With feelings! And negative ones too! Sometimes!

--------------------------------------------------

Following is a transcript of the video:

Alyssa Pagano: When I was born, the median price for a house was $108,900. Now, it's $337,200. Even if you account for inflation, that's about a 45% increase in cost. But buying a house is something I would like to do. So I'm trying to figure out if I can.

The odds are pretty stacked against me. I'm a millennial, and I graduated college in 2010, right in the middle of the recession. When I entered the workforce, the job market was rough. Like many of my peers, I have student loan debt. And on top of that, there aren't very many starter or mid-price homes on the market. My personal financial situation has to do with choices I made. I changed careers at 27, I took out loans to go back to grad school, and I didn't manage to save any money before that. But that's not abnormal for someone my age.

According to a LinkedIn study, it's common for millennials to change jobs about three times in the first five years after college. And in the eight years I've been out of college, I've lived in New York City the whole time. Median cost of a home here? $770,000. I certainly can't afford that. When I look at my income, cost of living and student loan debt, the idea of buying something as expensive as a house seems nearly impossible.

My dream home would look something like this. Or this. But even if my boyfriend and I took our combined income of $100,000 a year, that apartment is a pipe dream. I went to Business Insider's own financial planner, Lauren Lyons Cole. I figured if anyone could help me, it would be her.

Lauren Lyons Cole: When you're just starting out, you can calculate a general price range by taking your annual income and multiplying it by three. With a combined income of about $100,000 a year, that means a home that costs around $300,000 would be a good starting point.

Pagano: That's not as bad as I was expecting, but I have no idea what I can get for that price.

Cole: With a budget like that in New York City, you probably aren't gonna find that many options. So you might have to make sacrifices, which could even mean relocating to another city. But then you have to figure out what kind of job options are there, and how much could you get paid to do the work you want to do. You have to think about which amenities you really want and which ones you can do without.

Pagano: I've always wanted some kind of outdoor space, like maybe a balcony. A two-bedroom would be nice... big windows... maybe a turret. What? I'm a millennial. I'm idealistic.

Cole:¬† Once you have an idea of what you can afford and what you're willing to give up, you can take the next step and start looking at listings that are available in your price range.

Pagano: With the budget Lauren and I came up with, I browsed options in a few cities I could see myself living in. I wasn't amazed with anything I came across, but there were some that were nice. Not so much in New York, especially when I compare it to the apartment I live in now, which is below market rent.

I also checked out Grand Rapids, Michigan because it was number one on Business Insider's list of best housing markets for millennials. There, I did find some amazing places within my budget, but I can't see myself picking up and moving there right now. For me, owning a place isn't worth living somewhere where I don't know anyone and I don't have a job lined up. So I think for now I'm gonna keep renting and try to save up for a down payment. Maybe in a few years the price of avocado toast will go down, and I'll be able to afford that dream castle.

Maybe a balcony... a two-bedroom would be nice... big windows... maybe a turret.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zzx-QEgv-gw/sddefault.jpg,0.011193271430078396,0.0035891538087482727,3.118637992831541,0.004784251976607465,0.014782425238826669,0.01956667721543413,2018-05-05,15:00:03,Saturday,5,9,29,9,28,45,258,1,46,0,0,8,4,5,2,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.666252305479103,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Jadranko Prliƒá stoga je finalno osuƒëen na 25 godina zatvora, Bruno Stojiƒá na 20. Dok se izricala presuda Slobodanu Praljku, on je ustao, viknuo: ‚ÄúSlobodan Praljak nije zloƒçinac! S prijezirom odbacujem va≈°u presudu!‚Äù.

Trenutak je izgledao iznimno dramatiƒçno, no sudac se na prvu nije obazirao na Praljkovu reakciju, samo mu je rekao da sjedne. Meƒëutim, Praljkova odvjetnica zatra≈æila je prekid i kazala kako je njezin klijent popio otrov. ƒåitanje presude je prekinuto u tom trenutku i spustio se zastor.

Transcript:

In 2045 the world is a dump-fossil fuels are all but burned up, precipitating a Global Energy Crisis, a food shortage AND a housing crisis. To top it all off, a few major corporations control most things. It's your standard issue wasteland, but with a twist! 

This dystopia comes with a U-topia in the form of the OASIS, a massively multiplayer online simulation game that absolutely everyone uses to make life livable. This powerful piece of saving grace comes courtesy of Gregarious Simulation Systems, founded by benevolent eccentric geniuses, James Halliday and Ogdon Morrow, who for years have staved off the unwanted advances of IOI, a global communications conglomerate and the planet's biggest Internet service provider. Halliday and Morrow, once the bromance of a lifetime, parted ways under mysterious circumstances. Morrow sold his stock in the company to Halliday, who became reclusive, then ill, finally passing away and leaving behind the greatest Easter Egg hunt the world has ever seen. 

The prize? Halliday's enormous fortune and ownership of the OASIS. Oh, yeeeaaah.

All the egg hunters, or ""gunters"", need is the OASIS and an exhaustive knowledge of Halliday's favorite decade. Enter Wade Watts, an 80's obsessed trailer park resident and ardent egg hunter. But right behind Wade are IOI's gunters bent on total world wide web domination‚Ä¶ and they'll do anything for Halliday's estate.

Have fun!

Listen out for the voice to say
Just keep moving, oh

Go, go, go

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh, my love, don't stop burning
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames

[Verse 2: Sia]
Don't stop, tomorrow's another day
Don't stop, tomorrow you'll feel no pain

Love them or hate them, you have to admit that rich kids around the world lead pretty exciting lives. From vacationing around on private jets to living like theyre rockstars, we can understand why you might be jealous of them. They‚Äôre also able to fully pursue what theyre passionate about in life without having to worry about money. If youve ever wondered what life might be like for the wealthy kids of Thailand, check out our video to go Inside The Lives Of The Rich Kids Of Thailand. 

Boss Yoovidhya was called out for being one of Bangkoks deadly rich kids after his reckless driving ended the life of a police officer. This heir to the Red Bull fortune didnt even stop to check if the cop was okay after he accidentally dragged him along the road. Youd think that hed be in jail right now, but his prosecution keeps getting delayed because he never shows up to court. But youll have to keep watching to hear what his big excuse is.

If you want to know where Beyonc√© and Jay Z vacation when they visit Thailand, look no further than the Kata Rocks resort in Phuket. This place is so luxurious that its known for being Phukets playground for rich kids. When the rich kids of Thailand are looking for a little staycation, this five-star resort is where they choose to go. Where else can they find such a perfect background for all of their Instagram needs?

Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, issued a statement saying he planned to retire from Congress at the end of this term and would return to working in the justice system.

Gowdy's announcement makes him the latest Republican committee chairman to announce retirement ahead of midterm elections that are seeing a spike in Republicans headed for the exit.

Youtube has so many different types of creators. You have the hair & beauty gurus, the comedians,  crazy challenges, (fake) pranks, DIY and so much more. So I created a sketch comedy/parody based around all the different youtubers. Let me know which type of Youtuber I missed and don't forget to share the video and tell a friend about my channel.

Wendy congratulated Snoop Dogg for his #1 gospel record, while dissing the Clark sisters. She said it is time for the Clark Sisters to ""step up their game"", implying that they have done nothing in their career (The Clark Sisters won Grammys, sold millions of records, and had the number one gospel album multiple times).  Kirk Franklin, Tasha Cobbs, and Kierra Sheard spoke out in defense of the beloved group...which forced Wendy Williams to backtrack on her statements. Wendy released a statement on Instagram and invited the group to perform on her show.

I did something crazy! Some might consider what I did destroying a valuable award, but in today's video, after unboxing it, I actually went ahead and turned my brand new Youtube Gold Play Button (which we received for hitting 1 million subscribers this year) into an ant farm. I moved in one of our five ant colonies cased on popular vote from a poll on our new Youtube Community Tab. It was truly an exciting, creative, and epic venture, but you will love how the ants react to living inside the new custom-designed Gold Play Button.

We also explain how your support means so much to us and how it has helped support ant research and ant keeping product development. You guys are all ambassadors of ant love. Thank you to the AC Family, our subscribers who tune in every week! It's ant love forever!

SPOILER-FILLED discussion of THE LAST JEDI's most contentious plot points. Yes, another live-footage episode in order to get it out and up in time for you at the length it deserves; this time with the teleprompter akwardly reflected in my shades rather than awkwardly stumbling over my words by working without a script. Aiming for a ""traditional"" episode next week, hope you enjoy this one for now :)

2) Netflix in Talks to Grab Cloverfield Movie ‚ÄòGod Particle‚Äô From Paramount

3) Opening This Week 

4) Warner Bros. Planning Animated Dr. Seuss Film Series, Starting with ‚ÄòCat in the Hat‚Äô

5) ‚ÄòThe Cured‚Äô Trailer Finds Ellen Page in a Zombie Outbreak

6) Mail Bag

7)  Live Twitter Questions

More updates coming in for Fox‚Äôs upcoming New Mutants movie directed by Josh Boone. The film was recently pushed from its previous release date of April 13th to almost a year later for February 22, 2019. Now, for fans hoping that the movie with a horror-story angle would be R-rated like Deadpool and Logan, Boone confirmed to Empire Magazine that that won‚Äôt be the case, and the movie will be receiving a PG-13 rating.  

The Cloververse might be getting a bit more tangled in the near future. First reported by The Tracking Board‚Äôs Jeff Sneider and now confirmed by THR, Netflix is in talks with Paramount to acquire the next movie in the Cloverfield Universe, previously known as God Particle and rumored of late to be entitled Cloverfield Station. 

OPENING THIS WEEK

AGREE / DISAGREE 

According to THR, the Warner Bros. animation division is teaming with Dr. Seuss Enterprises to produce a series of feature films based on the characters and stories from the Dr. Seuss catalogue, starting with The Cat in the Hat. The film is now in development and will begin searching for a writer soon. 

The first trailer has been released for the new zombie horror entitled The Cured starring Ellen Page. Set in a world ravaged for years by a zombie-like virus that turns the infected into cannibals, a cure is found at last allowing the survivors to reintegrate back into society. The movie arrives in theatres on February 23, 2018.

To me the question isn't whether we reform, it's how. And I would like to talk some about that. I think there's an easy argument to make that much of the problem with YouTube isn't YouTube's problem, it's a cultural problem, and this article in The Verge (that I agree with only partially) talks about that the best I've seen so far: https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850798/logan-paul-youtube-social-media-twitch-moderation

There isn't a way, at least right now, to create a YouTube alternative that would work for creators. Many people have tried...some are trying right now...but I don't think it's possible. So we have to do our best to make this platform and this community the best thing we can. And that's hard and long and it might feel foolish since, ultimately, it's not a democracy, it's a corporation, but it's where we are. And I think there is space to make it better, but we won't be able to do that unless there are good ideas that are getting pushed and implemented. So, let's go there. Please please share your ideas.

Avicii predicts his sudden death in a documentary released a few months before his passing.

A haunting quote reveals he feared he would die young.

New details have emerged since Swedish DJ Avicii‚Äôs death on Friday April 20th at the age of 28. In a recent documentary called Avicii: True Stories he admits to being worried about his heath. Avicii had repeatedly warned his management that his hectic touring schedule would kill him. The documentary released in October 2017 was made available on Netflix, but appears to have been pulled following his passing. In it Avicii, whose real name is Tim Bergling, confessed to cameras that he is QUOTE, ‚Äúgoing to die‚Äù if he does not stop performing.

Avicii‚Äôs friend and documentary filmmaker filmed him for four years, capturing his rise to fame and his decision to retire from performing in March 2016. But he wasn‚Äôt prepared for what happened following that decision. Avicii revealed QUOTE, ‚ÄúI have been very open with everyone I work with, and everyone who knows me. Everyone knows that I‚Äôve had anxiety and that I have tried. I did not expect that people would try to pressure me into doing more gigs.‚Äù He says he expected support, instead of push-back from his team.

https://youtu.be/1ZFK3VKzQIs

Avicii had been open about his shy personality and the anxiety that came with performing in front of massive audiences. The documentary reveals he used alcohol to deal with the pressure of the spotlight and by 21 was diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening acute pancreatitis. As a result, he was hospitalized in 2014 and forced to have his appendix and gallbladder removed.

Avicii performed eight-hundred and thirteen shows between 2008 and 2016. In a haunting QUOTE Avicii predicted his fate, ‚ÄúI have told them this: I won‚Äôt be able to play anymore. I have said, like, I‚Äôm going to die. I have said it so many times.‚Äù No official cause of death has been announced yet, but honestly it‚Äôs hard to ignore these signs that his team should have seen coming. We here at Clevver continue to send our heartfelt condolences to his close friends and family at this time. Now we wanna hear from you guys- tell us below your reaction to these shocking updates. And click here to see celebs react to Avicii‚Äôs sudden passing. Thanks for tuning in to Clevver, I‚Äôm Drew Dorsey.

Lyrics:

I'm not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one will love you as you are

But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become

Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
Gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

...This is me

And I know that I deserve your love
There's nothing I'm not worthy of
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

I'm gonna send a flood
Gonna drown them out

this video is about our little golden maknae being himself.
In this video you‚Äôll see him speaking in English and making his hyungs laugh, as well as playing with the little puppy Miri.
He will try to prove you that he can cook very well, but the most of the time you‚Äôll see him eating instead of cooking.
While they eat Kimchi and try to cook, V pays attention to something else. He likes Jungkooks silky hair so much and can hold his hands off Jungkooks hair.
I hope you‚Äôll enjoy the video!

Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 leaves Litwak's video arcade behind, venturing into the uncharted, expansive and thrilling world of the internet which may or may not survive Ralph's wrecking. Video game bad Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope's video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet - the netizens - to help navigate their way, including a website entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making website - Buzztube.

******************* ABOUT THE VIDEO ***********************

We wanted to do a video with Walabot to show how it worked and do something fun.  They agreed and this is what we came up with.  We did a fun little game of hide and seek and really raised the stakes, Mitchell's phone, wallet and keys to the Humvee were hidden under a board, then using the Walabot we found the items, then cut through the maze.  Luckily there weren't any casualties.  Then we answered one of the most asked questions...""what would happen if i touched the waterjet?"" and ""You should put your **** in the waterjet""   A sausage is a lick-test equivalent of a finger.  

Support us on patreon and we'll have fun exclusive videos and live streams and awesome giveaways and discounts.

Give up these noises 
Silence my mind 
We all have choices
Where can I find

My happy place

Fuck me up

Shut up around me
Voices about 
Swear I'm not crazy 
What's the amount for 

My happy place 

fuck me up
ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL

Now that he's added striking to his game, all while cultivating his unteachable resilience, Ortega may be the most exciting prospect in the UFC's stacked featherweight division. Recount his undefeated rise through the UFC as told by Ortega, his trainers, UFC analysts and his opponents.

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, ‚ÄúTed,‚Äù ‚ÄúCosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey‚Äù), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship‚Äôs Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (‚ÄúMarvel‚Äôs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,‚Äù ‚ÄúFriday Night Lights‚Äù) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who‚Äôs assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (‚Äú24,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Larry Sanders Show‚Äù), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (‚ÄúER,‚Äù ‚ÄúJustified‚Äù), Peter Macon as Bortus (‚ÄúShameless,‚Äù ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (‚ÄúNeighbors,‚Äù ‚ÄúGoosebumps‚Äù), J.

Notes:
At 0:47, I refer to the console Kosmic is using as the Nintendo Famicom Disk System. He wasn't actually playing on the Disk System, just the Famicom. The Famicom is essentially the Japanese equivalent of the NES, and the Disk System is an add-on to it that reads special floppy disks.

At 4:06, I mention that Kosmic holds the Glitchless WR with a 5:06.709. However, there is a video by Scott Kesler of a 5:05. This is because of timing differences. Glitchless is how Twin Galaxies (a deprecated high score website) view Super Mario Bros. speedruns, and its timing rules are different. They time from the start press on the title screen, which, because of framerules, adds a variation of up to 21 frames to the time of the run based on which frame you pressed start on. This timing difference adds about 2.5 seconds, so Scott Kesler's 5:05 was actually a high 5:07 by TG rules, and Kosmic's 5:06.709 is a low 5:04 with regular timing.

At 13:15, I say that when the white pixel is missing, the judges are in a bad mood. For the sake of simplicity, I omitted that it's actually a 50/50 of good/bad judges if you don't get the pixel. However, this is frame dependent and not entirely random, and Kosmic rarely gets good judges with the bad pixel, so I took that shortcut.

At 26:35, I claim that the theoretical human limit is 4:55.496. The actual time is 4:55.49668, and it should have been rounded up to 4:55.497.

There is another framerule that was not included because while it is considered too hard for humans to ever get in a run. You can save it by doing a frame perfect fast acceleration at the start of 8-1 (after several seconds of black screen, with inhuman reaction time) to save 2 frames, and then doing a TAS flagpole glitch to save 19 frames instead of 15. TAS flagpole glitch never slows down to set it up and is based around doing a left-right wiggle at some point during the level and praying that it set your position up perfectly. The best consistency at this trick is just about 1%, compared to 40% for regular FPG. On March 4th (2 days after the release of this video), StuckInAPlate managed to save the 8-1 framerule from a savestate immediately before gaining control, which eliminates the need to time your frame perfect inputs after a very long wait. https://youtu.be/J1-xDJrmzFY

I figured some of you would appreciate knowing who the mystery woman that was seen with Mike Perry is. She‚Äôs finally surfaced thanks to Perry tagging her on Instagram. She seems to be part of the air force as she has USAF on her page and also has pictures in air force fatigues. Let‚Äôs hope Mike stays focused on improving as a fighter and not get too distracted.

Tyron Woodley has confirmed that he indeed is on the verge of training Floyd Mayweather in MMA and explained that the possibility of him crossing over is more likely than people believe it to be. He said Floyd‚Äôs main problem would be defending vs takedowns and kicks and it‚Äôs what they‚Äôre currently planning to work on. From the moment his training begins he could be ready in as little as 3 months. for the full interview check out the link to TMZ in my description box below. 
‚ÄúYou all think it‚Äôs a joke but think about this. Floyd Mayweather is one of the best strikers of all time. How many guys in the UFC that can‚Äôt wrestle, that can‚Äôt grapple and they consider themselves a stand-up fighter, if they have to stand across from one of the greatest strikers ever, they gonna be in a world of smoke. First thing we‚Äôll work on is kicks, blocking the kicks. There is no point in him learning how to kick, defending kicks. Secondly, obviously defending takedowns. If he is able to evade punches at a fraction of a second and make people looks stupid and miss a million times, then he can learn wrestling defense because he‚Äôs learned that through drilling technique, repetition. So, doing those things and then obviously he‚Äôll decide what fight he wants to take and at that point we‚Äôll game plan of that. You know, connor‚Äôs not that great of a wrestler. He‚Äôs not like a world class jiu jitsu guy so if he can‚Äôt land one of those kicks on Floyd and he can‚Äôt take him down. If you‚Äôre an athlete and can pay attention and learn quick you can stop a takedown especially when you have the octagon to help you, the octagon when you press up against it that‚Äôs like two people fighting a takedown. I think he has a chance for sure, but I think, for the kicks he might need 2 or 3 weeks. For some of the wrestling defensive things, it‚Äôs going to be very similar to boxing because boxing uses a lot of angles a lot of hip motion, great footwork, so it‚Äôs the same thing to stop the shot before it gets there through footwork. So I would say in totatl, all in all, maybe 2 and half months

Eight states, and the District of Columbia, have so far legalised the drug for recreational use, starting with Colorado and Washington in 2012. 

Sessions, though, said the previous policy ‚Äúundermines the rule of law.‚Äù In his statement Sessions said he was giving federal prosecutors more discretion about enforcing federal law, even in states where marijuana use is legal.
 
Supporters of the move say Sessions is protecting public health and safety, and will stem the burgeoning and lucrative industry‚Äôs growing support from financial institutions and investors. But critics say the move could cause chaos and confusion and have adverse effects on people of colour.
 
According to an October 2017 Gallup Poll, 64% of approve of legalising marijuana for recreational use - the highest level of support the polling firm has found since it began asking the question in 1969.
 
But what effect will this legislative change have? We discuss on The Stream at 1930GMT.

Toddlers and Tiaras was a guilty pleasure show for many of us. Sure, covering little kids in spray tans and parading them around in expensive dresses is pretty strange, but at the end of the day it was just fun to watch. Many of us have wondered: ‚Äúwhere are they now?‚Äù Well, you won‚Äôt have to wonder anymore, because we caught up with some of your favorite stars, and we‚Äôll let you know what they‚Äôre doing today. Lacey-Mae Mason made headlines for being the first contestant on the show with dwarfism, and she‚Äôs still competing to this day. In addition to starting an incredible anti-bullying foundation of course. Then there‚Äôs Isabella Barrett, who became a millionaire at the age of six and now owns two companies. Eden Wood is still modeling, and recently strolled the catwalk at a big fashion show. The Tiara Twins are still going strong, and it seems like their mother is as obsessed with their success as ever.

I did not get into details about the show in my last video, i was too dumbfounded and i focused mainly on the CGI portion.
So instead of just complaining about it, i've tried to come up with a potential solution.

Do we even know or want a modern equivalent of reboot?
is it possible? We are way too tech savvy nowadays, we can't be appeased.

I was inspired by Nando v movies to come up with a theoretical solution to the steaming pile of a dumpster fire that the trailer was.
It is arguably the most disliked trailer ever made and a huge disservice to its fanbase, i can only imagine that the company will go bankrupt because of this decision. It will do, what DRIV3R did to ATARI. Destroy the company.


Maybe the rage will give enough momentum for a kick starter to fund the project the original creators wanted?

I offer alternate directions for the show to go. Just from the top of my head, borrowing influences from other shows we love.

Blake investigates whether being clipped in improves the ride of a hardtail. Blake is mostly a fan of flats for hardtail riding but is giving clips a go since being introduced by Doddy. Blake doesn't seem the biggest fan for jumps but likes the efficient feeling for climbing.

Let us know if you like clips or flats for hardtail riding üëá

DISCLAIMER

Occasionally I am lucky enough to be sent products/clothing free of charge by PR companies, meaning, I may not have paid for everything I talk about. I am not in ANY way obligated to mention these products and if I have done so, it is because I genuinely like them. I would NEVER talk about or show something I didn't genuinely love.

Sometimes, I may be sponsored by brands for videos. I turn down 90% of sponsorship opportunities. I will not accept unless I love the brand/product already. All products/items will still have been chosen by myself, and the video concept will always be my own idea. I would never endorse a brand/product that I didn't truly love and believe in.

I use affiliate links in the description box of this channel. This means I earn a very small percentage when you purchase a product I recommend- the same way a sales associate in a store earns commission when they help you select a product. This does not in any way affect the price you pay for the item, and absolutley does not influence my choice of items to show you. 

Lots of love,

There's nothing actually wrong with the testers other than the modest current used to power the test indicators that can cause a strong sensation when a ground path is open circuit and someone bridges it during the test.  (mild shock risk)
The recall is more an indication of the increasingly litigious nature of society and the current trend of deskilling the electrical industry with useless 1-week certification courses motivated entirely by profit.
If you have one of these testers you can return it to Fluke in exchange for a set of awesome test-lamps or the somewhat less desirable option of a padded bag and cheap non-contact live wire detector, which despite the quoted value is actually a much lesser prize.  As you can probably guess, I strongly recommend Fluke's awesome test-lamps as being 100% suitable for industrial use and totally worthy of addition to your tool kit.

‚ÄòStage‚Äô features hits from right across the band‚Äôs career and includes fan-favourite classics like ‚ÄòRiver Of Pain and ‚ÄòLove Walked In‚Äô - and of course ‚ÄòBackstreet Symphony‚Äô - bringing things right up to date with tracks from the 2017 Top 3 UK Chart Album title track Rip It Up‚Äô and ‚ÄòShe Likes The Cocaine‚Äô.  ‚ÄòStage‚Äô was captured at Cardiff Motorpoint Arena on March 24th 2017 during the UK Tour. Thunder toured Europe in April, followed by summer festivals, more shows in Germany with Alice Cooper in November, then returned to the UK to close the weekend at Planet Rock‚Äôs ‚ÄòRockstock‚Äô. They sold out 2 Christmas shows at Wolverhampton Civic Hall in December, followed by shows in Japan, Germany, Austria and Holland in January. The band are performing on the main stage at Download this year, on Saturday 9 June which Guns 'n' Roses headline. This is a band that knows how to rock a crowd and shows no signs of letting up!

Frontman Danny Bowes says of ‚ÄòStage‚Äô, ‚ÄúThe Rip It Up album was so well received, it was no surprise the tour was brilliant too.  We decided to include a Cardiff Motorpoint Arena show on the tour, purely because it was so good when we played there with Journey & Whitesnake in 2013. Capturing it as well turned out to be one of our better decisions, because the resulting film and album are a shining example of an organic ‚Äòcoming together‚Äô of fans and a band. We‚Äôve released a few live recordings over the years, but this is most definitely up there with the best of them. We're extremely pleased with it.‚Äù

‚ÄòStage‚Äô will be available as a 2CD + Blu-ray, 3LP, DVD, Blu-ray and a Limited Edition Box Set.  The audio-visual formats will feature a host of bonus and interview material, whilst the Limited Edition Box Set will include also boast the full ‚ÄòLive At The 100 Club‚Äô set, the ‚Äò29 Minutes Later‚Äô acoustic set [only previously made available as a Record Store Day release], and the documentary film ‚ÄòA Difficult Day In January: Thunder In London‚Äô.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_KYRL3VWS3Y/sddefault.jpg,0.010673571857138346,0.0003789433795433732,28.16666666666667,0.0005684150693150597,0.01105251523668172,0.01162093030599678,2018-02-16,10:30:01,Friday,4,13,19,13,19,81,133,8,31,3,0,8,0,2,2,5.0,6.0,"['~ BACKSTREET', 'TTL']","['~', 'BACKSTREET', 'TTL']",True,"['~', 'backstreet', 'ttl']",3,3,14,1,0,0,0,6.598056483955821,2,"['sad', 'happy']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

It's been a very intense time for the Colombian central defender but in spite of everything, his first impressions were that he was ‚Äúvery happy and grateful, motivated and proud.""

""Never before had I been in Barcelona and, for now, I'm in love with everything I see. I am calm, but I know that I have a great responsibility, because Bar√ßa is the best club in the world. I want to contribute and learn from my colleagues. I am fulfilling a dream,"" he explained in a somewhat peculiar interview on the day of his presentation.

Mina‚Äôs personal side
In the interview, Mina also spoke about the person away from the football pitch, so we can get to know him more thoroughly. He‚Äôs known as ""a happy but calm person"" who likes to share his life with the people he loves. Hear about his hobbies, the music he likes to hear, his superstitions, his favourite food and his idols, among other things.

Almost every analyst downgraded the stock today on the news.

In the Dow, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Apple (NASDAQ: APPL) were some of the names that made headlines as news that Apple may start to look at Intel for chips in their iPhones came out early on. Up until this point Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been the major supplier but that relationship has been rocky at best. Intel was lower on the day by 3.5%, Apple lost 2.5%, and Qualcomm sold off 6.57% on the news.

In the S&P 500, Mattel (NYSE: MAT) was once again one of the leaders as investors continue to support the earnings results and company plans going forward. The company has suffered from the trend of more digital entertainment from the younger population but their efforts to move into that space have started to attract investors to the name. Earnings did disappoint thanks to weak sales in their Fischer Price and American Girl brands.

A biologist who's spent nearly three decades studying humpback whale, Nan Hauser never experienced¬†an encounter like the one in September 2017. For ten minutes, the barnacle-knobbed humpback¬†nudged her, lifted her out of the water, and swept her under its pectoral fin. She thought the whale might kill her.¬†But once she was aboard her boat, she¬†saw¬†a tiger shark in the vicinity. Hauser thinks¬†the whale was trying to protect her. The claim was met with¬†skepticism by Hauser‚Äôs peers, and she understands their hesitation. But humpback whales do rescue animals‚Äîboth other humpbacks and other species‚Äîfrom predators. The reasons¬†for this behavior¬†aren‚Äôt fully known. Her first-person footage puts you right where¬†Hauser was. But it's nearly impossible to know the¬†humpback's¬†real motivation.

In this video I review the Lady Dior Classic/Timeless handbag and I recap on the 4 sizes that this bag is available in (Mini, Small (My Lady Dior), Medium & Large). I talk about wear and tear, as well as whether the bag is worth it from a return on investment point of view. I then move onto my newest Lady Dior, the Lady Dior ‚ÄòSupple‚Äô in patent black leather with aged gold studs and wide strap. This version takes the classic Lady Dior and makes a conservative and ladylike bag very edgy. I also discuss the openings of both bags (flap vs zip). Ultimately, I hope that if you‚Äôre watching this because you are wanting input on your thoughts to purchase, I hope this helps!

The Andromeda galaxy is heading straight toward our own Milky Way. The two galaxies will inevitably collide. Will that be the very last night sky our solar system witnesses?

Previous Episode:
Scientists Have Detected the First Stars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R9F2_D76TE

See that fuzzy blob on the sky? The one just left of the Milky Way center in the constellation of Andromeda. That‚Äôs M31 ‚Äì the Andromeda galaxy. It‚Äôs two and a half million light years away and host to a trillion stars. It has a beautiful spiral structure spanning its gently rotating disk 220 thousand light years in diameter, and a central bulge that hides a giant black hole that contains the mass of well over a hundred million Suns. Andromeda is also racing towards our galaxy at 110 km/s.

Republican Roy Moore is casting himself as a victim in Alabama's U.S. Senate race.

The group has run ads hammering Moore over alleged sexual misconduct involving teen girls.

I don't pull my punches and you can't buy 'the best bikes in the world' edit for an unworthy bike. Thanks to Endura, 7mesh, Gore, Giro and Camelbak for the test kit worn while filming.

In this video:

McDonald‚Äôs first started the Monopoly promotion in 1987, and its premise was simple: attach Monopoly pieces to food cartons and cups, with each piece signifying a Monopoly property or a small prize. One out of every four pieces would be a small prize, such as a medium fry or soda, and a very few of the prizes would be significantly more valuable, such as a car or, with the proper pieces, cash ‚Äì up to $1 million.

Are you a superhuman or worse than average? Check it out!

The older we get, the harder it becomes for us to hear high-frequency sounds. The worse it gets, the fewer chances you have of hearing the birds sing, the beeping of your microwave, and even consonants like s,h or f. You don‚Äôt want that to happen to you, right? Do you have any reasons to worry about it? How can you test your ears?
Here's a simple, but 100 % accurate test you can take, and we are going to run it in a few moments. When it‚Äôs done, we are going to share some fun facts on hearing we bet you didn‚Äôt know.
What should you do? Put on your headphones. Make sure you are in a quiet place, with no background noises.

SUMMARY
How many of you turned out to be superhumans who could catch the sound at 150? Anyone? Oh, yours was 120? That‚Äôs pretty amazing, too. 110? That is also better than the average result. Well done! Now, let us see how many of us hear have average or better than average hearing.
If your results are not so good, do not panic. Your age influences your ability to hear high frequencies, remember? If it‚Äôs really bad, try it again. Maybe the sound was off on your computer. If you are perfectly sure it‚Äôs not the computer to blame, you might want to see a doctor to figure out what‚Äôs wrong.

_TaLahrHK6c,H5tK00zL6EQ,I Wrote a Book. I WROTE A BOOK. How did I do that?,vlogbrothers,22.0,2018-01-26 20:38:15+00:00,"['hank green', 'vlogbrothers', 'books', 'writing', 'authors', 'education', 'book store', 'amazon', 'novel', 'novelist']",262746.0,15684.0,103.0,1704.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_TaLahrHK6c/default.jpg,"Preorder? http://www.hankgreen.com

This video is not actually about how to write a book, if anything it's about how to find the motivation, which I think (for me at least) was a lot more important. I think I realized that, often, I wasn't writing a thing because it wasn't that important to me, I wasn't that excited about it, and ultimately I was more into the idea of having people read a book I wrote than I was into the idea of writing a book.

I'm not saying you don't need that first thing, but t helps to have the second one too.

I also 100% recognize that this is all much easier if you don't have to worry the whole time about whether a publisher or agent will at least read your book and whether you have friends who are published authors who will help you revise and and vouch for you (thank you Patrick Rothfuss for that, btw.)

So, yeah, things are easier to do if you see the path, and understand where you might fit in.

#AQuietPlace

In John Krasinski's new movie A Quiet Place, those who have survived only know one rule: never make a sound. In this special episode of Things You Missed, I'll be taking cover from the creatures who prey on sound as I try to fill you in on all of the Things You Missed in A Quiet Place (2018).

I'll also be talking about the science of sound and how the characters took measures to protect themselves from the monsters in ways you might not have even realized. Then, on top of that I'll be going over Things You Missed that answer some of the biggest questions in the movie, such as:

‚ùì How come the Abbott family was able to beat them?
‚ùì What was the weakness of the creatures?
‚ùì Why do they kill?
‚ùì Where do they come from?

And as usual, I'll be analysing the film and offering all the Things You Missed pertaining to symbolism, clues to the meaning of the film and more! In this video, you'll see the creature origin revealed and I'll talk about a theory including the possibility of aliens! Enjoy these 32 Things You Missed In A Quiet Place. Silence. Is. Survival.

About A Quiet Place
Do not go quietly. Be the first to see A Quiet Place, starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, in theatres now. Those who have survived live by one rule: never make a sound.

This is the heartwarming a homeless boy, who‚Äôs ‚Äòonly ever wanted‚Äô a bed of his own, is surprised by a charitable organisation with a fully furnished bedroom, causing him to breakdown in tears. 

For the eight short years of his life, Daeyrs and his mum, Dionna, from Detroit, Michigan, have spent most of the youngster's childhood flitting from homeless shelter to homeless shelter, after Dionna lost her job and, subsequently, her home. 

After several years of on and off homelessness, the trainee nurse and her young son were finally supplied with state housing - but were unable to furnish their new home with anything more than two camp chairs and a blow-up mattress.

This left resilient Daeyrs to sleep on a nest of blankets on the floor.

This is what she said.
_______
Here are the questions Phil asks Alex:
1. How would you explain the difficulty that infertility has been in your life?
2. What would you say was the hardest part of infertility?
3. Would you say there is a difference between your maturity then and your maturity now?
4. If someone were to say now, ‚ÄúAlex be grateful for your two kids and move on‚Äù how would you respond?
5. Would you say your desire to have and want more kids is a selfish desire?
6. Take me on this journey from infertility, to Kinsley‚Äôs adoption, to Callie‚Äôs adoption, and how did we get to IVF now?
7. Do you feel stressed that IVF is tomorrow?
8. How did you get to the place to get so public with this private conversation on infertility?
9. Were you surprised that people said, ‚ÄúAlex I look up to you‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlex, you are a role model‚Äù? How do you react when you hear those compliments?
10. What is your hope for tomorrow going into IVF?
11. What would be the advice you would give to someone going through the pit of infertility right now?

Jonas's Top 10 plays as ranked by the CTWC organizers. This is an incredible display of Tetris‚Äî all within just one day.

In the 1990 Nintendo World Championship competition, Tetris was the game to beat. The winner, Thor Aackerlund, is still seen by many as the best to have ever played. Today‚Äôs Classic Tetris tournaments are played on that same version of Nintendo Tetris, using original NES game systems, controllers, and Tetris cartridges. In 2009, a player named Harry Hong became the first to achieve the highest possible score of 999,999 points. Inspired by this achievement, filmmaker Adam Cornelius produced a short film about Harry called ‚ÄúMax-Out‚Äù, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to document the world of competitive Tetris. As word of Adam‚Äôs Kickstarter campaign spread, rumors of max-out scores from other Tetris Masters began to surface, threatening the supremacy of Harry‚Äôs achievement. With the help of Nintendo World Championship veteran Robin Mihara, Adam searched for all of the Tetris Masters he could find. Jonas Neubauer emerged as an early max-out artist, along with the elusive original champ Thor Aackerlund. The idea of bringing these and other NES Tetris Masters together to compete in a live tournament became an obvious and irresistible proposition which was artfully captured in the 2010 feature length documentary Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters. Under the leadership of producer Vince Clemente, The Classic Tetris World Championship is currently held at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, an annual event which has hosted the tournament since 2012. Chuck Van Pelt and his organizing committee have built the PRGE into the largest classic gaming expo in the country, drawing around 6,000 attendees. Every year the scores get higher. Rivalries are revisited once again, and new players emerge to challenge the old guard. Over 20 players have maxed out the score now. Will you be the next?

The fractured worlds that inhabit this space were once locked in a force of uncontrollable destruction. Gravity was lost. Their planetary trajectories conjoined in one catastrophic collision, choking to remain viable even as the dying glow of their cores peek through the cracks and scars of those impactful moments. Yet a gasp is a sign of life and the planets that many might have cast off as annihilated space continued to show a pulse across the hopelessness. This discarded earth is still very much alive‚Ä¶and made profitable by the 5 Houses of the Star Supremacy, an elite society who looked to the sky and saw potential in the wasted planets. The opportunistic approach could hardly be considered an act of empathy for the human condition, as the decision to convert the dying planets into private prisons meant another type of life sentence awaited those shipped off to their remote reaches. Here, the desolate and derelict would burn away slowly, trapped in a race to death with the very ground they stand on. In this space, between the Well and unknowing.  

Our Story Starts there. Into our future, yet far beyond our past. In a romance between a pair of Unheavenly Creatures.

Weaving through the blacked out space toward the freckling of cracked planets, The Gavel moved like a funeral procession. In many ways, it was the end of life for the two prisoners being transported within its unmitigable walls, to the most deplorable and prized of the doomed prisons, known simply as The Dark Sentencer.

_YDuLCIzbN4,Ek3aeUhHaFY,Primitive Technology: Pottery and Stove,Primitive Technology,22.0,2017-12-22 20:41:23+00:00,[],13219076.0,248885.0,4430.0,15648.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_YDuLCIzbN4/default.jpg,"I made some pottery from the clay in the new area to see how well it performed. A large bank of clay was exposed by the side of the creek. I dug it out using a digging stick and took it back to the hut. Small sticks and stones were picked out of the clay and the whole mass was mixed to make sure there were no dry lumps. When this was done the clay was then left next to the fire to dry slightly so that it became a stiff workable material to form pots from. No further processing was done to the clay.
I formed small pinch pots from the clay by taking balls of it and pinching out the shape of the pots. Small cracks that formed while shaping were simply mended by wetting and smoothing over. Several pots were made this way. They were then left to dry completely next to the fire until they were completely dry. 
To fire the pot, it was placed upside down in the hot coals and covered with sticks in a tipi fashion. The wood both acts as fuel and protects the pot from sudden changes in temperatures such as those caused by sudden winds. When the fire was burning well, I increased the temperature of the fire by fanning it with a fan palm frond. The pot glowed red hot amongst the coals and so was fired to a sufficient temperature. After waiting overnight, the pot was retrieved from the ashes and struck with a stick. The pot gave a clear ringing sound indicating it was strong and had no cracks (hollow sounds indicate the opposite).  Now I had a small bowl to carry water in.
A larger pot was then made from the same clay. This time the walls of the pot were built up using the coil technique where long rolls of clay were rolled and then squashed onto previous layers. The last layer was pinched outwards to form a pot lip. A lid was made for the pot by making a flat disk of clay with a small handle for lifting. When dried the pot was then fired as before but in a larger pit outside the hut. Again, the pot was covered with wood protecting it from sudden breezes that might cool or heat the pot suddenly, possibly causing cracks. The firing went well and the pot sounded strong when struck.
The pot was then placed on 3 rocks and a fire lit underneath. It took close to 30 minutes to boil this way with lots of sticks. But it did eventually come to the boil. I then made a stove inside the hut. The fire pit was dug and extended into a trench, sticks laid over the entrance and mud mixed from the excavated dirt was then used to form the walls of the stove over the trench. The stove was about 30 cm internal diameter but came in to about 20 cm. Three raised lumps were made on the top of the stove to hold the pot above. Then the stove was fired. Note that wood can be placed over the entrance of the stove at ground level and lit in a hob firebox like configuration. The flames then get sucked down and then up into the stove. I show this because it‚Äôs an easy way to manage the fire without making it too big which might burn the thatch.
When the pot is on the stove, it‚Äôs easier just to put sticks straight into the top of the stove between its open top and the sides of the pot. If over stacked with wood, wood gas is produced burning in a second fireball above the stove. It‚Äôs best just to keep the flames big enough to surround the pot (to reduce fire hazards). The pot was quicker to come to the boil then over a three stone fire.
The clay here in the new place is good, it didn‚Äôt take me long to make pottery here. Notably this clay doesn‚Äôt seem to need grog or temper added to it to prevent it from cracking. I think this is due to tiny specs of mica that weren‚Äôt present in the clay from my old area. The clay seems stronger and there also seems to be much more of it everywhere. The pot boiled after a while of tending, in future I‚Äôll probably make thinner walled pots so that they boil quicker. The stove was useful for boiling the pot. It also seems to reduce the amount of smoke in the hut and increase the life of the coals in the base so that the fire could be re stoked at a later time.

Lyrics used in ""Troye Sivan - My My My! (Lyrics)""

Shine on. Diamond
Don‚Äôt make me wait another day
Cause passion is passion,
You know it just as well as me

Now let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let‚Äôs stop, my baby
Let‚Äôs stop running from us
Running from us
Let‚Äôs stop, my baby

Oh my my my!
I die every night with you
Oh my my my!
Living for your every move

Spark up.
Buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow. No, no go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let‚Äôs stop, my baby
Let‚Äôs stop running from us
Running from us
Let‚Äôs stop, my baby

Oh my my my!
I die every night with you
Oh my my my!
Living for your every move

Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we‚Äôre apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

Oh my my my!
I die every night with you
Oh my my my!
Living for your every move

You won't believe the amazing street food here in Kolkata. Indian street food and Indian cuisine is so diverse, and all over the streets of India, you can find so many varieties of Indian spices and flavours. In this video, Myself (Trevor James, The Food Ranger) and Ting are going DEEP for street food in Kolkata, trying some AMAZING Bengali Street Foods in Kolkata, and some AMAZING curry and biryani rice.

You can eat amazing spicy and flavourful mutton biryani rice, some super sweet and saffron packed chai tea, a ton of delicious street foods like the Kathi roll and a ton of specialties on deckers lane.

To start our street food tour, we woke up early in the morning to have an Indian Breakfast, an Indian street food breakfast! We went to a local tea shop to have some chai tea and a super delicious potato curry, known as a sabzi, and a flavourful kachori to dip it in! Watching the Indian restaurants and street food stalls like this in action, preparing and cooking the Indian recipes that have been done like this for generations is simply amazing!

After tasting that saffron and sugar packed chai, along with the amazing potato vegetarian curry, we kept exploring the back streets of Kolkata to try and eat the best street foods of Kolkata. 

Here, you can travel to India just for the food, and that's exactly what we did! 

After the tea, we went to find some classic Bengali street foods on the street corners, and found a super flavourful bhel puri AKA puffed rice with a spicy mango chutney! This was actually very sour and spicy and so delicious!

We then continued traveling in Kolkata's busy and spice scented streets for more delicious foods, and found the amazing hot kathi roll. 
This is marinated chicken in a ton of spice and yoghurt, wrapped up in a freshly fried paratha that's covered in a couple eggs, almost like an omelette, a HUGE omelette over top of the paratha! Then the paratha is wrapped up right on the street and you can taste the amazing flavors!

After that, we enjoyed a walk through the busy streets of Kolkata and made our way to deckers lane, the most iconic heritage street food mecca of Kolkata, to try an amazing and spice packed chicken stew. It was quite peppery and delicious! 

After a quick walk and one street orange juice later, we arrived at Arsalan biryani rice and curry Indian restaurant to taste the famous mutton biryani and also try the amazing selection of spicy Indian curries. These bengali specialties were simply delicious, a MUST try thing here in Kolkata.

Here are the addresses for the street food locations we tried in Kolkata:

1) Street Chai Tea with Aloo Vegetarian Curry at ATS Arun Tea Stall
2) Bhel Puri puffed spicy rice snack - New Market area street stall
3) Kolkata's Famous Kathi Roll at Kusum's Roll on Park Street, Kolkata
4) Famous Chicken soup on Deckers lane
5) Amazingly Fresh Orange juice right on the street right near KC Das Sweet Shop 
6) HUGE Bengali Indian restaurant dinner - Featuring Bengali Biryani spiced rice and a ton of delicious curry dishes - at ARSALAN park Circus

This is part 1 of 5 in our Kolkata Street Food tour series, and part 1 of many in our Indian street food tour series, we are going to keep coming back to India, probably twice per year, the street food and the local Indian recipes are just too good!

WHO DOES PRINCESS PEACH REALLY LOVE???
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr6Tp5vq3rg
_________________________________________________________

Disney movies were most of our first experiences with fairy tales. And when it comes to their princess stories, we know they can sometimes be formulaic. Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing, who doesn‚Äôt love a happily ever after right? We love rooting for the princesses to escape their evil stepmothers and be happy. But what if we told you the original stories from which Disney was inspired, were actually not so happy? We‚Äôve got a list of some pretty messed up origin stories. Did you know that Cinderella‚Äôs original story was much from gruesome? It ended up with her step sisters eyes getting pecked out.
And you won‚Äôt believe this. Rapunzel‚Äôs origin story involves her parents trading her for a salad. When she was in her tower singing, a prince walked by and climbed up using her hair. They fell in love and vowed to get married. When Gothel found out, she had Rapunzel banished to a desert and her prince pushed of the tower where he was blinded. He wandered around blind until he found Rapunzel and their twins. And did you know Ariel from the Little Mermaid, was actually in pain every time she walked? In the original story she didn‚Äôt get the prince, she actually turned into sea foam.
Want to know what other messed up origin stories made our list, watch our video and find out.

Warner Bros. Pictures‚Äô Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second of five all new adventures in J.K. Rowling‚Äôs Wizarding World‚Ñ¢.  

At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.  

In an effort to thwart Grindelwald‚Äôs plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.  

The film features an ensemble cast led by Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp. The cast also includes, Zo√´ Kravitz, Callum Turner, Claudia Kim, William Nadylam, Kevin Guthrie, Carmen Ejogo, and  Poppy Corby-Tuech.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is directed by David Yates, from a screenplay by J.K. Rowling. The film is produced by David Heyman, J.K. Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram.

Jordan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong‚Äôo, Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, and Sterling K. Brown opened to an incredible response from fans, critics and the box office this past weekend. If you remember a couple of weeks back, we did a Collider Scoreboard in which we asked members of the Collider staff and a special select few 6 questions about what might be happening in the movie and aske for a wildcard event in the film from them.

Host John Rocha is back with the two winners of the Scorebaord: Perri Nemiroff and Coy Jandreau. They go over the questions and their answers and discuss what did happen and what didn‚Äôt happen in the movie. They also explore some of the box office numbers and what we may get in the sequel.

I was so panicked thinking that we'd lost all our vlog footage (the day before we flew too!) because there was something technically wrong with the camera but luckily it was just 3 days worth of footage wiped (I'll have that chat I filmed with you in a week or so!) and I'll still be able to film in the Maldives now, phew! This week I attend the launch of the Good Girl perfume by Carolina Herrera (how amazing is the bottle?!), chat about my 2018 YouTube plans and discuss some new professional skincare I'm using :)

Vogue is a style of dance characterized by model-like poses with angular body movements. Vogueing started in the Harlem ballroom scene, an underground LGBT community. Most participants in ball culture belong to groups known as ""houses"" that serve as alternative families, primarily consisting of black and Latino queer youth. Vogueing gained mainstream exposure in 1990 when it was featured in the documentary ""Paris is Burning"" and Madonna's song and video ""Vogue."" Audrey practices and performs signature vogue moves including posing, cat walking, duck walking, and dipping.

We reveal the secret process of making Timascus (also called Titanium Damascus). Take a look at Patrick‚Äôs site and let us know which ring is your favorite.   We cut off a nice sliver of the Timascus and get to enjoy a nice fireworks show.  Then turn things over to Patrick to finish things off.  Patrick is a real client of ours and we cut meteorite and other materials for his ring making.  Also we gave Patrick a piece of the rattle snake we cut to turn into a ring‚Ä¶ follow his channel to see that in the future.

What should we cut next?  Browse all our videos in this playlist‚Ä¶  http://bit.ly/WJvideos

We do more than waterjet cutting!  Do you have an interesting video idea?! Let us know in the comments.  It could involve a hydraulic press, a waterjet, welding, machining creating something, destroying something‚Ä¶ let your imagination go wild.  I want to hear some really crazy ideas!

Lyrics:
Get it, text message I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but I'm never hurting nothing
Even then you don't worry none
And I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan
And shoutout to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We can keep the rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay lets rock and roll this
Time to go, lock stock and two smoking barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up to block and over
Times I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades Dior, my pants velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The games, a trap, protect, your heart (yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak we squeeze (squeeze)
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
She came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My vans, my braids, my mans, my babe
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped, out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

1) Mike Flanagan to direct Shining sequel Doctor Sleep (discussion: Should Doctor Sleep be a straight sequel to Kubrick‚Äôs Shining?)

2) ‚ÄòIndiana Jones 5‚Äô to Be Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Next Film, Followed by ‚ÄòWest Side Story‚Äô

6) Mail Bag

7) Live Twitter Questions

Deadline reports that Ouija: Origin of Evil and Gerald‚Äôs Game director Mike Flanagan has been set to direct Doctor Sleep, the adaptation of the 2013 King novel that is a sequel to one of King‚Äôs most famous novel‚Äôs The Shining. In Doctor Sleep, Danny Torrance is now in his 40s and battling the same demons of alcoholism that plagued his father. But when Danny embraces his sobriety, his shining returns and he finds a psychic connection with a young girl who shares his abilities. 

THR‚Äôs sources say it‚Äôs official. Steven Spielberg will reportedly tackle Indiana Jones 5 as his next project while he starts casting his West Side Story adaptation. The fifth film to see Indiana Jones on screen is set to be released by Lucasfilm and Disney on July 10, 2020. Spielberg is also reportedly taking his time casting West Side Story in order to find the pitch-perfect actors for the musical movie, which has not yet been dated for release. 

BOX OFFICE REPORT 

AGREE / DISAGREE

The Ritual tells the story of four old friends who reunite for a trip through the Scandinavian wilderness after the death of a friend. A wrong turn leads them right into a dark and mysterious forest where an ancient evil stalks them at every turn. 

A brand new trailer for Universal Pictures‚Äô upcoming Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again dropped during the Grammy Awards last night, focusing now on Cher‚Äôs role in the new sequel.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ex51a7Jfrs/sddefault.jpg,0.013500182345803288,0.0003934921806441405,34.30864197530864,0.00040008508314170544,0.013893674526447427,0.014293759609589134,2018-02-27,06:03:51,Tuesday,1,6,51,6,45,39,455,2,104,1,2,5,25,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.101601209442362,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

What are the odds of life on planets orbiting nearby stars? Scientists, wielding sensitive new telescopes and ""big data"" tools, have detected planets around thousands of stars; some Sun-like and some very different from our star. Many newly discovered ""exoplanets"" lie in ""habitable zones,"" where liquid water may support the chemistry that enables biology. How will astronomers discover if we have company in the cosmos...and where they live?

ABOUT US
Here at SpaceRip, we value the exploration of the unknown. We surpass boundaries for the sake of uncovering the mysteries of the cosmos and what they may tell us about our origin and our future. With our videos, we hope to educate our viewers on how we fit into the universe, and more so how we can do our part to better it.

We believe there is no better time to inform ourselves about the world around us. Our partnership with MagellanTV is aimed to educate viewers on our complex world to prepare for our rapidly changing future. Through our videos we hope to capture a variety of important topics with the overall goal of promoting positive discussion and action.

FAQ: http://bit.ly/2u9uJxX

The list itself is completely objective based on placings and players beaten. However, to create the X-factor a survey was conducted among a panel of community leaders, tournament organizers, and top players from around the world. The X-factor is the difference between their #PGRv4 placing and how they were rated by the panel.

From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals ""play dead"" as a survival tactic. But how and why do animals do this? Tierney Thys explains how this curious behavior, known as tonic immobility or TI for short, can be used as a defense or offense.

""On Friday morning, Fox & Friends host Ainsley Earhardt suggested that military strikes in Syria could be useful to divert attention from the unflattering portrayal of President Trump contained in former FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs book.

‚ÄúIf the president, and France, and the U.K decide to strike Syria, don‚Äôt you think that story would be a bigger story than Comey‚Äôs book that‚Äôs released on Tuesday?‚Äù she said.

Earhardt‚Äôs suggestion came while Trump is reportedly still considering a potential military strike against Syria ‚Äî and amid an edition of Fox & Friends that was largely devoted to sullying Comey‚Äôs reputation.‚Äù*

Thank you SO MUCH to my amazing friends, Joan and Talyn, who not only helped me analyze today's vines and brainstorm new takes on them, they also helped recreate the short videos, edited some of the retakes, edited all the vlogging portions of the video, AND helped create the thumbnail!

LYRICS - You Deserve Better


I‚Äôm just not sure my heart is working,
And yours is beating double time,
Deep down you know I ain‚Äôt even worth it,
It‚Äôs not enough babe, all I do is make you cry

Like ooh ahh, ooh ahh, I know, I do this every time,
Like ooh ahh, I know, but I just got to say what‚Äôs on my mind.

(Chorus)

You deserve better, better, better than me, might be what you want but I‚Äôm not what you need,
You‚Äôre better, better than you even realise...
You deserve better, better, better than me, might be what you want but I want you to see,
You‚Äôre better off without me in your life

And I hope you find somebody else
That will love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real
Oh I love you still,
But you deserve better, better, better, better


Give up on me coz babe I‚Äôm hopeless,
The more it hurts the more you try
You know I loved I just never showed it
It will be too late when you‚Äôre with some other guy


Like ooh ahh, ooh ahh, I know, I do this every time,
Like ooh ahh, I know, that I just got to say what‚Äôs on my mind

Chorus

You deserve better, better, better than me, might be what you want but I‚Äôm not what you need,
You‚Äôre better, better than you even realise...
You deserve better, better, better than me, might be what you want but I want you to see,
You‚Äôre better off without me in your life

And I hope you find somebody else
That will love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real
Oh I love you still,
But you deserve better, better, better, better

(Instrumental)

Might be what you want but not what you need, baby...

You deserve better, better, better than me, might be what you want but I‚Äôm not what you need,
You‚Äôre better, better than you even realise‚Ä¶
You deserve better, better, better than me, might be what you want but I want you to see,
You‚Äôre better off without me in your life

And I hope you find somebody else
That will love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real,
Oh I love you still,
But you deserve better, better, better, better.

These are the top facts about the relationship and marriage of Barack and Michelle and the truth about the Obamas‚Äô marriage!


6. Before the Presidency - Before going full-force into the kitchen, so to speak, Michelle and Barack had to decide whether or not they could take the heat. They wanted to figure out what political involvement could do for their more profound objectives involving social change. Considering Barack‚Äôs dreams of a more progressive society is one of the things that drew Michelle to him initially, it isn‚Äôt surprising that they would want the ultimate aim of his presidency to encompass those passions. Although he believed the best way to go about achieving these aspirations would be through politics, his wife tried to go around it, attempting change on a smaller scale through community organizations. They didn‚Äôt want their marriage solely based on government projects, but instead, wanted their union to magnify the goals they‚Äôd already set for themselves. This thought-process and pre-planning strengthened the couple‚Äôs relationship so that once he became president, the stress of the position wouldn‚Äôt tear them apart. Michelle backed him up throughout everything even though her early beliefs were against government involvement. It looks like it worked out in their favor and the two made an impact on societal standards that will last an eternity. 

5. During the Presidency - Michelle had a lot of say during Barack‚Äôs run for office and maintained an important position throughout his presidential career. However, she said she was by no means a ‚Äúco-president.‚Äù Although she and her husband discussed a lot of matters together, such as healthcare, and Michelle helped him in many ways concerning his public image, Barack made most decisions concerning things like military matters. She also remained focused on her own goals for societal change. In 2009, she put in a new garden at the white house to generate a discussion about the country‚Äôs welfare. Michelle began the campaign called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Move!‚Äù in 2010, whose goal is to create a healthier future for the nation‚Äôs families. The movement encourages fresh food choices, provides better options to school cafeterias, makes healthy alternatives more budget-friendly, and promotes exercise. So, even while Barack was making huge moves as president, Michelle was following her aspirations.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kOlrH0FXdg/sddefault.jpg,0.008987974124602281,0.0022363272732627308,4.019078169846361,0.0009627949597872641,0.011224301397865007,0.012187096357652277,2018-06-06,13:45:01,Wednesday,2,6,71,5,44,36,542,0,85,0,0,6,1,3,14,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6486580802488495,2,"['angry', 'sad']",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,{'person': 2},2

In fact, it‚Äôs a pretty widely agreed upon stance across the menswear world. But why? Why is a navy suit such a great choice for your first foray into the world of men‚Äôs tailoring?

If you ask me, it comes down to one simple priority ‚Äì versatility. When it comes to the foundations of your wardrobe, especially when you build from the ground up, versatility is key, and nothing is more versatile than a navy suit. Here are four reasons why:

1.Wear it (pretty much) anywhere.
2. Dress it up or dress it down.
3. Easy to match.
4. A strong separate game.

Here, I start out with a broad overview of where you could start and then where you could end up. I also provide a really easy way that everyone can create great stop motion videos for cheap!

If you want to test out this technique, it'll probably take you about 3 hours to do your first one. The cost is ... free if you have an iPhone.

For me, lateness is often a kind of weird procrastination. I decide to leave for a thing at the last possible moment, which is often significantly later than that. But punctuality is extremely valuable and valued in our society. There are huge benefits to being on time, everything from better relationships to higher income. It shows a capability for self control that some people have innately and others, frankly, have to hack their way toward. 

I'm working on getting myself there, but don't forget to also forgive yourself when you slip up and show up a few minutes late in the same way you would forgive someone else.

In this episode of Handcrafted, Haraguchi shows Bon App√©tit how to butcher a whole tuna and explains every cut of fish you would see at sushi restaurants. To do this, Haraguchi uses five knives: the Yanagi, which is used for slicing sashimi, the Mioroshi Deba filleting knife with narrow thin blade, the Deba single-edged knife used for breaking down the whole fish, the Gyuto versatile multipurpose chef's knife, and the Yo-Deba. He breaks down the tuna into back loin, belly loin, pelvic fins, bones, and collars.

It‚Äôs $200 more than the 9360 model, and as Dell promised it is faster than the 9360 and many competing 13‚Äù Ultrabooks thanks to performance tweaks. It‚Äôs available with full HD and 4K touch screen options, has a backlit keyboard, Killer WiFi, a Window Hello fingerprint scanner and IR camera for facial recognition log-in. The laptop has Thunderbolt 3 ports supporting 4 PCIe lanes and USB-C.

Hailee Steinfeld - Colour feat. MNEK (Lyrics)

[Chorus: MNEK]
Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white
Now all I see is colour
Like a rainbow in the sky
So, tell me your love will never fade
That I won't see no clouds of grey
'Cause I don't want another
You bring colour to my life, baby

[Verse 1: MNEK]
Life was so heavy, I was giving up, na-na
But since you came along, I'm light as a feather, ah
You give me something incredible, sensational, baby
When we're together, everything is better
My darling

[Pre-Chorus 1: MNEK]
Only you can brighten up my day
You make everything change, you rearrange
So don't go away
Let me tell ya

[Chorus: MNEK & Hailee Steinfeld]
Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white
Now all I see is colour
Like a rainbow in the sky
So tell me your love will never fade
That I won't see no clouds of grey
'Cause I don't want another
You bring colour to my life, baby


[Post-Chorus: MNEK]
Now all I see is colour
You bring colour to my life, baby
Now all I see is colour
You bring colour to my life, baby

[Verse 2: Hailee Steinfeld & MNEK]
I never thought that I would meet anybody
Who knows my body how you know my body (ah, yeah)
I can't deny I see us stick around 'cause we paint the town
Anyway that we want it
Like red and yellow and pink and green (shit)
That's what I see when you're here with me
Everything is brighter 'cause the limit is the sky
Baby, that's the way you make me feel
You know that

[Pre-Chorus 2: Hailee Steinfeld, MNEK & Both]
Only you can brighten up my day, yeah
You chase all those grey clouds away (you chase all those clouds away)
Help me find a brand new shade of me (me)
You make everything change, you rearrange
So don't ever fade (don't fade)
Don't fade, don't fade, don't fade, don't fade
You bring the colour, you bring the colour
Yeah, you bring the colour (oh, yeah)


[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld, MNEK & Both]
Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white
Now all I see is colour
Like a rainbow in the sky
So, tell me your love will never fade
That I won't see no clouds of grey
'Cause I don't want another
You bring colour to my life, baby (to my life)

Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white (now all I see is colour)
Now all I see is colour (now, all I see, I see, yeah)
Like a rainbow in the sky
So, tell me your love will never fade (tell me, tell me, tell me)
That I won't see no clouds of grey

Southern California fire is 'out of control,' forcing thousands to evacuate
Los Angeles County firefighters were battling a 1,000-acre brush fire Tuesday morning near Sylmar, fueled by powerful Santa Ana winds.
The Creek Fire is burning between areas that were previously scorched by the Station Fire and the La Tuna Canyon Fire.
Ventura disaster today, 
Ventura, California (CNN)Howling Santa Ana winds pushed a wildfire from rural hills into parts of the Southern California city of Ventura overnight with explosive speed, destroying dozens of buildings and forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
On Ventura's northern edge, at least 10 homes and numerous palm trees were burning in one neighborhood, sending thick smoke and dangerous embers into the gusty air.
By Tuesday morning, the fire had burned about 45,000 acres in 13 hours, and some homes were ablaze in the northern part of Ventura -- a city of more than 100,000 people along the Pacific coast.  
The Creek fire broke out off Little Tujunga Canyon Road around 4 a.m. and was threatening homes north of the 210 Freeway.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff‚Äôs Department was ordering evacuations in unincorporated areas. The Los Angeles Police Department was handling evacuations in parts of Slymar and Lake-view Terrace.
A large group of firefighters was on the scene, and up to eight water-dropping helicopters were hitting the fire, trying to slow its progress.
The blaze comes as firefighters are dealing with a fast-moving, wind-fueled wildfire that swept into the city of Ventura, burning 31,000 acres, destroying homes and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate. About 150 structures ‚Äî including at least one large apartment complex ‚Äî were consumed by flames, and many more were threatened as the fire crept about a quarter-mile from Ventura City Hall, ventura fire live.
Evacuation centers have been set up at the Sylmar Recreation

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_tzWd_8FpOM/sddefault.jpg,0.01912891480699789,0.00012628409670611065,151.47524752475246,0.00041136106748822183,0.019255198903704,0.019666559971192217,2018-05-01,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,8,37,8,32,53,337,2,76,0,1,6,16,0,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.142636973991142,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Hileman said an increasing number of central banks are looking to the system due to its resilience and transparency.

He adds that although blockchain could become important as banks move away from physical currency, there are privacy issues with the technology.

Lyrics: 

Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies
Thinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise
Tell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes
Watching as I say this and then I do that
Telling them the old words but in a new rap
Then I change my mind up and make them lose track
Shit I'm inconsistent I thought they knew that

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it I know

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't

Excuse me while I sympathize
Singing with the fat lady tell me what's the time
You know what it is not afraid to cross the line
Nothing is forever don't be mad at the design
Ask me if I can, I say I don't know
And honestly I buy that I can sound cold
Still upset from shit that's 15 years old
I don't know what it takes to make me let go
 
Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it I know

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below

""Girl Gang""

Hit hard cause a scandal
Can't stop I'm hard to handle
Don't care if my halo dips
My rise to this is worth the risk

Run fast put up a champion
One chance to make it happen
Don't care if my halo dips
My rise to this is worth the risk

We work work for the dollar dollar
Work work harder harder

I got fight I got heart
I got the strength to tear it apart
I got bite I got brains
I got to raise some power to reign

I run run the high road
I'm back taking my throne
I know the patriarch don't fit the part
What I'm gonna start

See now I'm the wild one
I stole the bones of Brando
I know the patriarch don't fit the part
What I'm gonna start

Work work harder, harder
We work work for the dollar dollar
Work work harder harder
We work work

It's a girl gang
Boy you wish you could join
It's a sure thing

It's a girl gang
Boy you wish you could join

Lyrics:

Living's like a jigsaw
And the farther in you go
If you're missing pieces
Never really know
When you're ticking like a timepiece
On which you can rely
Wonder why you wind it
When you're running out of time

Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

Living's supposed to kill you
But it shouldn't feel like dying
Loving's supposed to fill you
But it spills you like your wine
And all the paper people
Wandering about
Wondering who made them
And who's gonna cut them out

Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

And even in the morning
When the sun's behind the clouds
In the state you're born in
In the state that you're in now
Even if the roof is leaking
It's still above your head
Just remember two words that the two birds never said

Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

Marvel has finally released ‚ÄúThe Avengers: Infinity War‚Äù and we couldn‚Äôt be happier. There are superheroes flying all over the place fighting off Thanos attempting to take over the Universe. Even Spider-Man, Heimdall, Mantis, Groot, Winter Soldier, War Machine, and Black Panther are there! As our favorite actors such as Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, Mark Ruffalo, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Don Cheadle, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Evans! embody our favorite heroes, we wonder which one takes home the cake as the strongest!

Is it Shuri who will beat out Iron Man and Bruce Banner/The Hulk? Or will Star-Lord prevail over the other Avengers of Drax, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket? Are all these superheroes powers equal? Who faced Thanos with five Infinity Stones? What happened to The Vision and how does he make this list? Where does Thor land on the list, does his new ax Stormbreaker have an effect? Is Iron Man‚Äôs new suit, the Mark L, help him out? What about Gamora, Nebula, Drax, Loki, Wong, and Falcon end up? Who‚Äôs more powerful: Captain America, Doctor Strange or Scarlet Witch? The MCU is filled to the brim with superheroes all endowed with powers or brilliant minds to make powers, but where do they land in comparison with each other?

Watch this video until the end to see who is the strongest, most powerful heroes in the MCU! Bet you can‚Äôt guess them in order, give it a try and see if you agree with our order! Spoilers below!

Lyrics:
NOT WARRIORS
We tore our phones to shreds / We didn't answer nothing / To all friends and family: / Lost or dead. / I couldn't get much sleep / You lost your self in mine. / It couldn't get much worse / Than the best time of life. / There's nothing in my system / So I'm feeling what I feel for you. / I'm sweating out potential / But I'm nervous at my central for you. / There's nothing in my system / So I'm feeling what I feel for you. / There's nothing left to miss / Except the shots I take / And phone calls from you / Now I just need you to feel it too. / Our residence is in this bed. / All I want's The Office / And what's awful is‚Äî / ""Don't think like that."" / You couldn't get much sleep / I found you just in time / But hey / For what it's worth / I think you saved my life. / I think I'll die obsessed / Let's give up fighting back. / You don't need to grip the best / Because we're lucky people / And you'll never have to sleep alone.

CRYBABY
I just want to be invisible with you. / I drift in and out of time zones with you. / Just squeeze me until my skin turns to dark blue / My pity party's not the same without you. / I don't wanna be your crybaby / I don't wanna be your crybaby now. / You're the morning 
I can't wait to wake to / After chasing / You through my dreams in bloom. / I'll please you until / You're sick of me in full. / Maybe I can / Sleep through my mood until June. / Now I'm squinting at life through my sad, sour vision / Your silent sting concretely left my face twisted. / Your mess in my chest / Has me stressed and depressed / Do your eyes miss my name / When you check on your texts / Or not? / Nothing, nothing good comes from late night thinking. / Don't you, don't you know it's that Gloom Boy Season?

_________________________________________________________________

My name is Matt Estlea, I'm a 22 year old Woodworker from Basingstoke in England and my aim is to make your woodworking less s***.  

I come from 5 years tuition at Rycotewood Furniture Centre and 4 years experience working at Axminster Tools and Machinery where I still currently work on weekends. During the week, I film woodworking projects, tutorials, reviews and a viewer favourite 'Tool Duel' where I compare two cometitive manufacturers tools against one another to find out which is best. 

I like to have a laugh and my videos are quite fast paced BUT you will learn a lot, I assure you.

Lets go make a mess.

Our Story:

We are two guys, based separately in Philly & NYC, that share the same interest in listening to some great but not-so-well known music. Instead of continuously sending each other spotify links everyday and keeping the music to ourselves we figured we could try and do our part by sharing the music with as many people as possible on this platform (we also have a spotify playlist linked above of all of our uploads). Not all the music you will like, and to be honest, not all of the music that one of us posts the other likes either, but the fact that music can connect more than just one other person is the reason why we continuously post music from different artists, genres, and styles. Our intent is never to make profit off the songs we upload, we're just here to hopefully build a community that can share even more music than what we post. Thanks so much for the subs, likes, and views!

¬ª Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can‚Äôt see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I‚Äôm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don‚Äôt want no one else to see
‚ÄôCause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn‚Äôt help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I‚Äôm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me‚Äîmy friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, ""Screw her!""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

The genre-defining masterpiece Resident Evil 2 returns, completely re-built from the ground up for a deeper narrative experience. Using Capcom‚Äôs proprietary RE Engine, Resident Evil 2 offers a fresh take on the classic survival horror saga with breathtakingly realistic visuals, heart-poundingly immersive audio, a new over-the-shoulder camera, and modernized controls on top of gameplay modes from the original game. The nightmares return reimagined for the PlayStation¬Æ4 and PlayStation¬Æ4 Pro on January 25, 2019.

In Resident Evil 2, the classic action, tense exploration, and puzzle solving gameplay that defined the Resident Evil series returns. Players join rookie police officer Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield, who are thrust together by a disastrous outbreak in Raccoon City that transformed its population into deadly zombies. Both Leon and Claire have their own separate playable campaigns, allowing players to see the story from both characters‚Äô perspectives. The fate of these two fan favorite characters is in players hands as they work together to survive and get to the bottom of what is behind the terrifying attack on the city. Will they make it out alive?

üé§ Lyrics: GOLDHOUSE Feat. Cappa - Don't Go

Still feels just like yesterday
You were smoking on my porch
You know I hate but I stepped outside
And you said don‚Äôt go
And all the times when we drank too much
And we stayed in bed all day
Telling secrets to forget the world
And you said don‚Äôt go

All these things you did with me, did with me
Locked my feelings on repeat, on repeat oh
How you get so far from me, far from me
I still hear you saying don‚Äôt go
¬†
Don‚Äôt go¬†
I know it‚Äôs not over
I know it‚Äôs not over yet
Don‚Äôt go
Hold on to whatever
Hold on to whatever‚Äôs left

Still feels just like yesterday
You were laying on my bed
I looked at you and said it‚Äôs getting late
And you said don‚Äôt go
Now something‚Äôs changed now we‚Äôve grown apart
And we swore that wouldn‚Äôt be us
I know it‚Äôs hard and it breaks your heart¬†
But please don‚Äôt go

All these things you did with me, did with me
Locked my feelings on repeat, on repeat oh
How you get so far from me, far from me
I still hear you saying don‚Äôt go
¬†
Don‚Äôt go¬†
I know it‚Äôs not over
I know it‚Äôs not over yet
Don‚Äôt go
Hold on to whatever
Hold on to whatever‚Äôs left

Don‚Äôt go¬†
I know it‚Äôs not over
I know it‚Äôs not over yet
Don‚Äôt go
Hold on to whatever
Hold on to whatever‚Äôs left

check out caseys christmas video - ABANDONED MALL TURNED INTO WINTER WONDERLAND - https://youtu.be/0-7wMD5ISIs

I've done a lot of rad projects with Casey. 
None have been as special as this one. 
Last year Casey Neistat teamed up with Samsung to make that awesome HUMAN FLYING DRONE and WORLDS LARGEST HOMEMADE DRONE videos and they're making another! 
They invited a bunch of youtube buddies like myself, Peter McKinnon, John Hill, Sara Dietschy, SuperSaf, Sam Sheffer, Krystal Lora, Dotan Negrin, Rachel DeMita, Jesse Welle, Akila Hughes, Elle Mills, William Haynes, Jesse Driftwood, Mike Boyd, Molly B, and some REALLY rad snowboarders!!
Samsung got us OUR VERY OWN ABANDONED SHOPPING MALL and invited 100 kids to surprise them with an indoor winter wonderland. The kids got new Samsung S8 phones, we hung out, and sledded down the escalators. 
Seriously had The Best Day Ever with them!!

This is America (woo)
Don't catch you slippin' up
Don't catch you slippin' up
Look what I'm whippin' up‚Äù

OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT is executive produced by multiple Emmy¬Æ winner Stephen Colbert, Late Show executive producer Chris Licht and showrunner R.J. Fried. The animated series follows the tru-ish misadventures of the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, and his merry band of advisors and family members.
 
OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT examines the quintessentially Trumpian details of the presidency and his most important relationships, and no one is safe ‚Äì from his close family and confidants to key political figures from both parties and members of the media. In this parallel cartoon universe, the Commander-in-Chief opens the White House doors for an ‚Äúall access‚Äù look at a typical day in the life of the President of the United States. The series has introduced audiences to cartoon Trump‚Äôs attempts at ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the State of the Union address, comforting disaster victims and rolling back President Obama‚Äôs accomplishments, as well as his co-dependent relationship with the media. OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT is produced by CBS Television Studios. Tim Luecke serves as lead animator and co-executive producer. Matt Lappin serves as consulting producer.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a5iDw6lPjl4/sddefault.jpg,0.007266451245620083,0.0010744325152144457,6.763059701492537,0.0007697426974670657,0.00834088376083453,0.009110626458301595,2018-04-29,02:44:21,Sunday,6,11,63,11,58,81,536,2,95,1,0,8,12,2,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.7527544647101845,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

And why the Palestinians now say the US can no longer have a role in the peace process. 
 
It's a move that has made millions of people demand the US reverse its decision. From Asia to Europe, Africa to the Middle East, a feeling of unity and resistance.
 
And on the ground in the occupied territories, Palestinian resilience meets Israel's disproportionate force.

We look into why Jerusalem is central to the history of Israel's illegal occupation.
 
From north to south, east to west, the land is considered holy to billions; more than half of the world's population. We'll take you on a tour across the country - through the holy sites, past the checkpoints, and over the wall that separates families.
 
And, on this sacred eve when many people believe Jesus Christ was born, we find out the hopes and dreams of people living in the Holy Land, and explore what the future holds for a conflict that touches millions across the world.

 Following the worldwide hit ‚ÄúPaddington,‚Äù one of the most successful family films of all time, this much-anticipated sequel finds Paddington (Ben Whishaw) happily settled with the Brown family in London, where he has become a popular member of the local community, spreading joy and marmalade wherever he goes.  

 While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy‚Äôs hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber‚Äôs antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.  But when the book is stolen, it‚Äôs up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief.
 
 Reuniting many of the original film‚Äôs cast while welcoming those in new roles, ‚ÄúPaddington 2‚Äù stars Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonneville (‚ÄúDownton Abbey‚Äù), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (‚ÄúBlue Jasmine‚Äù), three-time Golden Globe nominee Brendan Gleeson (‚ÄúThe Guard,‚Äù ‚ÄúInto the Storm,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Bruges‚Äù), Oscar nominee Julie Walters (‚ÄúBilly Elliot,‚Äù ‚ÄúEducating Rita‚Äù), Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (‚ÄúIris‚Äù), and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (short, ‚ÄúFranz Kafka‚Äôs It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life‚Äù), with Golden Globe and BAFTA Award winner Hugh Grant (‚ÄúFour Weddings and a Funeral‚Äù), and BAFTA winner Ben Whishaw (‚ÄúThe Hollow Crown‚Äù) as the voice of Paddington.  The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (‚ÄúVera Drake‚Äù) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. 

 Paddington‚Äôs return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (‚ÄúPaddington,‚Äù ‚ÄúCome Fly with Me,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Mighty Boosh‚Äù) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúYonderland,‚Äù ‚ÄúMindhorn‚Äù), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  

 The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù films, ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,‚Äù Oscar nominee for ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupiter.  

 Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (‚ÄúTyrannosaur,‚Äù ‚ÄúSubmarine‚Äù), production designer Gary Williamson (‚ÄúBunny and the Bull,‚Äù ‚ÄúSubmarine‚Äù), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (‚ÄúWonder Woman,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù), and editor Mark Everson (‚ÄúMindhorn,‚Äù ‚ÄúAlan Partridge‚Äù), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them‚Äù) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (‚ÄúGravity‚Äù) and Glen Pratt (‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast‚Äù).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (‚ÄúAtonement‚Äù).  

 ‚ÄúPaddington 2‚Äù was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.

 Warner Bros. Pictures and StudioCanal present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, ‚ÄúPaddington 2.‚Äù  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.paddington.com

10. Telekinesis
It might seem odd that arguably one of the most beneficial superpowers are so low on this list, but it'll make sense before long. Telekinesis is the ability to move things with your mind. Seen by such comic book characters as Jean Grey, Professor X, and more, the stronger your mind is, and the more control you have over your power, the more you can lift. 

9. Immunity To Pain
Another interesting one, but also one that's dangerous in its own right, is being able not to feel pain. Now, you might think, ""Why would I want such a thing?"" Well, when your body feels pain, it doesn't just affect the body, it affects the mind and your emotional state. You have to react to the pain, or focus to block it out. 

8. Iron Suit 
If there's one thing that comics have taught us over the years, it's that you don't need to have ""real"" superpowers to be a superhero. Characters like Batman, Wildcat, and Iron Man prove that if you have the skills, you can do what's necessary to get the job done. Of those three, Iron Man has one of the most desired ""superpowers"" in the form of his Iron Man suit. 

7. Wall Crawling
Spider-Man is one of the most popular superhero characters of all time. And because of that, he is beloved for many of his powers. While I wish I was going to use this post about getting a real-life Spider-Sense, I sadly have to talk about one of his other powers. No, not webshooting, the other one, wall-crawling.

6. Bulletproof
Today's world is violent, massively so in fact. And one of the biggest perpetrators of this violence is guns. Many people fear being shot, so you wouldn't be laughed at for wanting to be bulletproof. There are many characters that are bulletproof for one reason or another. Superman is because of his connection to the sun, Luke Cage is legendary for his whole body being bulletproof because of an accident. 

5. Healing
While many superpowers are based on being able to do something offensively, or even defensively, one power that most people agree would be cool to have no matter who they were is healing. Made most famous by Wolverine, having a healing factor would be dramatically epic. 

4. Invisibility
When people ask each other what superpower they want, invisibility is often near the top, and it's not hard to see why. It's practical, used by my superheroes and supervillains like Invisible Woman, Doctor Doom, and it can be one that you can use in everyday life. It makes perfect sense why people would want it. So, are we close to it? Yes, actually certain variations of invisibility are available right now.

3. Super Speed
Ah, another one of the holy grail superpowers, super speed. The Flash, Quicksilver, Jay Garrick, and more have wielded speed for all sorts of great things...and bad things, but that's beside the point.

2. Super Strength
The OTHER major holy grail superpower is super strength. Being able to life up cars with one hand, or punch through solid stone without a scratch to your hand. It's a very pleasing and intriguing thought. Even though some of us would just want to be the Hulk so we could smash things...not me though!

1. Flight
The top 3 of this left are truly some of the superpowers people wish they had the most. But the biggest one in many polls is Flight. So many heroes and villains and characters fly there's no time to run them all down. However, the appeal of the power is worth talking about.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6QmVdBTf0g/sddefault.jpg,0.010825346748627231,0.001170744666450735,9.246547995341873,0.0019757168352148155,0.011996091415077969,0.013971808250292784,2018-04-28,13:00:01,Saturday,5,6,64,6,49,34,562,1,103,2,0,4,0,2,5,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.777861330402489,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

I added in the custom amber LED lights after the grill was completed, and that video will be posted as of 12/19/17. I will include a link to amazon for all of the products that I used to complete this project. There was a lot of custom work that went into this and I would only advise you attempt it if you are comfortable and confident in your own abilities. This is a DIY project and I am in no way responsible if you make a mistake or are unable to complete this project.
