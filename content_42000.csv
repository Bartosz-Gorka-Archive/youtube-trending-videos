Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

Roy L - Hey John! big fan, I saw Blockers and A Quiet Place and was blown away by both movies. Blockers had me laughing throughout movie, and A Quiet Place had me on the edge of my sit. My question is when was the last time 2 different movies came out at the same time, and just knock it out of the park? Thanks and keep up the fantastic work. 

PATREON Supporter Mickey Bell - Hi John! Happy Wrestlemania weekend! Do you think a movie about the very first Wrestlemania would work? Vince McMahon risking everything to hold the event, mixing celebs of the day like Mr T & Cyndi Lauper with wrestling, plus the wrestlers who feared they’d never work again if they did it. Would it be a compelling drama that could cross over to general audiences?

PATREON SUPPORTER Jeramine Sneed - Hi John love the show and all you do! Saw Black Panther just moved up to number 3 all time domestic. That’s awesome! However how do executives at WB have a job when BP Out grosses JL’s world wide Box office in domestic totals alone?!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLXzFlYJTok/hqdefault.jpg,0.02342042901548026,0.0022158618779429414,10.569444444444443,0.006032068445511339,0.0256362908934232,0.03166835933893454,2018-04-08,18:12:38,Sunday,6,16,15,14,15,98,122,2,28,0,1,14,15,1,0,5.0,7.0,"['=', 'i', '=e', 'nA', '= 5', 'wi', 'oN', 'i=', '=<', 'oD', '=', '=', 'ao', '=', 'Lu', '=']","['=', 'i', '=e', 'nA', '=', '5', 'wi', 'oN', 'i=', '=<', 'oD', '=', '=', 'ao', '=', 'Lu', '=']",True,"['=', 'i', '=e', 'nA', '=', '5', 'wi', 'oN', 'i=', '=', '<', 'oD', '=', '=', 'ao', '=', 'Lu', '=']",18,12,26,8,0,1,2,6.376345113966161,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

i made great friends this year. i remember moving and being so scared that i'd have nothing and nobody, but now this place feels more like home than anywhere else. i've made a little family for myself out here, and i am so so happy.

i'm currently sitting in my apartment, listening to old john mayer songs and packing because i'm flying to NY for the very first time tomorrow! i was planning on flying to texas to go get my wisdom teeth out and see friends, but my teeth had to be put on hold due to sudden changes in work. it'll be my first time in NY and i'm so excited! mostly gonna b in meetings but i'm still so excited. i feel like a big grown adult from sex and the city. carrie bradshaw here i come!

thank you guys for loving me. for caring about me and my silly life! i still find it hard to wrap my head around this all. i don't know if i'll ever really understand....

just, thank you. this was all because of you (even getting into ucla was because of you).

see ya in a week~

Today is day 8 of Vlogmas! In this video, Brooklyn and I hack the iPhone X’s Face ID! I recently got the new iPhone X, so we decided to put Apple's 'Face ID' technology to the test. Can identical twins hack iPhone X's facial recognition software? You’ll have to watch to find out!

We tested the iPhone X’s facial recognition software 2 different ways. For the first test, we wore identical clothes, hair, and makeup. For the second test, we dressed up as unrecognizable, silly characters.

Be sure to check back tomorrow for a Vlogmas Day 9 video, in which we go gift shopping with our siblings! Then, every day until Christmas, you'll find new daily vlogs for this year's Vlogmas! That means you get more BrooklynAndBailey every day!

2019 Avalon is underpinned by a Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform, and powered by a fuel-efficient 3.5-liter V6 or Toyota Hybrid System (THS II) powertrain.
 
To its menu, 2019 Avalon mixes a bevy of Toyota-firsts such as standard Apple CarPlay and Dynamic Auxiliary Turn Signals, available authentic Yamaha wood and aluminum cabin accents, and Engine Sound Enhancement. In addition, drivers will appreciate the standard passive and active safety benefits through Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), as well as athletic handling thanks to its available Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), also a Toyota first, that, quite positively, has Avalon out-performing its peers.

Pink SLAMS claims regarding her grimace facial expression during Christina Aguilera’s Whitney Houston tribute, during the AMA’s.
Intro: This episode is brought to you by T-Mobile. America's best unlimited network.

There were so many phenomenal performances tonight at the 2017 American Music Awards. From Selena Gomez’s return to the stage with her new hit ‘Wolves’, to Demi Lovato calling out all her haters right before she sang her unapologetic single, ‘Sorry Not Sorry’. One performance that took an emotional turn for the audience was Christina Aguilera’s Whitney Houston Tribute. Christina performed a medley of songs from ‘The Bodyguard’ in honor of it’s 25th anniversary.

During Christina’s performance, cameras captured reactions of celebs in the audience, and when doing so, managed to capture a less than enthused face from Pink.

Although the facial expression lasted a split second, a screengrab lasts forever. The pic quickly went viral and many expressed how they felt about it via social media.

Like this fan who Tweeted QUOTE “Pink's face about @xtina butchering every song tonight 😂😂 #AMAs2017 #ChristinaAguilera” https://twitter.com/alli_kuhl/status/932431226128003073

But before the internet had too much fun with the screen grab, Pink responded to all of the claims via Twitter saying QUOTE “Yes. THIS. Christina fucking killed it tonight for one of our favorite singers ever. This about Whitney, and I am in awe of Christina's talent.  Show the clip where I'm in tears, you negative Nancy's “
So it’s looking like maybe Pink did enjoy this performance as much as the rest of us. Sometimes we don’t realize the faces were making. But what do you guys think? Do you think Pink really did enjoy the performance and perhaps they just caught her at a bad moment? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. As always, I’m our girl Renee Ariel and I’ll see you next time.

In the early 1980s, the most feared battle MC in Queens, New York, was a fierce teenage girl with the weight of the world on her shoulders. At the age of 14, Lolita ""Roxanne Shanté"" Gooden was well on her way to becoming a hip-hop legend as she hustled to provide for her family while defending herself from the dangers of the streets of the Queensbridge Projects in NYC.

Today we are going to find out. Armor Max invited Dan and I to come shoot some of their armored vehicles, and the results re pretty amazing! Check them out here: https://www.armormax.com/

This is not a sponsored video. Its just super interesting to see how all of this technology works, and how Bullet proof cars are manufactured. There are several parts to a bullet proof car. The ballistic glass is pretty important. Its a layered slab of glass and plastic that stops the forward energy of the bullet.

Inside the metal paneling of your car are other bullet proof slabs. Some companies use heavy steel to block bullet penetration, but Armor Max uses a much lighter weight material that can even be used on bullet proof helicopters.

A Louisiana man was held in jail for over 8 years without ever getting convicted of a crime.A home was raided in which a small bag of cocaine was found, Kevin smith did not actually reside at the home but was arrested on drug charges nonetheless, because of his previous conviction the D.A. had the ability to prosecute him under the repeat felony statute in the state which would lead up to 20 years in prison.
It wasn't his home.
It wasn't his safe.
It wasn't his dope.
But a conviction was needed and he was an easy target. 

The system has no integrity or care for your life. 

Is this something you want to be a part of?

It is up to you to stay out of the system, don't expect help from it, its sole purpose is to enslave.

It's just for fun and isn't to jab at anyone in particular- both with those who've made these videos in all seriousness or those who've done these trends. (As you can see, I've already done most of these trends myself).

My philosophy is, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, you should do what makes you happy, even if it's trendy. On a real note though, don't feel obligated to do trendy makeup just to fit in, and don't do trendy challenges that are potentially dangerous (I even did the chubby bunny challenge in the past, not thinking about how dangerous that could be). It's easy to see a challenge going around and assume it's safe because everyone else is doing it, but it might not be .... Though I'm not sure why anyone ever assumed the fire challenge was okay to try.  DEFINITELY. don't do. that one. HAPPY NEW YEAR!

색소 없이 핑크색의 사랑스러운 핑크벨벳 케이크를 만들었어요~
홍국 쌀가루를 넣어 색을 내서 구웠는데 아주 조금만 넣어도 색이 예쁘게 잘 나오더라구요~!
촉촉한 시트와 라즈베리 잼을 넣고 만든 크림치즈 크림이 잘 어울려 맛도 정말 맛있었어요~*^^*
깨끗한 색감을 내고 싶어서 라즈베리 잼은 살짝 데워 체에 걸러 씨를 제거하고 사용했어요~ 
윗면에 흘린 화이트 초콜릿은 전자레인지로 녹이지 않고 중탕으로 녹여 사용해야 색이 하얗게 나온답니다~
저는 높이감 있게 케이크를 만들고 싶어서 시트를 2번 구워 도톰하게 잘라 사용했는데, 1번만 구워 3장으로 잘라서 만드셔도 좋을 것 같아요~^^
장식으로 사용한 리터 초콜릿과 복숭아 젤리가 사랑스러움을 더해주는 것 같아요~^^ 
즐겁게 시청하세요~♬ Enjoy~♪

Man what a time to be alive. Even with 7 tracks Mr. West shows how he's just a musical genius in and out. Having help from many artist such as Ty Dolla $sign, 070 Shake, Dej Loaf and The Cudderz himself you would expect nothing less than great from the Legendary producer,rapper, artist or whatever you want to label him as. He may be downright ignorant most of the time but there's one thing you cant discredit and that's his ability to make magical music!

Electric bikes are the transportation from the future! With peddle assist modes and full on no peddling transportation, these electric bikes are perfect for short commutes to school, or work. No car needed.  In this video I will test two different electric bikes. One from Ancheer. And the other from Rad Power Bikes.

Both bikes behaved in similar fashion. BUT we learned that the Rad Power bike has a motor TWICE The size of the Ancheer bike giving it a huge boost in power.  Acceleration and top speed. BUT to obtain that edge... you pay twice as much.

What do you think? Would you pay double for the extra power?  Let me know in the comments.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rbrkK3kcMKU/sddefault.jpg,0.053297944561853,0.0006635394652562298,80.32369942196532,-3.835488238475317e-06,0.05396148402710923,0.05395764853887077,2018-02-14,17:00:11,Wednesday,2,7,40,7,34,44,369,2,61,2,1,4,22,0,1,5.0,8.0,"['Ol', '(itn']","['Ol', '(itn']",True,"['Ol', '(', 'itn']",3,3,6,1,0,1,0,6.842762996967165,3,"['surprised', 'happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,1,0,{'person': 2},2

Giuliana Rancic interviewed Cardi B on the Grammys red carpet and to say that it was awkward would be an understatement.

Note to self, when you’re trying to ask an artist about a song they’re featured on, maybe don’t if you don’t know the words to the song.

You gotta love live tv because anything can happen. Awkward moments and all. When being interviewed by Giuliana Rancic, Cardi was just being Cardi and told G that not only does she have butterflies in her stomach, she has them in her vagina. Not awkward at all, it was really funny actually but I guess it came as a bit of a surprise to Giuliana.

And that wasn’t even the awkward part. Giuliana then tried to ask Cardi about a lyric she raps in “Motorsport” and she seemed to get just a tad bit confused.

Hey we’re all human. E! Live on the red carpet is exactly what it’s name implies, it’s LIVE so moments like this are bound to happen and Cardi was a really good sport about it, answered the question, and all was well. No harm, no foul. But the internet totally noticed.
One person wrote – “Giuliana Rancic just interviewed Cardi B on the E red carpet and it was painfully awkward . She didn’t know what to ask and it was obvious she was ‘out of the loop’ #millenialwoes” Another said - Giuliana trying to remember the lyrics to ""Motorsport"" live on TV has me CRYING. Y'all. ""You say something about going to the source."" #Grammys. Followed by – “Cardi B and Giuliana interview was so cringey ew.”

Heck I’ve done some awkward interviews too. It happens. Later on in the interview Cardi spoke about her wedding plans saying that it’s a little difficult to solidify plans when they’re both working on albums so there Is no rush. And there’s no question about whether or not Offset loves her Cardi says, because he bought her a half a million dollar ring. What do you guys think about Cardi’s interview with Giuliana?

When Erika Girardi made her 2015 debut on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, viewers instantly fell in love with the blonde bombshell. By day, she's the devoted wife to high-powered attorney, Tom Girardi, and by night, she's her alter ego: pop star, Erika Jayne. Initially, she was guarded when it came to disclosing personal details about her life on the show, but she slowly revealed a past that's been riddled with heartbreak — that is, before things took a total turn. Here's the untold truth of Erika Girardi...

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

Scott Disick, 34, and Sofia Richie, 19, finally become a thing on the Feb. 11 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, but first, the family has to get through New York Fashion week! Kim Kardashian, 37, is worried because her surrogate is starting to be photographed. Kim doesn’t want any more info about her surrogate to leak to the press, and she wonders what she can do about the situation. Scott decides to accompany Kris Jenner, 61, to Fashion Week, but Kim thinks it’s “bizarre” that he wants to go. “I think he wants to go and feel good,” Khloe Kardashian, 33, shrugs. “So, we’re gonna babysit?” Kim replies, still skeptical. Kris admits that New York City has always been a “temptation” for Scott, and she plans some activities for them to do together so he stays in line.

But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.

Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes.

In seven and a half years at the club, he’s won 18 official titles as part of one of the most glittering eras in its history. He made 334 official appearances under five different coaches:Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Tata Martino, Luis Enrique and Ernesto Valverde.

The first of those games was on 11 September 2010, a league fixture against Hercules at the Camp Nou. Although he was originally signed as a defensive midfielder, he was used at centre back to cover for the many injuries in that area of the pitch and did such a good job that he would go on to play just as often in that position as he did in the middle of the park.

For example, it was at that centre back that he played in, and won, the famous Wembley final of the Champions League.

There was something of an in-joke at the club about the fact that ‘Masche’, as his team-mates affectionately know him, had never scored a goal for the team, although attacking duties were never part of his game, so it should come as little surprise.  All that changed in a game against Osasuna last season, when he was famously invited to take a penalty – and scored at last!

Only thee foreigners have ever played more games for Barça than the ‘Little Chief’, namely Leo Messi, Phillip Cocu and Dani Alves.

Her nails have gotten quite thick and long.

Toenails can become thick for various reasons.  They can thicken with age, from injury, due to poor circulation, or genetics.  The most common reason that nails thicken is due to a fungal infection of the nail material, also called onychomycosis.  It can affect one or several nails.  It can be treated if caught early.   

The best way to treat fungal nails is to not let them become infected in the first place.  To prevent fungal nails, do not walk barefoot in public places, such as locker rooms, indoor pools, or gyms.  Use shower sandals.  Treat any changes you notice in the nails early, and treat any athlete’s foot infection quickly.  The fungus that causes athlete’s foot is the same fungus that affects the nails.

After breaking onto the scene with visceral, dark supernatural horror films Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, Guillermo del Toro moved into commercial American moviemaking, directing Blade II and garnering acclaim for his two Hellboy movies.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook 1: LV]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
 
[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Hook 1]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
 
[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Hook 1]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Hook 2]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Maybe not, but with friends, hookups, and a big hood concert, it just might.

Fortnite - the game EVERYONE is still talking about. Gamers love it. Parents and news outlets? No so much. They believe that the game is making players more AGGRESSIVE in real life. We see it in the news all the time! Parents freaking out about their kids playing THIS game or THAT game. But does Fortnite actually CHANGE who you are? Can it affect your personality?

What is ASMR? Here’s my definition: https://youtu.be/qAEM95ixp-s

Remember!
ASMR is not a medical treatment. ASMR is meant to induce tingles, relaxation, and sleep. Although it may make you feel better, it has not been proven to fix any mental health issues or conditions you may have. If you need help, PLEASE seek a professional. Here are a few links that can help you:

Everyone’s favorite daredevil Johnny Knoxville is back to his hilariously painful antics in the upcoming comedy ACTION POINT. Knoxville stars as D.C., the crackpot owner of a low-rent, out-of-control amusement park where the rides are designed with minimum safety for maximum fun. Just as D.C.’s estranged teenage daughter Boogie comes to visit, a corporate mega-park opens nearby and jeopardizes the future of Action Point. To save his beloved theme park and his relationship with his daughter, D.C. and his loony crew of misfits risk everything to pull out all the stops – and stunts – making for another wild ride from the star of BAD GRANDPA and JACKASS.

Countries that will be able to view the entire eclipse will include much of Russia and China, Mongolia, parts of Southeast Asia, Japan, almost all of Australia, New Zealand, Alaska (USA), the Western part of Canada and many Pacific islands and nations.

Many other countries will have a partial view of the eclipse, meaning the eclipse will begin before the moon rises or finish after the moon sets.

Locations that will not be able to view any part of the eclipse include most of Africa, most of South America and Western Europe.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

oooo surprise upload! this is my first makeup video since I moved! 🤩
I wanted to sit down and talk about what I've been up to since there's a lot going on in my life right now. But here's 30 minutes of me chatting and doing my makeup heh 😝 Grab your makeup brushes and let's get ready for the day together!

I've been more active on Snapchat lately so make sure to add me on there (@luxejessy) if you want to see more BTS of editing and what's going on when I don't upload (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃ 

What have you been up to this month? tbh I feel like April just started. this month has really been a blur for me. I'm still trying to transition into learning how to function as an adult (ew wtf are taxes 🤮) 
But good news, summer is starting soon (June 21 in the N. Hemisphere) so yay for more colorful makeup looks! 🎨 see u soon!

✍️ Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like your heart was the only one to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out, ooh
And you getting used to no one else being around

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two, ooh, ooh, ooh
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you

[Verse 2]
When it's Friday night and the drink don't work the same
You're alone with yourself and there's no one else to blame
When you still can't feel the rhythm of your heart
And you see your spirit fading in the dark

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two, ooh, ooh, ooh
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you

[Bridge]
When you're lost down the river bed, I'll be there
When you're lost in the darkness, I'll be there
I'll be there when you're heart is breaking
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there

[Chorus]
I'll be there, I'll be there for you (I'll be there)
I'll be there, I'll be there for you (ooh, ooh, I'll be there)
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two, ooh, ooh, ooh
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you, oh
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there when your tears are falling)
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there, can't you hear me calling?)
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I'll be there when you're heart is breaking)
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you, ooh

[Outro]
I'll be there for you, ooh
I'll be there for you, ooh
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, ooh
I'll be there for you, ooh
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you

So today I'm going to show you how to make some paper.

First a lil Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video.. What ever your making.. Make your next move with Squarespace. Get 10% off your first purchase:)  http://squarespace.com/shmoxd

So what you're going to need is a mold and deckle, a blender, a bin to hold water, a rolling pin, a lil plastic sheet, some paper to recycle, and something to soak up water.. like paper towel (or sponge or shammy).

To make the mold and deckle I used two picture frames, two wooden dowels, a drill, a staple gun, and a screen. (I'm the worst tenant in the world and just used a screen from one of my windows)

Remove the prints from the picture frames. I actually made the print on recycle paper. So thats cool I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Take out the metal clips that hold in the picture.

If you do the next part where I drill holes to put the dowels in as little guides, you'll want to make sure the frames a wooden. 

The dowels should fit snug in the deckle.. then make the holes a little wider in the mold so its not a tight fit.

After that cut out your screen to fit and staple on each side making sure the screen is fairly tight. Cut off the excess screen.

To make the pulp.. take the recyclable paper, tear it up, and put it in a blender with water. I got the blender from a thrift store.. cause I didn't want to ruin a nice blender. 

Blend it up till its to a consistency  where there aren't big chucks of solid paper... 

If you want the paper all white you can filter out some of the stuff with just water and your mold. You can also wash the pulp with dish soap or laundry detergent. If you want to bleach paper you can also do that.. just be sure to rinse out all the bleach. The mold makes for a good strainer.

Once you have your pulp add it to a tub of water. The water need to be about 2x as deep as the mold and deckle is tall. That way, you can move the mold and deckle around freely and the pulp mixture will go on top. Pull up the mold and deckle and the water will strain out giving you a nice even layer of pulp.

[ Oh! You can also add shorting to the pulp water mixture for some sizing.. this will help the paper be nice and strong.. ]

take off the deckle and put a screen on top. That way when you dry the pulp.. it won't stick to the paper towel ( or what ever you are using to dry) 

You'll see a little later in the video I figure out a better way to get the paper off the mold. You just hold the mold up side down with the screen on the bottom and blow off the paper. 

Then put the plastic sheet on the paper side, remove the screen and add a paper towel and use a pin roller  to get more water out and also that will shmoosh the paper agains the plastic sheet giving it a smooth side on one side.

I then went a little nuttso.. and tried adding a bunch of stuff to the pulp water mix.. like: Pressed flowers, felt, string, different colored pieces of paper, paint, copper flakes, sprinkles, pine needles, Christmas ornaments, candy, drugs, glitter, fish food, a taco, an iPhone, and oil.. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯  soooo you guys could try to put what ever you want in the paper mix.. my favorites were honestly the strings and felt.

SOooooo another thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring the video. If you guys want a website, url, online store or portfolio.. I like square space and you guys can use this link to get %10 off your first purchase: http://squarespace.com/shmoxd

AJ+'s documentary series on automation explores how advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning and automated vehicles will affect jobs, cities and inequality. From trucking to radiology, new technology is already changing white collar and blue collar occupations, reshaping cities and concentrating wealth in the hands of the few. Robots are taking over the world as companies like Tesla, Amazon, Uber and Google are using robots to automate.

The Philadelphia Eagles are your Super Bowl LII Champions, and Eagles fans are going crazy in the streets of Philly. They’re climbing traffic lights, destroying stores, jumping off buildings, and getting engaged. This is a compilation of the best from the night. 

Quarterback Nick Foles earned MVP honors after throwing for 373 yards, 3 touchdowns, and one interception that wasn’t his fault. Tom Brady had over 500 yards passing, but lost because he couldn’t cheat. Head coach Doug Pederson called a tremendous game for the Philly offense, and Brandon Graham made a clutch strip sack late in the 4th quarter to keep New England from mounting a comeback. Nick Foles also caught a TD pass late in the second quarter. Trey Burton was the QB on that play. I’m not sure if anyone thought this game would be an offensive shootout, but Rob Gronkowski, Chris Hogan, James White, Alshon Jeffery, LeGerrette Blount, Corey Clement, & Zach Ertz all scored touchdowns in the game. Bill Belichick and company tied the Denver Broncos for most Super Bowl losses with 5. The 2018 portion of the NFL season has proved to be very exciting, and concluded nicely with the Philly Underdogs getting a Super Bowl 52 win.

One of YouTube’s most famous names – Pewdiepie – is about to be officially off the market after proposing to his girlfriend!
This episode is brought to you by Secret Active. New Secret Active provides protection in the moments when it matters most.

Yep guys love is in the air and we’ve got photos of the engagement ring to prove it!

Pewdiepie – aka Felix Bjellberg popped the question over the weekend and asked his longtime girlfriend Marzia to marry him. She was the first to break the news, posting this photo with a caption that read “Felix proposed!” The pair has been dating for about 7 years and live together in the UK. Felix, always the jokester – posted the same photo as Marzia, with a caption that said “She said she’ll think about it…” Clearly he’s kidding. But one thing that Marzia was very clear about on her IG is the fact that the proposal was a private moment that they don’t plan to share. In another more recent photo on her page, she posted this photo teases an up coming vlog but also wrote: PS. No footage of the proposal, it was a private moment between me and Felix. Sorry guys!

Fun fact, this internet power couple actually met after Marzia was recommended his videos on YouTube. After she watched, she emailed him to tell him she thought he was funny and well, the rest is history. Whether they’ll share any of the details of their wedding we don’t know, but we do know the YouTube community is very happy for them – tons of congratulations message all over twitter! Our Clevver congrats go out to the fiances! You guys feel free to share some love in the comments too. And thanks for watching Clevver – be sure to subscribe for more updates!

Lyrics:
There's a war on love
Just look around you (look around you)
It's hard to know who to trust
I'm glad I found you (So glad I found you)
You and me, we climb higher
Baby, crescendo (we reach a crescendo) yeah
Got a love, it won't stop
It's that extendo (it's that extendo oh)
Korean missiles in the sky
No matter where I go on the map (on the map)
You got my protection, protection (oh my love)
Banana clip on my love for you (yeah)
Let it ring like (graa)
Yeah, I let it ring like (graa)
It's like I'm trigger happy (hahahaha)
Banana clip on my love for you (ooh)
Let it ring like (graa)
Yeah, I let it ring like (graa)
I guess I'm trigger happy (hahahaha)

Music by Nathan Gregory Wilkins and Richard X

Don't forget to subscribe to our brand new channel: LOVE TV! 

LOVE magazine’s Advent Calendar – the annual, seasonal online celebration of womanhood presided over by Editor in Chief Katie Grand – is now entering its seventh blockbuster year. Each year the number of viewers it attracts with its specially made Christmas- and New Year-themed videos has increased significantly, and this year it is expected to exceed the audience of 84 million that watched 2016’s LOVE Advent Calendar. ‘It’s festive, it’s fun and it’s everything we love about women enjoying being women, on their own terms,’ comments Katie Grand.
 
The list of models featured in 2017’s Advent boasts a best-yet selection of contributions from the girls who have helped make LOVE the go-to fashion title pushing the boundaries between art, edge and raw consumer appeal: Slick Woods, Winnie Harlow, Kendall Jenner, Stella Maxwell, Charli XCX, Taylor Hill, Kate Upton, Ashley Graham, Doutzen Kroes, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Jourdan Dunn and Karlie Kloss, among many others. ‘They all seem to really love contributing,’ says Grand. ‘Who doesn’t love Christmas?’
 
‘It’s a fun way to celebrate the year with the hottest women in the world,’ says Jasmine Sanders of her contribution. 
 
Emily Ratajowski comments on her video for LOVE Advent: ‘In the wake of women coming forward with incredible amounts of sexual harassment cases, I have been so disappointed to hear women talk about “modesty” and “our responsibility” as if we need to, yet again, adjust to make it “easier” for the rest of the world. I’m tired of having to consider how I might be perceived by men if I wear a short skirt or post a sexy Instagram. I want to do what I want to do.’
 
The process of creating LOVE Advent is a collaboration, explains Grand: ‘Everyone talks about what they want to do, a consensus is agreed and then we handle making the magic happen.’ Overseen by LOVE’s contributing fashion editor Sally Lyndley as Executive Producer, the videos for Advent 2017 have been shot by Phil Poynter, Rankin and Gia Coppola and feature exclusive soundtracks put together by music production partners Nathan Gregory Wilkins and Richard X.
 
The beginnings of 2017’s Advent took place in the New York gym The Dogpound, where Grand had booked in for three weeks of morning sessions while preparing for last season’s Marc Jacobs show. ‘I bumped into Ashley Graham there and she mentioned LOVE Advent,’ says Grand. ‘I thought, wouldn’t this be a great place to set most of it?’ When Grand approached Kirk Myers, The Dogpound’s founder and CEO, with the idea, he was delighted: ‘We are proud to train many of these remarkable women as part of their fitness regimens to #staystrong,’ he comments. 
 
The LOVE Advent season starts on 1 December but then breaks with convention on Christmas Day by continuing to unveil new exclusive video content each day well into the middle of January. ‘When you have a jolly idea,’ explains Grand, ‘it seems a shame to end it during what can be the least jolly week of the year.’ 
 
LOVE Advent 2017 could not have happened without the help of our kind sponsors: Agent Provocateur, Burberry, Coach, Alain Mikliand Marc Jacobs Beauty.

Synopsis: When Drew’s daughter begins suffering from nightmares, he must face his horrific memories with his former classmate and fellow survivor of the Elm Street Haunting in order for them to save his daughter and put an end to their childhood tormentor once
and for all.

This is one of three trailers we've made. There won't be any films to follow. These were strictly just to be made as FAN trailers, from a feature film idea for nightmare on elm street. We really hope you guys enjoy, and if you do please pass it along! Hopefully someone form Warner Brothers catches sight.

Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it’s a little more complicated: he’s yet to tell his family or friends he’s gay and he doesn’t actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing. Directed by Greg Berlanti (Dawson’s Creek, Brothers & Sisters), written by Isaac Aptaker & Elizabeth Berger (This is Us), and based on Becky Albertalli’s acclaimed novel, LOVE, SIMON is a funny and heartfelt coming-of-age story about the thrilling ride of finding yourself and falling in love.

Directed by: Greg Berlanti

Produced by: Wyck Godfrey and Elizabeth Berger
Screenplay by: Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger
Based on novel by: Becky Albertalli

Cast: Nick Robinson, Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Miles Heizer, Keiynan Lonsdale, Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, Tony Hale

Subscribe to our channel : http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Batman's arch-nemesis The Joker is, without any shadow of a doubt, one of the most iconic and terrifying villains in all of fiction (in any media) - and he's definitely the most recognisable villain from the world of comics. However, the versions of the twisted ""Clown Prince of Gotham"" you've probably seen or heard about in the main continuity of DC Comics and on the big screen in Hollywood movies aren't the only versions of the character to have existed over the years. In this video, well run you through ten versions of the character that you might not be so familiar with. Those versions are; Cesar Romero's very camp version from the 1960s Batman television series, the reality-warping Emperor Joker from the comic book story arc of the same name, the Jokers own daughter Duela Dent, the Amalgam Comics character Hyena (an amalgamation of Joker and the Marvel character Sabretooth), the Martha Wayne (Bruce Wayne's mother) version of the character from the Flashpoint story arc, the future version of the Joker from the Batman Beyond animated series (who is actually Tim Drake, the former Robin), the Neo Joker (who is actually Harley Quinn) in the White Knight comic book title, the Laughing Man (a cyborg) from the Batman: Nosferatu comic book story, the gangster Bianca Steeplechase from DC's Earth-37, and the Japanese Joker from the new Batman Ninja anime. We hope you enjoy the video and make sure you let us know what you think of it by leaving your thoughts in the comments section!

how are you today?
This video is about the BTS savage moments and their dissing times.
I think that they are really funny and are very natural. The bangtan boys are hardworking and kind and this are the traits which defines them as a group.
You’re about to see V being nice to Jimin only after knowing that he’s been recorded. xD
If we’re still talking about V then you should definitely hear his opinion about Jin after he was teasing him. 
Taehyung said that the eldest hyung’s personality has become weird. He also felt the need of adding that Jin was previously handsome and cool. So, who’s the disser? xD
For more BTS funny and more savage moments please watch the video!
Enjoy!

Check out ProPublica’s feature story on the use of the Alford plea here: https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty

In 1987 police detectives — who’d later be made famous by David Simon, creator of “The Wire” —  used flimsy evidence to pin a burglary, rape and murder case on James Thompson and James Owens. They were both sentenced to life in prison. Then 20 years later, DNA evidence cleared each of them of the rape and unraveled the state’s theory of the crime. But instead of exonerating the two men, prosecutors dangled the prison keys, pushing them to plead guilty to the crime in exchange for immediate freedom. What prosecutors offered was a controversial deal called an Alford plea. Last year, ProPublica investigated prosecutors’ use of Alford pleas and similar deals in cases of wrongful convictions, and found they often cover up official misconduct. Check out the story of the two Jameses above to see what happened after the Alford plea was offered in their cases.

The women who don’t comply with the country's 1979 compulsory hijab law can face fines or jail time for the brazen act. And yet, a wave of hijab protests since January have shown women openly defying the law, filming public acts of unveiling that have been widely shared online. In response, the government has arrested at least 29 women; one has already been sentenced to two years in prison.

As the Iranian women forge ahead, their acts of civil disobedience have been amplified by two social media accounts curated by Masih Alinejad, a Brooklyn-based Iranian activist and journalist living in exile. Her personal Instagram and ""Stealthy Freedom"" Facebook pages are the source of a host of civil disobedience campaigns, including #WhiteWednesdays, where women take off their headscarves and wave them.

The encrypted messaging app Telegram, also popular in Iran, is currently the app of choice for Iranian women joining the hijab protests. Though it was recently restricted, joining Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, on a list of banned social media sites used to mobilize anti-government protests, the women are still bypassing internet censors to post their hijab-less images.

VICE News spoke to Masih Alinejad about how the online protest movement gained momentum — and where it's going from here.

I've been flying since I was 16 and at age 19 flew around the world by myself in the same 1981 A36 Beechcraft Bonanza I still fly, becoming the youngest person ever to solo circumnavigate by aircraft. 

Now, I'm sharing all kinds of aviation adventures with YOU! Ride along as we explore the world from the air and get a close up look at some of aviation's best flight experiences and destinations.

YouTuber Logan Paul is no stranger to pulling stunts for attention, but his most recent video saw him showing off a recent suicide victim in Japan. YouTube content creators are criticizing Paul for crossing the line and demanding a response from YouTube. YouTube is... not too fussed about it, apparently.

In a recent tweet, Stone Mound Meezy—21's manager—said the ""Rockstar"" chart-topper ""no longer wears jewelry."" Instead, Meezy said, 21 wants to make things like buying houses and investing in businesses ""cool"" for young artists to do. These tweeted goals arrive just after 21 announced a joint tour with his ""Rockstar"" collaborator Post Malone. The tour, kicking off April 26 in Portland, boasts support from SOB x RBE and Paris on select dates. Tickets are now available.

There are tons of things I had never considered about how difficult it is to fool your brain into thinking it's touching something it's not.  I think the most important technical issue to overcome is timing.  Much like how your brain can understand hearing someone's voice AFTER seeing their lips move, but not the opposite... the lag time of the sense of touch is an important thing for your brain.  Another thing I hand't considered is the ""rise time"" that has to do with internal stresses in your fingers.  If you conceptualize your fingers as water balloons around bones, you can understand how the internal pressure of your fingers rise the harder you press something.  This type of information coupled with the ""Sensory Homunculus"" make for some incredibly fulfilling thought experiments.  

The temperature question is something I'm particularly interested in.  Using a colder fluid to model a room temperature fluid because of the heat transfer equation is a fascinating area of scientific problem solving.  If you think it through, everything about this boils down to differential equations.  How much heat is leaking out of the hand, and at what rate, through what contact area?

I asked HaptX for a blurb to explain their company.  This is what they came up with:

HaptX is a multidisciplinary team of engineers based in San Luis Obispo, CA and Seattle, WA that builds advanced haptic technology. Their first product, HaptX Gloves, brings touch feedback to VR with unprecedented realism, enabling a new category of industrial training simulations. Founded by Jake Rubin and Dr. Bob Crockett in 2012, HaptX won’t stop until you can’t tell what’s real from what’s virtual. Learn more at haptx.com.

What a week! Over the past seven days, our Pokémon GO Travel hosts, iHasCupquake, Coisa De Nerd, and Rachel Quirico, took us on all kinds of adventures across Japan. We’ve been to Tokyo Tower for a Tyranitar Raid Battle, to the foot of Mt Fuji to catch a Lapras, to the streets of Kyoto for a Stardust challenge, and finally to the dunes of Tottori to play alongside thousands other Trainers during the Pokémon GO Safari Zone event. 
 
Meanwhile, millions of Trainers from more than 140 countries participated in the Pokémon GO Travel Global Catch Challenge, where they came together to collectively catch over 3.36 billion Pokémon in under 7 days. After this incredible milestone was reached, Farfetch’d began appearing worldwide, Kangaskhan was spotted in East Asia, and Ho-Oh started appearing in Raid Battles for the very first time. Now it's your turn to get in on the action. Grab your friends and battle Ho-Oh in Legendary Raid Battles at Gyms near you before it disappears on December 12, 2017!

“It’s not an illustrious category to belong to of course, but there are plenty of us at least. We worry about work, money, being left, illness, disappointing, over-promising, madness and disgrace, just to start the list.

It can feel pretty unbearable, at moments.…”

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

In the jewel-bright Aegean Sea, a small Greek island holds an ancient mystery. 4,000 years ago, Dhaskalio was a promontory connected to its larger neighbor, the island of Keros. On this pyramid-shaped hill stood a sanctuary where visitors brought intentionally broken statues. A complex of buildings and terraces grew built with many tons of marble quarried on another island. Water conduits ran through the complex, advanced engineering for the age. In the 3rd millennium BC, Keros was becoming one of the Greece's first urban centers. But what made the sanctuary sacred in the first place is yet to be discovered.

A few more thoughts on the Nerf Cannon.
Yes, I know if I used a longer barrel I could get higher speeds, but I did not want to deal with a 20ft long gun. I think a 6ft barrel was enough to show what a supersonic nerf dart can do. 

Davekni got a pingpong ball going 2000mph which is 2930 ft/s!! (mach 2.5). His barrel was 20ft long. It can shoot through 3/4in plywood! You can see that video here- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuwu4gjNbQ

I always thought the speed of sound was the limiting factor, because the flow 'chokes' at mach 1. Its a big controversy among air-gunners, and theres like a 900 post topic on it here https://www.gatewaytoairguns.org/GTA/index.php?topic=102604.540.  Some guy got one going like 2100 ft/s which I thought was impossible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUq4OQqZ2bw So it prompted me to do some research.

It turns out flow does choke at mach 1, but its only the mass flow that chokes. The gas can still expand supersonically.



Also a big thanks to Dr. Carl Knowlen from University of Washington, and u/Overunderrated,  u/TheQueq, and u/InductorMan from reddit.





Here are the papers I referenced:

A COMPARISON OF DISTRIBUTED INJECTION
HYPERVELOCITY ACCELERATORS - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268456817_A_comparison_of_distributed_injection_hypervelocity_accelerators
 Probably the most concise and easily understood!


Numerical Evaluation of a Light-Gas Gun Facility for Impact Test
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270629342_Numerical_Evaluation_of_a_Light-Gas_Gun_Facility_for_Impact_Test
Shows different muzzle velocities for different barrel lengths


THE THEORY OF HIGH SPEED GUNS
http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/475660.pdf
Probably the most extensive on the subject ""The reader Is assumed to be an advanced student in engineering."" I hope you payed better attention in physics that I did.

Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time opens in theatres March 9th!

From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.

Nicki Minaj has cemented herself at the top of the music charts thanks to her catchy beats and flawless lyrics. Her fans just can’t get enough of her, and the entertainment industry always makes sure she’s front and center at A-list events. But there are some celebs who are sick and tired of Nicki. They’ve publicly bashed her online, in interviews, and on national television. From Drake to Gucci Mane, Demi Lovato, and Mariah Carey, let’s take a look at the superstars who aren’t a fan of the Queens, New York rapper. This is 20 Celebs Who Dissed Nicki Minaj.

When Taylor Swift dissed Nicki for her remarks about the nominees of MTV’s VMA Video of the Year category, Swift found some support from Miley Cyrus. Cyrus said Nicki wasn’t very “polite,” and she said the rapper wasn’t too kind either. We’re sure Farrah Abraham would agree with her. Watch our video to see how her feud with Nicki spiraled out of control!

Nicki has used her songs as a way to take digs at some of her competitors, including rapper Remy Ma. Remy fought back by claiming Nicki had gone under the knife and had hooked up with singer Trey Songz on her diss track called “ShETHER.” When Trey heard the allegations, he decided to stay out of the mix and stay focused on his work, and that really riled Nicki up! Watch our video to see how it all played out.

If you think these disses are bad, wait until you hear how Tyga, Drake, Cher, Azealia Banks, Cardi B, Rihanna, Iggy Azalea, Lil Kim, Laura Saltman, Billy Bush, Eve, and Lil Mama dissed her. Let us know if you think any of these celebs went too far with their digs at the “Anaconda” rapper.

The joyous celebrations are continuing in the streets of Zimbabwe following President Mugabe’s resignation. Mugabe resigned a short while ago in a letter submitted to parliament. Wild jubilation broke out among MPs when Speaker Jacob Mudenda told the House. His letter reads as follows: “I Robert Gabriel Mugabe hereby formally tender my resignation as President of Zimbabwe with immediate effect. 
These residents say they will never allow another leader to stay in office this long.” Zimbabwe’s former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will be sworn in as president on Wednesday or Thursday. Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front’s legal secretary Patrick Chinamasa has confirmed this after the resignation of Robert Mugabe earlier on Tuesday tonight. ZANU-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke says that Mnangagwa will serve the remainder of Mugabe’s term until the next general elections, which must be held by September 2018.

  Dolores O'Riordan, lead singer of Irish band the Cranberries, has died at the age of 46. 
  In a statement, her publicist said she suddenly died on Monday in London, where she was recording, but didn't provide further details, including the cause of her death. 
The Cranberries rose to global fame in the early-1990s with a string of hits, including ""Linger"" and ""Zombie,"" and went on to sell over 40 million records worldwide. 
Personal dedications to the late singer have flooded social media, with fans and fellow musicians paying tribute.

While down at the Matterhackers / Ultimaker meet-up, I had some questions about resin print finishing, and Alec said we could do a walk-through on how he finishes prints from the Moai.

Peopol Moai from Matterhackers (aff):
http://3d.pn/moai

I did have a decent idea on what to do, but I didn't know an ultrasonic cleaner would help so much, I didn't know the gloves should be nitrile, and I didn't know clipping supports BEFORE curing was a good way to do it! Learning is fun!

Also, while this information and process may be remedial to some, it's going to be new to others. So, if this video isn't for you, I won't be offended if you do not watch it. HOWEVER, I think it's only fair you leave a comment with your best dad joke. :)

During their 20-plus years behind bars, technology has changed the outside world dramatically.

The criminal justice system has changed, too, becoming more forgiving of people who commit crimes as juveniles. Since 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court has slowly chipped away at harsh, mandatory sentences for kids, ultimately finding in 2012 that it’s unconstitutional to sentence juveniles to life without parole.

This year, Colorado started an early-release program for people convicted as juveniles who have already served 20 years of their sentences. To get ready for life on the outside, inmates in the three-year program use virtual reality to prepare for stressful situations and practice skills they never learned as teens, like doing laundry and grocery shopping.

Lyrics: 

I fell out of my lane 
Cause I must have lost my tolerance 
Been covering my pain 
talking to a quiet audience

I knew that crash was comin’ man 
I felt it in my blood 
Great grandma was a voodoo girl 
She told me about the flood 

She said 
Boy 
You are a run away 
You won't have nothing in your hands 
until you give it all away 
Boy you are a runaway
And nothing's gonna change
unless you change

I'm sorry I can't talk right now 
Some things are out of my control 
My fathers in the jail house 
No, I think he’s at the hospital

My mother is incredible 
She’s held us for so long 
She’s like the breath behind my words 
should have the rights to all my songs yea
 

She said 
Boy 
You are a run away 
You won't have nothing in your hands 
until you give it all away 
Boy you are a runaway
And nothing's gonna change
unless you change


I’ve always been a shy kid 
There's a shadow in my name 
I learned a pose to deal with it 
I've had a taste of fame 

But something's always holding back 
My politeness Isn't faux 
But it's never done me any good 
I should probably let it go 


and say 
boy 
You are a run away 
You won't have nothing in your hands 
until you give it all away 
Boy you are a runaway
And nothing's gonna change
unless you nothing’s gonna change unless you change 

Then out of nowhere 
I’m leaning in your window singin
songs out of my soundtrack 
playin back 
permanently into your heart 

boy boy you are a run away 
boy boy nothing in your hands
boy boy you are a run away 
boy boy riding on the last wave",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s7wgTqJRj0k/sddefault.jpg,0.01003479110957762,0.00020127088185399242,49.85714285714285,0.0011213663417579574,0.010236061991431613,0.011357428333189569,2018-04-27,04:03:09,Friday,4,7,70,7,41,41,418,3,74,1,0,5,7,0,13,5.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.543464931787479,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'cup': 1},1

This Deepstaria jelly awed us with its shapeshifting abilities as its bag-like bell inflated and undulated with current created by movement of ROV Hercules. Capturing prey in its voluminous bell, a strikingly geometric network of canals delivers nutrients throughout this large jelly’s body.

This close encounter was captured with both our normal ROV Hercules HD camera and a low light camera for bioluminescence designed by Dr. Brennan Phillips at University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography and David Gruber at the City College of New York/Baruch College.

Lyrics:

Weirdness follows me wherever I go
Weirdness seems to know me even better than I seem to know myself
I'm someone else
Looking to the clock beside my bed
Am I really keeping time or is it only keeping me instead?
Go back to bed

Woah woah woah woah
You've got time to grow
Oh soldier, take your time
No one said the words all have to rhyme, and if they do it's fine
And even if they don't, no one needs to know
Woah woah soldier, you gotta let things go

An hour hand moves faster with a scotch
Even when you're in it moving faster every minute if you watch
And I drink a lot
But drinking only wakes you up at ten
Spend the day regrettin’, but I'm bettin’ that you'll do it all again
Next weekend

Woah woah woah woah
You've got time to grow
Oh soldier, take your time
No one said the words all have to rhyme, and if they do it's fine
And even if they don't, no one needs to know
Woah woah soldier, you gotta let things go

Don't look down the barrel with an arrow and a bow
Dressed down in apparel with camouflage from head to toe
With everything so sterile in a heavy monotone
Oh soldier, you gotta let things go

Oh soldier, take your time
No one said the words all have to rhyme, and if they do it's fine
And even if they don't, no one needs to know
Woah woah soldier, you gotta let things go

United by Love fue compuesta para la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de Rusia 2018.

La canción es una fusión de 3 idiomas: inglés, español y ruso, y habla sobre la paz, el amor y la importancia de la unión entre los seres humanos  mediante un evento de gran magnitud y tan popular como lo es la Copa Mundial en una fusión entre pop, urbano, cumbia, candombe y elementos rusos como la balalaika y el acordeón fueron algunos de los elementos los productores han contemplado para el desarrollo de este nuevo single que acompaña la fiesta mundialista.

Para la creación de “United By Love”,  Oreiro contó la colaboración exclusiva de dos grandes productores discográficos: Ettore Grenci y Diego Córdoba, quienes han trabajado con artistas de la talla de Demi Lovato, Marc Anthony, Ariana Grande y Meghan Trainor, entre muchos otros.

1) X-Men/Deadpool Joining MCU Says Disney

2) James Wan Says ‘Aquaman’ Does Not Have Three Villains

3) First Poster for ‘Ocean’s 8’ Assembles a New Team

4) New ‘Deadpool 2’ Art Teases the Second Coming with Cable

5) 'John Wick' Director Tackling Ed Brubaker Comic 'Kill or Be Killed'

6) Marlon Brando Memoir Optioned by Brian Oliver for Biopic Treatment

7) Mail Bag

After the monumental news broke early Thursday that Disney had purchased a sizable chunk of 21st Century Fox, talk immediately turned to the X-Men and Fantastic Four and whether they could possibly join the Avengers in a movie later on down the line. During a conference call with investors, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that the MCU will expand to include those properties including Deadpool. 

With Justice League in the rearview mirror, fans are now looking to next year’s Aquaman to see what else Warner Bros.’ DCEU will bring to the table. James Wan has now finished production and is on to post-production, with speculation from fans now wondering if the movie will feature three villains. This comes from casting announcements that have Patrick Wilson playing Aquaman’s half-brother Orm (aka the Ocean Master), Abdul-Mateen playing Black Manta, and Dolph Lundgren playing King Nereus. According to Wan himself, however, that’s not the case. 

BUY OR SELL

Warner Bros. has released the first Ocean’s 8 poster for the upcoming spinoff from Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy. Hunger Games filmmaker Gary Ross directs the new film, which stars Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the sister of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean. 

The marketing for Deadpool 2 continues with star and producer Ryan Reynolds revealing a new banner on his Twitter account. Atomic Blonde’s David Leitch steps into the director’s chair this time around, with Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beets’ Domino introduced to the cast.

THR reports that John Wick director Chad Stahelski is reteaming with his 'Wick' producer Basil Iwanyk to adapt the Ed Brubaker comic Kill or Be Killed. The movie tells the story of a depressed college student who attempts suicide only to survive due to unlikely events. 

THR reports that a biopic about Marlon Brando is in the works, with Brian Oliver's New Republic Pictures optioning the memoir by George Englund entitled The Way It's Never Been Done Before.

A letter from Mr Mugabe said that the decision was voluntary and that he had made it to allow a smooth transfer of power, the Reuters news agency reports.
The surprise announcement halted an impeachment hearing that had begun against him.
Lawmakers roared in jubilation and people have begun celebrating in the streets.
Mr Mugabe had previously refused to resign despite last week's military takeover and days of protests.
He has been in power since independence in 1980.

To save their friends, they must break into the legendary Last City, a WCKD-controlled labyrinth that may turn out to be the deadliest maze of all. Anyone who makes it out alive will get answers to the questions the Gladers have been asking since they first arrived in the maze.

Selena Gomez is getting slammed for possibly lip syncing her first live performance of “Wolves,” but it turns out that rumor may NOT be true.

Selena Gomez’s performance of “Wolves” at the 2017 American Music Awards was a huge deal, but it was tainted with the possibility that she was lip syncing.

Everyone was waiting with bated breath for Selena Gomez to take the AMAs stage for the first time since her life-saving kidney transplant to perform her new single with Marshmello “Wolves.” When the moment finally happened, fans were obviously super excited, but that quickly turned to confusion when they realized the audio sounded a bit too perfect to be a live performance. Let’s take a listen.

Sources close to Selena tell TMZ, however, that she was NOT lip-syncing during the performance...for the most part, at least. The insider explained that Selly used a backing track during the song’s chorus only, which is something many musicians do during television performances, because she wanted it to be as perfect as possible. This means that what we heard during the verses was 100 percent raw vocals from Miss Gomez herself.

You may have noticed that Selena didn’t do much dancing during the gig, but rather focused on moving around between the actual dancers. This was, according to the source, a conscious decision on her part so that she could sing live. As you probably could imagine, it’s way harder to sing when you’re dancing at the same time. TMZ did note, however, that the audio could’ve been messed up so viewers heard something different as they were watching television than what was happening in the arena.

We did see the former Disney Channel star rehearsing in the days leading up to the show, which makes sense if she did really sing. So, the answer to if Selena Gomez was singing live at the AMAs is yes, but also no. Very confusing, we know. Do you think Selena is guilty of lip-syncing “Wolves?” We want to know your opinion, so tell us your thoughts in the comments below! I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr., thanks for watching Clevver and I’ll see you around.

This Fallout VR video lists all the best parts of Fallout 4 VR including the general combat mechanics, the changes to the V.A.T.S system, and the use of the Pip-Boy. After this video it looks like I may be done with Fallout 4 for a while, I will return to Fallout though when I come back to review every single Fallout game, but that is a while away. For now I will focus on VR games within my Absolute Nightmare/This Is Why series.

As a note though many of the complaint I made in my last Fallout 4 VR Is Not An Absolute Nightmare – This Is Why video have been addressed and mostly fixed since the most recent patch for the game.

The most common citrus garnish is the classic citrus twist. While it may take some practice to get looking fantastic, this is still fits into the easy cocktail garnishes mantra. The best citrus twists come off fresh citrus fruit. Older fruit with a drier peel becomes difficult to work with and loses a lot of the appeal that makes twists fun.

Playing with citrus zest can be a rewarding experience. Especially when you get to flame them and make fire! A citrus zest is most often a slice of citrus off your fruit, cut with a sharp knife (leaving little pith on the skin/zest) or a potato peeler.

A fruit flag is a garnish which wraps a cocktail cherry in a slide of citrus, usually an orange slice. Using a garnish pick, stick the sharp end through the left side of an orange slice, then add a Luxardo Maraschino Cherry on the stick. Lastly, poke your sharp pick end through the right side of the orange slice.

Spring and summer time are your chances to excel at herbal garnishes! Garnishing with herbs is simple easy. For a refreshing mojito or tiki drink you'll find a sprig of mint makes a perfect garnish.

The salt rim technique is well established in the margarita market. No doubt you've ordered a margarita at a bar, pub or restaurant and encountered a salt rim. Many establishments will use a margarita salt, which is often a blend of salts and spices. A margarita salt is typically larger / course salt that really pops off the rim and looks impressive.

By far the easiest garnish is the whole garnish, those that you just spear and top.  An olive in a martini on a bamboo garnish pick is a great example. Or, onions in a gibson martini which gives the drinker both a savory onion aroma alongside a treat when the drink is finished.

Echame La Culpa - Lyrics ✍️🎤
[Intro: Demi Lovato & Luis Fonsi]
Hey Fonsi?
Oh no
¿Qué pasa, Demi?
Mmm... hmhm...
Hey, yeah

[Verso: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato]
Tengo en esta historia algo que confesar
Ya entendí muy bien qué fue lo que pasó
Y aunque duela tanto tengo que aceptar
Que tú no eres la mala, que el malo soy yo
No me conociste nunca de verdad
Ya se fue la magia que te enamoró
Y es que no quisiera estar en tu lugar
Porque tu error sólo fue conocerme

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato & Luis Fonsi]
Okay, I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah
I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato & Luis Fonsi]
Okay, I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah
I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato & Dúo]
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (así)
Échame la culpa

[Post-Coro: Dúo]
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometí
Échame la culpa

[Puente: Demi Lovato + Luis Fonsi]

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & (Demi Lovato) & Dúo]

#PlayStation

If you played video games at all in the first half of the 2000’s, then chances are that you’ll have played them on a PlayStation 2. But, despite their ubiquity, there are still some things that you may not have known about the PS2. And, today, we are going to tell you about them.

If you owned a PS2, then there's a good chance that you might have used it to watch a DVD. But did you know that it helped revolutionize that part of home entertainment? We'll tell you about that today, as well as the design feature which made the system really stand out. Not only that, but we’ll tell you how its design helped keep a long forgotten idea, and a company that had seen far better days, in the public consciousness of gamers across the world. You'll also see how the PS2 was able to deliver high-definition graphics, even if there weren't many games that highlighted HD.

If you've ever wondered whether the PS2 could keep track of the games you've played, the answer is yes, it can, and we’ll tell you how you can tell. We will also look at some times when you could use your PlayStation 2 for some pretty dark stuff, including the reason why one particularly unpleasant character bought 4,000 PS2s. Keep watching until the end where we’ll tell you all about how owning a PlayStation 2 means that you have entered the gaming record books.

About MLB.com: Former Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League Club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's Internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the Internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live full length MLB game over the Internet when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com also provides fans with a stable of Club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, that deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.

Major League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels ; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.

Support ScreenPrism on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=7792695

The most prominent philosophical value in Westeros is honor. But we've seen that many characters think being honorable is stupid in this cruel world that requires characters to be cunning and adapt. Ned's honor is answered decisively through his fate. Yet over time Jon and Sansa prove that it's possible to practice versions of Intelligent Honor, and that in the long run certain honorable behaviors can be truly smart.

Mystery Of Love 🎙️🎹Lyrics
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, woah woe is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?

Oh, woah woe is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath

Oh, woah woe is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

But this current state of thinking has created an opportunity for reconsideration. There is hope. It is time to rethink our thinking. It is time for open thinking. Dream. Decide. Do. Repeat.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the surprising history behind sitcom lighting.

Karl Freund was the genius cinematographer behind Metropolis, the silent film classic. But then he designed the set for I Love Lucy - the first of the multicam, laugh-track heavy sitcoms. Today, they look bland, but it wasn’t always that way. But at the time, Freund had a good reason to tackle the challenge.

These lighting techniques are still in use today on sitcoms like Friends, the Big Bang Theory, and other multi-camera hits. What looks generic to our eyes was, at one time, the result of an artist who made the impossible look easy.

Lyrics: 
tell her something
tell her nothing
tell her that you’re
waiting

and I know you like it
so you try to hide it

i was looking
out the window
all the people
waiting

tell her something
tell her nothing
tell her that you’re
fading

and i know you like it
so you try to hide it

and you know I like it
so I dive to find it

In eyes, lost in confusion
Golden hearts, left all illusion
Is it my imagination
Shadow, flicker creation

In, high over the ocean
Waves crash mechanical motion

Left all illusion
Left all illusion",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sRBEc4GP7cY/sddefault.jpg,0.010649847490048079,0.0002565766924966636,41.50746268656717,0.0006337827254954898,0.010906424182544745,0.011540206908040229,2018-03-07,14:50:09,Wednesday,2,4,1,4,1,21,2,4,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,2.0,['WA'],['WA'],True,['WA'],1,1,2,0,1,0,0,2.7021995014037317,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Love Lies Lyrics
[Verse 1: Khalid]
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
My whole lifetime

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen

[Chorus: Khalid & Normani]
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
love lies lyric video

[Verse 2: Normani]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

A little bit over a week ago a friend of mine sent me a vocal demo of a Swedish singer songwriter named ""Hilda"". She'd written a song the day after the passing of Avicii. When I listened to the demo the first time it touched me deeply in so many ways. As artists the best way to express our emotions is through music so I immediately asked if I could make music to accompany the vocal and turn the idea into an actual song. I locked myself up in the studio the next day and was determined to walk out with something magical that would do justice to the sincere message of the vocal and the incredible talent of HILDA. I truly felt this song needed to get heard. So many people are struggling with mental health problems and we have to make sure to never turn a blind eye to this...

All the royalties of this song will be donated to the Swedish charity, Tilia ( http://www.foreningentilia.se ) and other charities devoted to mental health issues. Always remember: we are in this TOGETHER. Love you guys,

Lyrics: 

Never enough
You will always find those days when it’s rough
But you need to feel existent  
Keep it real and be persistent 

No one can win
If you wake up, tryna get out of your skin
You’re the one you have to live with
Slow it down don’t overthink it 

There are people that won’t accept a no from you
There are those who won’t see you as a person, just success
Don’t give in if you feel that it’s not right for you
Don’t ya do it

It’s tough to play the part in somebody’s show 
A no is always no - don’t try to convince me 
It’s hard to face the world 
When words are left unheard  
Wake me when it’s quiet 

On a better day
Just wake me up x3 
Wake me when it’s quiet

Pushing the edge 
Just to give your crowd a smile on their face
There are levels of emotions
Just don’t let it get you over 

There are people that will accept a no from you
There are thousands who’ll see you as a person, not success
Don’t give in if you feel that it’s not right for you
Don’t ya do it

Chorus
It’s tough to play the part in somebody’s show 
A no is always no - don’t try to convince me 
It’s hard to face the world 
When words are left unheard  
Wake me up when it’s quiet 

On a better day
Just wake me up x3 
Wake me when it’s quiet

Chorus
It’s tough to play the part in somebody’s show 
A no is always no - don’t try to convince me 
It’s hard to face the world 
When words are left unheard  
Wake me up when it’s quiet

Well, we’re not sure about you, but when Gina Rodriguez stepped onto the red carpet earlier this evening, our jaws dropped all the way to the floor! Not only were we LOVING her sparkly nude Zuhair Murad (zoo-hare muh-rod) gown with a deep V, but it was complemented perfectly by her slicked back pony tail, and was pretty much everything we wanted from the Jane The Virgin star and more.

Gina wasn’t the only celeb on the carpet that hit us with some shimmer and shine though, because, guys… we’ve got to talk about Lupita Nyong’o! Lupita’s custom black and gold atelier (at-ell-ee-ay) Versace gown was the perfect combination of old Hollywood glamour and total fierceness, which works well considering she recently crushed her role in Marvel’s Black Panther, right?!

But, not too fast! Chadwick Boseman, who plays the starring role in Black Panther, also brought his A-Game to the red carpet, opting for a long back coat with amazing silver embellishments over a traditional tux, and, we’ve gotta say… considering he plays a king in the movie, we really don’t think he could’ve chosen a better outfit. Yes, he looked regal, but he also just took an amazing fashion risk, giving us yet another reason to never stop talking about him!

Chadwick wasn’t the only guy on tonight’s red carpet taking major fashion risks, though. That’s right! In case you couldn’t tell by his Best Actor nomination, Timothée Chalamet (tim-o-thee sha-la-may) had a HUGE year this year, and at tonight’s ceremony, it’s clear that he didn’t only come to win for Best Actor, but for Best Dressed, too! The Call Me By Your Name actor walked out on to the carpet in an all-white tux, complemented by a pair of patent leather boots, ya know… because he’s just THAT cool.

But, do you know who else was looking super cool? None other than Timothée’s co-star Armie Hammer, of course! Armie also took a big fashion risk at tonight’s ceremony, opting for a red velvet tuxedo, and let us be the ones to tell you… it totally paid off! Not only did he stand out from, well, everyone else, but honestly… we don’t think he’s ever looked better!

But, if you weren’t totally here for Armie’s full-on red velvet tux, perhaps you felt differently about Ansel Elgort’s ensemble. Ansel had us completely shook, going with a VERY fashion forward green velvet tuxedo jacket paired with seemingly normal black tuxedo pants, and not gonna lie… this may be our favorite look of his, well, EVER!

And, just like Ansel, other young Hollywood celebs made incredible fashion statements on the carpet, too! Like, Zendaya, for example, who hit Hollywood hard this year with her role in The Greatest Showman. Lucky for us, she hit the red carpet just as hard tonight, stunning us in a draped dark chocolate colored chiffon gown accented with diamond jewelry and a top-knot. So chic!

And, speaking of chic, Emma Stone showed up not in a gown, but in a gorgeous silk Louis Vuitton pantsuit that we’re seriously going to be dreaming about for weeks, and maybe even months! The suit included a red blazer with a bright pink sash and black pants. She also paired it with some diamond drop earrings. Not only did she look extremely glamorous, but wearing a pantsuit to the Oscars? TOTAL power move!

And yes, while some of the younger Hollywood stars totally slayed this year’s carpet, it doesn’t mean some of our OG fave actresses didn’t dress to the nines as well! In fact, Jennifer Garner was arguably the best dressed at the whole ceremony, wearing an eye-catching royal blue pleated chiffon atelier Versace gown that we will never, ever forget. Not only did it fit her perfectly, but it proved that blue is most definitely her color, and she should probably stick with it every chance she gets!

Interestingly enough, Nicole Kidman chose to go with a similar color, showing up to tonight’s carpet wearing an incredible blue strapless gown with a sweetheart neckline and an oversized bow at the waist. Yupp… if Nicole and Jennifer proved anything at this year’s Oscars, it’s that they can still rock a red carpet with the best ‘em… wouldn’t you agree?!

So, anyways, what you guys think about tonight’s Oscar looks?! Did you love ‘em? Did you hate ‘em?

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

The interior's design and finish echoes that of the exterior in terms of unmistakable Lamborghini design, colorways and individuality. Inside, the Urus is as clearly a Lamborghini as it is from outside, with a sporty yet luxurious design and finish.

The Lamborghini Urus embodies the Lamborghini principal that a car's design, power and dynamic capabilities means every driver should feel like a pilot. The Lamborghini Urus is technologically advanced, yet intuitively operable. The driver and passengers are all afforded a low but extremely comfortable super sports car seat position, firmly integrated within the cabin and for the driver, every cockpit control within easy reach. Oriented around the driver, the slim Y design of the dashboard, like double silver wings and connected to the climbing center console, is inspired by the LM002 as well as by current Lamborghini super sports cars. The Lamborghini hexagonal theme echoes throughout the interior, in elements such as air vents and door handles, and even in items such as the cup holders and air bag modules. A multi-function, three-spoke steering wheel incorporates a vibration damper to enhance comfort in all driving conditions. Multifunction switches are intuitively located on the steering wheel to control the Lamborghini Infotainment System (LIS), including car set-up, media, telephone and navigation.
A fully-digital TFT display shows the Urus' main information in an animated 3D representation and is customizable by the driver.

Seating
Its long wheelbase of 3,003 mm and the low seating position of the occupants creates a comfortable and extremely spacious feel. The Lamborghini Urus ensures luxury and roominess for each of its occupants in seats designed specifically for the Urus Super SUV.

The standard front DNA memory sport seats are fully electric, heated and 12-way adjustable. More luxurious, 18-way fully-electric front seats are available as an option, including features such as ventilation and massage. The rear bench seat as standard comes with a movable and folding seat back and ISOFIX fixings. Providing an extremely comfortable five-seat configuration, the ability to fold and move the rear seat offers maximum versatility and increased luggage capacity for daily use. The rear bench seat can be lowered to substantially extend the trunk space from 616 liters to 1.596 liters. As an option in conjunction with the fully-electric front seats, a more exclusive two-seat rear layout can be specified providing exceptional rear passenger comfort while reflecting the Urus' sporty character.

Infotainment System III (LIS) and connectivity
The Lamborghini Urus infotainment system reflects its luxurious and daily usability, and comes with advanced connectivity features. Included as standard is an LIS touchscreen infotainment display across two screens, perfectly integrated within the Urus' interior above the center 'Tamburo'. The upper screen is the key interface for entertainment, managing functions such as media, navigation, telephone and car status information. The lower screen provides a keyboard and hand-writing-compatible screen for inputting information and controlling functions such as climate control and seat heating.

The LIS III integrates innovative connected voice control, able to recognize natural-dialogue voice commands to manage functions such as music, telephone calls or send text messages. Included as standard is a phone holder compartment with wireless charging and voice control; a personal memory profile, USB connections, Bluetooth media streaming, DVD player and a sound system. Other optional features include a TV tuner, DAB and CI card reader, head-up display, a Lamborghini smartphone interface and a smart display for rear seat entertainment. Lamborghini Connect is also offered.

The Lamborghini Smartphone Interface (LSI) allows fully integrated connection of iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) smartphones, supporting the Apple CarPlay TM, Android Auto (90% smartphone market coverage) and Baidu-Carlife (China) as standard.

A sound system featuring eight speakers, driven by four channels comes as standard. A high-end Bang & Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound and 1,700 watt output can be specified, with 21 fully active speakers. Produced through close collaboration between Lamborghini, Fraunhofer IIS, and HARMAN, the system creates an immersive, natural 3D sound experience for all Urus occupants, front and rear.

1) Avengers Infinity War new trailer finally drops

2) Ava DuVernay to direct New Gods for DC Films and Warner Bros.

3) ‘The Grudge’: Demian Bichir, Andrea Riseborough to Star in Horror Reimagining

4) Happy Death Day 2 May Start Filming Soon

5) Taika Waititi Sets ‘Jojo Rabbit’ as Next Feature, Will Play Imaginary Hitler

6) Live Twitter Questions

The long awaited second trailer for Avengers Infinity War finally dropped online this morning, and with it, ticket sales have also gone live signaling that we’re a little over one month from its April 27th, world-wide premiere. Directed by the Russo Brothers, the film stars every single MCU actor ever.

According to Deadline, Ava DuVernay is closing a deal with Warner Bros and DC to direct a big-budget screen adaptation of The New Gods. The movie will be the second $100m plus budget for the acclaimed director, with this new project eyed for starting up a new world of films not connected to the other DC titles, for now.

According to a report from Variety, Demian Bichir has joined Andrea Riseborough in Sony’s reboot of the horror classic The Grudge. Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert will produce for Ghost House Pictures along with Good Universe, who last collaborated on the hit thriller Don’t Breathe.

In a report from Bloody-Disgusting, via an original report from Geek Vibes Nation, a listing for Happy Death Day 2 was spotted in this week’s Production Weekly roundup. They tweeted, “It looks like the sequel to #HappyDeathDay will begin filming May 14 in New Orleans.”

According to The Wrap, Thor Ragnarok director Taika Waititi has cast himself to play Hitler, the imaginary friend to the protagonist of his upcoming new movie entitled Jojo Rabbit. The story is about a 10-year-old boy who is desperate to join the dictator’s ranks during World War II.

SUBSCRIBE TO US -► http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow

If we do our homework well, not only will this be a good way to learn about a country we might know little about, but perhaps bust some myths regarding stereotypes, and give our viewers relevant and useful information about a place they might want to travel to someday. We picked Russia because this is the first example our viewer gave us, and it’s certainly a place that is widely discussed and possibly even mischaracterized. Today we’ll bring you all the latest statistics, see what the media is saying, and look at what Russians are saying on forums, in this episode of the Infographics Show, Is It Safe: To Live in Russia?

I know I said the last FNAF episode was the last FNAF theory, But every time I think I've finished the FNAF theories, Scott releases a new game. It's like he's just sitting around with these finished games waiting for my theory to come out, then bam - he releases the new game. So you can probably expect FNAF 7 sometime next month.

[Intro: Julia Michaels]
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1: Julia Michaels]
Stay right there, get away
I need space, I told you yesterday
Slow the pace down
But then I see your face
Can we do that tomorrow? (Can we do that tomorrow?)
'Cause now you're moving in
On my skin
I move back with my lips
It goes against my better judgement
'Cause I, 'cause I want it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels]
And I'm gonna be cliché here for a minute
And tell you that I've been hurt before (hurt before)
So I think I'm gonna need another minute
To not hurt no more (no more)

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you
Yeah, jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Look at me, being soft
Cut it all, my mind is getting lost
From your touch, I can't afford the cost
Only losing myself to you (losing myself to you)
And I didn't want these feelings, but I brought 'em
But I know that you know exactly when I caught 'em
And I'm trying not to think about it often but, ooh

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you
Yeah, jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
Jump, jump up in his foreign
Used to sleep on couches now the boys really tore
If they sleep on me I tell 'em haters gonna sleep it away, yeah
Fell in love, but it ain't no trust
If it ain't no trust then that girl can't be my love
'posed to put my love above
But instead you gon' sleep it away, yeah
Like a earthquake, yeah I'm dealing with another lil' heartbreak
Man I wish I'd never met you in the first place
And that karma's gonna get you in the worst way
Don't throw your love away
Don't throw your trust away
You always run away
I wish you would fucking stay
But I guess we need another break

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you
Yeah, jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

[Outro: Julia Michaels]
Mmm, yeah
'Cause all I do is ('cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
Jump
Mmm, yeah
'Cause all I do is ('cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)
Mmm, yeah
Jump
('Cause all I do is, 'cause all I do is)

The Mercedes-Benz Metris is a minivan -- just like the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna. But the Metris is a truly terrible minivan. Today I'm reviewing the Mercedes Metris Passenger to show you why the Metris is so bad.

Shure is seeking sonic explorers and recording trailblazers. Musicians know inspiration can strike at any time or place, whether it’s on top of a mountain or in the back of a tour bus. Capturing these moments can be tricky at best, but that’s what makes them so special.

Grammy-nominated US singer-songwriter Tori Kelly will pick the ultimate winner of the final round. The grand prize winners will receive a trip to Los Angeles, California and a professional recording session at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.

This video's audio was recorded using an MOTIV™ MV88 iOS Digital Stereo Condenser Microphone.

Lyrics
Fly me away to town me
Population lacking, as you can see
Just a girl with a bow in her hair
Making her mistakes where no one can care
Cities are pretty but I’m pretty done
With this outside world when I’m not even in one
So watch me go, with empty hands, a refreshed mind and nothing planned

Chorus;
I’m far away and worry free
Friends with the sun and the fish in the sea
Happy in my palm tree pad, it’s the easiest day I’ve ever had
You can’t tell me what to do
Maybe I’m just better off without any of you

Sure it’s lonely on your own -
But I’m so free now that I’m alone
No deadlines no worries no dates
No “hello, I’m sorry but I’m running late”
Tell me are you tempted by the thought of a place
Where you stay for a day without a trace
So watch me go with empty hands, a refreshed mind and nothing planned

(Chorus)

Don’t talk to me today
I’ll be with the waves",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/saHoq_PJEws/sddefault.jpg,0.08037250673982045,0.00024971064335402814,321.86255924170615,0.004543313553725659,0.08062221738317447,0.08516553093690013,2018-02-11,20:44:05,Sunday,6,7,6,7,6,31,49,4,16,0,0,2,0,0,0,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.767955991989787,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 6},6

Now that she's leaving her acting career to focus more on her philanthropy, and will soon be living in Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace with her soon-to-be-hubby, the question remains whether she'll bring her fabulous style to her new home in the UK...

Would those things we loved about Bioware games still be there? If not, would the things Anthem was replacing them with compensate for the absence?

What we’d seen of Anthem until recently had little to reassure us, but the game’s showing at this year’s E3 games convention has taken the edge off our concerns. Here are six reasons that made us stop worrying quite so hard about Anthem. Subscribe for more from Outside Xbox at E3 2018: http://www.tinyurl.com/SubToOxbox

On Saturday, Ryan tweeted a link to an Associated Press report, writing, “A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week … she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year.” After a deluge of ridicule and outrage, Ryan deleted the tweet hours later. For more, we speak with Richard Wolff, emeritus professor of economics at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and visiting professor at The New School. He’s the author of several books, including, most recently, “Capitalism’s Crisis Deepens: Essays on the Global Economic Meltdown.”

Celebrities such as Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) and Sophie Turner (Game Of Thrones) have strongly spoken out on Twitter against Paul and his video, with Aaron Paul (the actor who played Jesse Pinkman), telling Logan to “rot in hell”:

3. Reina Scully’s video.
4. japanese attitudes about death…
about… this “crime”


Our culture triviliazes death and uses it to SELL.
How many youtubers have been told to go kill themselves or be a hero.
The other day there was a swatting incident. The guy took no responsibility.

Reina Scully video

1. Does Logan Paul damage Youtuber’s image?


Should media/TMZ, etc have re-uploaded it.

Does Logan Paul respect the Japanese as people?

Reina Scully looks foreign so she gets treated like a child? I doubt it. It’s probably your size.

Logan Paul is not at fault alone.

It’s YouTube’s responsibility?
As an Ambassador I do not speak for YouTube and get no special upload favors. (Just ocassional swag.) BUT I do know that YouTube puts a lot of the responsibility of flagging videos on US, the community.
There are even something called trusted flaggers.
But it looks like their is currently a waiting list to join:

 YouTube has since responded to the Logan Paul controversy and have said.

This video shows the full Smallville panel at Awesome-Con 2018. The moderator asks Tom and Michael questions about their movies, various TV shows and roles. It was a great panel with these two actors playing off of each other, telling tales from the sets of Smallville, Tom's experiences on Lucifer and in Cheaper by the Dozen, and Michael's podcast, voice roles and movie roles.

The big news is their willingness and discussion of a possible Smallville Animated Series. While there is no official word other than these actors stating their excitement at the prospect, it's possible this may convince producers to seriously consider such a show.

I'm very proud to be the Prime Minister of Israel. A country that says Merry Christmas, first to its Christian citizens, and to our Christian friends around the world!
I'm proud that Israel is a country in which Christians not only survive, but they thrive! Because we believe in this friendship among people. And we protect the rights of everyone to worship in the holy shrines behind me.

So now I have a proposition for all our Christian friends: I'm going to take, next year, on Christmas, for those of you who come to Israel - I'm going to take a guided tour. In fact, I'll be your guide on this guided tour!
And think of all the places you an walk - you can go to the ""Jesus Boat"" in the Sea of Galilee, you can get to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher right behind me. Any places that you want to visit in the footsteps of Jesus, and the origin of our Judeo-Christian heritage.

So please come to Israel, next year in Jerusalem, and merry Christmas to all of you!

. Shadow of the Colossus collectible locations. These are the locations of all fruit, shrines and lizards on the PS4 Remake of Shadow of the Colossus. Fruit and shrines are presented in just a single map I made. You can earn the fruit map during the Hard Playthrough of Time Attack and a Lizard Map in Normal Time Attack. I will show video of each lizard location. Some shrines have multiple lizards

You must pray at all 25 shrines for the Seeking Salvation trophy. This is missable and must be done in a single playthrough. The point of no return is when you jump the gap with Agro on the way to the final colossus.

There are no trophies for finding all of the fruit or lizards however there is one for shooting a lizard with a special arrow (acquired during Time Attack on normal difficulty after you've beaten the game) and for eating one normal and one poison fruit. The poison fruit is on top of the temple in the secret garden and a separate guide has been made for that - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhRsoU3JSp4

Eating a fruit will slightly increase your health and collecting a silver lizard tail will slightly increase your stamina. Normal lizards provide no bonuses.

This guide provides no locations of gold coins.

These characteristics are fundamental in one of their main training drills, the 'rondo.'

In the following video from the training archives, the Barça first team players show their skills with three consecutive 20-touch rondos. Up to 60 passes were made with Luis Suárez and Joan Barbarà, the assistant coach, in the middle.

Check out the reaction from the Uruguayan and his teammates when the three rondos were completed, as well as the punishment they had in store for Suárez!

Lasers are particularly dangerous! Always use extreme caution when operating.  These two lasers are DIODE lasers, which operate at a low end of power and wavelength and are limited in what materials and depths they can work with.

These two lasers were given to me by Gearbest to review.   They can be found here (not affiliate links):

""Jerusalem has been the political, cultural, and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people for thousands of years – they have had no other capital city,"" she continued.
