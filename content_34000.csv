Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby

Our Time To Go Lyrics

Never thought we’d end up here
Now our future seems so clear
I can see the top of the world, down here
Drawing on the window pane
Wanna hear them say my name
All I have are whispers and dreams, down here
Nothing hurts more than saying I’m fine

Not a second to waste
Life won’t wait for you now
This is our time to go
Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts that come at you
Like monsters at night
I don’t wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend
Not a second to waste
Life won’t wait for you now
This is our time to go

When I’ve got it figured out
All alone I get knocked down
Looking at the stars from the floor, down here
Can’t be held up in this place
You can see it in my face
Wishing I could open the door, down here
Nothing hurts more than saying I’m fine

Not a second to waste
Life won’t wait for you now
This is our time to go
Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts that come at you
Like monsters at night
I don’t wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend
Not a second to waste
Life won’t wait for you now
This is our time to go

I’m walking down this road
Nobody’s hand to hold
Way past the point of no return
You strike the match, get burned

Not a second to waste
Life won’t wait for you now
This is our time to go
Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts that come at you
Like monsters at night
I don’t wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend

It sounds like life hasn’t been too great for Adam Hicks after his Disney Channel days – and in case you don’t remember him, Adam once starred in ‘Zeke and Luther’ and ‘Lemonade Mouth.’ Anyway, TMZ and their law enforcement sources reported that Adam was arrested Wednesday afternoon on suspicion of committing multiple armed robberies. 
According to these sources, Adam and his girlfriend reportedly went up to random people in the San Fernando Valley area, stuck a gun in their face and would demand money, cellphones, and whatever else these unsuspecting people had on their bodies at the time. Two of their victims were reportedly elderly women in their 70s. 
Sergeant Derek Green of the Burbank Police Department talked to The Hollywood Reporter about Adam’s arrest and said that Adam was arrested in QUOTE “Connection with a string of armed street robberies that occurred yesterday morning.” It is unclear if Adam’s girlfriend was also taken into custody. On top of being arrested in connection to these street robberies, Adam is also being held on $350,000 bail and is due in court on Friday. 
Unfortunately, Adam wasn’t the only former Disney Channel star who had a recent run in with the law. That’s So Raven star Orlando Brown was arrested earlier this month after cops were called to his apartment due to a pretty loud argument he had with his girlfriend and her mother. 
According to TMZ, Orlando was arrested after the police showed up, but not for the situation that they were called on the scene for. In fact, shortly after law enforcement showed up to the apartment, they ran all three names into their system and an active warrant popped up for both Orlando and his girlfriend’s mom. It was then that Orlando was taken to jail on battery against a spouse, resisting arrest, and possession of a controlled substance. 
Were you surprised to hear this news about Adam AND Orlando? Let me know all your thoughts on this in the comment section below. When you’re done with that, click right over here to find out why Bella Thorne got kicked out of a hotel at Sundance.

Today, we talk about Power Rangers Shattered Grid, the biggest crossover event in Power Rangers history. There was a recent panel at Wondercon where they showed some of what we would be seeing in this event! Shattered Grid is a 2018 crossover story event created by the staff of Boom! Studios and Saban which coincided with both the 25th anniversary of Power Rangers and the commemoration of 25 issues of Boom's comic series, based on a modern take of the Mighty Morphin era. We got the GraveZord, a new Megazord for this series, made up from broken Zords from the Drakkon universe, consisting of Thunder Zords from Season 2.We also gave the Ranger Slayer, who premiered in Go Go Power Rangers Issue 08, which is indeed the Lord Drakkon universe Kimberly Hart, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Pink Ranger, and wields the Bow of Darkness! I hope you enjoy this video!

A pianist, bandleader and composer with a strong foothold in modern jazz, he belongs no less to the terrain of contemporary gospel, alternative hip-hop — and R&B, the category under which he won his first two Grammy awards (of three). Glasper has carved a signature out of this cross-genre dialogue; consult his recent explainer for Jazz Night in America, about the jazz roots of some famous hip-hop samples.

At NPR Music's 10th Anniversary Concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Glasper came to play, bringing longtime associate Derrick Hodge on electric bass and a newer collaborator, Justin Tyson, on drums. The performance began with something like an invocation, as Hodge played a chiming and meditative elaboration on ""Portrait of Tracy,"" a ballad by Jaco Pastorius.

What came next was an unbilled guest: Bilal, the shape-shifting R&B vocalist who has known Glasper since the first day of freshman year at the New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York. They dug into ""All Matter,"" a tune that first appeared on Glasper's 2009 album Double Booked, later resurfacing on Bilal's 2010 release Airtight Revenge. The lyrics establish a philosophical reflection well suited to our times:

We're all the same
And all so very different
Divine by design
It all intertwines

Glasper and Bilal have performed ""All Matter"" countless times, always managing to find some new motivation in the song. This performance features a keyboard solo that starts out terse and gradually opens up and expands, hinting at some tricky rhythmic displacement that Tyson later ratifies, in his spectacular drum solo.

Glasper's solemn but uplifting piano interlude leads into another Bilal original, ""Levels,"" a portrait of relationship strife that refuses to lay the blame fully on either side. It's an argument for rendering complexity with clarity — something Glasper and crew know a thing or two about. -- Nate Chinen

Over half of all animals in the open ocean drift in currents. Jellyfish cross entire oceans feeding on whatever happens to tangle with their tentacles. The jelly-like Portuguese man-of-war can harness sail power to fish with its deadly tentacles.

The big blue is the world's greatest wilderness, far from shore and many kilometres deep. It's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Yet it's home to some of the biggest and most spectacular creatures on earth.

This episode reveals what it takes to survive in this savage and forbidding world. We witness feats of incredible endurance, moments of high drama and extraordinary acts of heart-wrenching self-sacrifice.

Lyrics:

She set my '94 four door Ford on fire today
So I took her favorite pair of diamond earrings and I pawned them away
That's when she walked in the kitchen full of dishes and she broke every plate
She might be the death of me, but I wouldn't have it any other way

She might be my cocaine
She might be my rehab
And I ain't tryna OD
But she’s going to make me relapse, yeah

But if crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two
And I know it’s messed up but I can’t get enough of you
It don’t matter what we say
It don’t matter all the things we do
If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two
If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two

She called my boss and she told him I ain’t coming in to work no more
So I changed every lock on every door before she got home
If I would get a dime every time she wants to go through my phone
She might be the death of me but I know I could never leave her alone

She might be my cocaine
She might be my rehab
And I ain't tryna OD
But she’s going to make me relapse, yeah

If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two
And I know it’s messed up but I can’t get enough of you
Don’t matter what we say
Don’t matter all the things we do
If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two
If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two

She might be my cocaine
She might be my rehab
But I don’t care what anybody’s saying

She’s the pain and my medicine
The problem and my solution
But she knows I wouldn’t have it any other way

If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two
And I know it’s messed up but I can’t get enough of you
It don’t matter what we say
It don’t matter all the things we do
If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two
If crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you

Question from viewer:

Hi Big Herc I'm a viewer from England and I found your channel by chance and I like the real content that you produce.
I have a few non-related questions for you:
1. Have you seen the TV series ""60 Days in"" and if so, in your opinion is that all real, does it show accurately what prison's like or is it all put on for the show?
2. How do inmates react to charity and kindness, do they see it as weakness, do they respect you for doing something selfless like giving your food away, acting like a counsellor to others, trying to be make things positive, treating your homies/friends to commissary gifts and presents during holidays like Christmas, just being a good Samaritan in general?

Official music video for Trophy Eyes' new song “You Can Count On Me” off their new album ‘The American Dream,’ out now on Hopeless Records! 

Directed by Adrian Eyre

Lyrics:

Some of my friends sell drugs,
But I just sell sad songs.
To the ones that feel alone,
You can count on me when it all goes wrong.

Everyone wants to know,
Where it all fell apart.
Pick up my pieces,
And put them back together like art.
I found something I love,
And I let it break my heart.
No, the pain don’t go away,
When the music stops.

Thanks to everyone that bought tickets to my shows.
I put all the money that you spent right up my nose.

Some of my friends sell drugs,
But I just sell sad songs.
To the ones that feel alone,
You can count on me when it all goes wrong.

What do you think I owe you?
Haven’t I given you enough?
Well i can fill a room full of faces I don’t know,
But I can’t see the ones that I love.
I’ve always been so hard on myself,
A piece of me in every song.
I gave them all to you; five years of my life,
And you still think that I've done you wrong.

Some of my friends sell drugs,
But I just sell sad songs.
To the ones that feel alone,
You can count on me when it all goes wrong.

Love me or hate me,
No one’s gonna say you’re wrong.
But there’s nothing you can do or say to me,
That’s gonna break me any more than I’ve already done.
I’ve got a soft spot,
For being fucked up.
I’ve spent years alone and unloved.
But I made it out,
And I’m happy now.
I'm your friend, I'm your brother, I'm your lover, I'm your son.

Some of my friends sell drugs,
But I just sell sad songs.
To the ones that feel alone,
You can count on me when it all goes wrong.

The severe brain injuries left her in a coma for twenty years. Doctors had to remove the part of her brain that governs speech to save her life. The prognosis was that she would be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life, with feeding tubes to keep her alive. In 2005, Sarah miraculously woke up in the nursing home where she lay for two decades and began to speak. She asked the nurse for a manicure.

No-one has ever been in a coma for that long and regained the power of speech. The film meets Sarah two years after she spoke those first words. Now, she wants to prove once more she can achieve the impossible. Sarah’s goal is independence. To feed herself, and be able to stand and walk unassisted. The film follows her rapid progress and her family’s struggle to finance further intensive rehab for her after already losing everything they had on medical bills.

Sarah’s loved ones also come to terms with the guilt, sacrifice, and loss that they suffered over those years that Sarah ‘disappeared’. The film explores how Sarah’s brain rewired itself and how there is much more going on in the brains of coma victims than anyone ever thought possible.

LYRICS

[Chorus]
Hey Matty, Matty
You be looking so fine
And when you walking down the hall
All the girls form a line
They be like 1,2,3
I hope ya pick me, pick me (no pick me!)
Hi Matty
Hey Matty, Matty
You be looking so good
And when you touch down in my city
Come to my neighborhood
Yeah it’s 123 East Peachtree Street
And see me, no see me, see me
Hi Matty

[Verse 1]
Stop, er’body get woke
I’ve been making hits
Since I was six years old
Kicking it in my living room, after school
And just watching cartoons in my underoos, true
With the click of the remote, I can’t believe it
A music video comes on, what am I seeing?
I jump up and I study the beat
I get to shaking my rump, I get to moving my feet
I get to jumping around, break it down
Coming up with my own smooth dance moves
Like I see on TV
Guess it was all she wrote
I hit a couple of notes
We made a video
And online I go
One turned, to two and three
I went upstairs, I said my prayers
I counted sheep, I fell asleep
And when I woke up the next day
Hi, I’m mattyb

[Chorus}
Hey Matty, Matty
You be looking so fine
And when you walking down the hall
All the girls form a line
They be like 1,2,3
I hope ya pick me, pick me (no pick me!)
Hi Matty
Hey Matty, Matty
You be looking so good
And when you touch down in my city
Come to my neighborhood
Yeah it’s 123 East Peachtree Street
And see me, no see me, see me
Hi Matty

[Verse 2]
These days, these boys cuff a lot
Talking all soft cause they think that’s hot, bro
She won’t retweet “mi amor”
When she get a boyfriend that’s 6’4”
Who you talkin ‘bout, MattyB?
Everybody, don’t front y’all do it
Don’t try to hide it
I ain’t tryna date like 10 billion fans
I’m just tryna write a song that can make ya dance, ya know?
I’m too cool for that
My soul is too old school for that
Like a real tight fade from the barber shop
With a brand new Benz in the parking lot
These boys I see, they tryna sleep
The kings here, try not to speak (shhhhh)
Real recognize real, you see
Y’all tripping, I’m mattyb
Now play my theme song

[Chorus]
Hey Matty, Matty
You be looking so fine
And when you walking down the hall
All the girls form a line
They be like 1,2,3
I hope ya pick me, pick me (no pick me!)
Hi Matty
Hey Matty, Matty
You be looking so good
And when you touch down in my city
Come to my neighborhood
Yeah it’s 123 East Peachtree Street
And see me, no see me, see me
Hi Matty

STOP…  everybody dance.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gu1_eWOYlUo/sddefault.jpg,0.005156109750690475,0.0008429538272436509,6.1167166979362095,-1.5815268803820846e-08,0.005999063577934126,0.005999047762665322,2017-12-18,19:57:39,Monday,0,4,71,4,69,22,624,1,178,0,0,2,26,0,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.765640984642259,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

""This is my first year shooting the love advent calendar. I probably watched every video from last year’s calendar just wishing that I could be a part of it and admiring the sexiness of each girl casted. When I got the call to do it this year I screamed. It was so surreal to be shooting it! I told everyone on set to forgive me if I was acting different on set because I really wanted to fully submerge myself into this sex pot character. I requested a bit of tequila so i could get more limber and we killed it. I felt like I was in my very own music video. My 9 year old self always wanted to be Britney Spears and I think that dream has official been fulfilled! Phil Poynter was amazing! He helped me think of what to work out I wanted to portray, what sexy poses to do.. I think he even roared hahaha! I fed off all the energy in the room and Phil’s passion. I’m dying to see it!""

However, very few people know that sometimes this habit does more harm than good. Washing certain foods can spread dangerous bacteria that make their way into your body and wreak havoc on your well-being.
You don’t need to wash store-bought eggs since they’ve already been washed during commercial processing. Plus, manufacturers often put special substances on eggs to protect them from bacterial contamination.
When you wash chicken or meat, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink. Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is. You should also never soak, remove the stalk, or peel them.
You absolutely have to wash fruits and vegetables with both edible and inedible skin. Don't soak fruits and vegetables in water, either. This won't clean them but only spread the bacteria. Use running water, it's a safer bet. Just dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.
Food will definitely get contaminated if you don't wash the can really well before you open it. You should also always wash fresh nuts before eating them, even if they’re peeled.

SUMMARY
-Don't wash store-bought eggs. You will remove the protective layer so if the shell gets cracked, chances are the egg will become infected.
-When you wash chicken, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink.
-Just like chicken, you shouldn't wash raw meat, like beef, pork, veal, or lamb, because it’s also covered in bacteria that the water just spreads all around.
-Washing pasta is pretty much criminal in the culinary world because the water removes the starch that helps the noodles absorb sauce more effectively.
-Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is.
-Rinse fruits and vegetables with edible skin under regular cold running water to remove 99% of the dangerous bacteria. Dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.
-Even if you aren't planning on eating the rind of a lemon or orange, you still need to wash these fruits and also scrub the outside with a clean brush.
-Wash your tin cans with soap before you ever open them to prevent their contents from getting contaminated.
-Washing nuts helps get rid of the phytic acid they contain. Plus, you never know for sure where they’ve been stored, how they were transported, and how many people touched them at the grocery store.
-Even if you bought dried fruit in a nice pretty package, you have to wash it first or soak it for a few hours.

유엔군사령부 군사정전위원회는 22일 “북한 병사가 잠시 군사분계선(MDL)을 넘었다 공동경비구역(JSA) 북쪽으로 되돌아간 것과 북한군이 군사분계선을 넘어 총격을 가한 것은 명백한 정전협정 위반”이라고 밝혔다. 

귀순 당일인 지난 13일 오후 3시15분 지프차를 몰아 귀순하려던 북한군 1명이 차에서 내려 남하하자, 이를 추격하던 북한군 4명중 1명이 MDL을 넘은 것으로 조사됐다. 또 이 북한군이 군사분계선을 넘어 사격한 것도 확인됐다. 

유엔사는 이날 ‘북한군 귀순자가 짚차로 다리를 건너 판문점으로 접근하는 장면’과 ‘북한군이 직접 총격을 가하는 모습’ 등을 담은 폐쇄회로(CC)TV 영상을 공개했다.

유엔사는 북한의 정전협정 위반에 대해 북에 통보와 함께 항의하는 등 추가조치를 취할 예정이다.

국방부도 유엔사 조사 결과를 바탕으로 북한에 공식 항의 통지문을 보내거나 향후 열릴 남북 군사 회담 등을 통해 북한의 사과와 재발방지 약속을 요구할 지 여부를 결정한다는 계획이다.

Could Snapchat actually get cool again? 

Let’s just state the hard cold facts here – all you guys that loved snap a few years ago totally abandoned ship and jumped on the bandwagon when IG stories dropped. But what would you guys say if I told you Snap is back in action and promising that’s it’s way cooler now? Okay that’s actually a lie and definitely not what they’re saying but they are unveiling a major redesign and we’ve got the deets! 

Long story short here, the app doesn’t look a TON different. But outlets are reporting the big chance is the separation of social interaction from media. For example – chats and stories from your real friends will be separated from brands, celebs and influencers. Pretty much anything with a verification is in a totally separate section. 

So for all of you guys out there that are pissed when brands are always at the top of your feed and you can never see your mom’s snap story – this will be your lucky ticket. 

Based on what I’m seeing over on Refinery29 – QUOTE When you swipe from left to right, you'll now see a friend page: This is where all of your chats and Stories from friends will live. New Snaps and chats appear at the top, followed by people and groups you've communicated with recently. Only people that you follow, who also follow you back, will appear here.

There are a few other changes but honestly the main thing to focus on is the fact that you’ll be able to see your friend’s stories easier. Which is cool, but like is it as cool as the Snapchat hotdog of summer 2017? I’m not really sure. And can snapchat ever really be totally cool again? That’s the question and I want you to answer it so hit the comments section and then click here to see the coolest ever wine advent calendar! For the record I never never stopped snapping and I love it – so follow me! Thanks for hanging guys I’m Joslyn Davis and I’ll see you later!

The film focuses on Bruce Wayne aka The Batman, who, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, joins his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to recruit a team of superheroes to face an even greater enemy.

Perri Nemiroff and Jon Schnepp have seen the movie and they were left asking three questions about it. Is Justice League teasing the Wonder Woman 2 story? What does Justice League mean for Darkseid? And should Cyborg get his own standalone movie? Perri and Schnepp explore the possible answers to these questions. Schnepp brings in some of his comic knowledge as a possible roadmap for these answers while Perri examines the hints that the film leaves throughout to possibly answer these questions. Let us know what you think the answers might be to these questions and if you agree with Perri and Schnepp.

Take a look and you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Magnetic Eyelashes seem to be literally everywhere. I was driving down the street in Hollywood a couple days ago and saw a billboard for magnetic eyelashes. Magnetic lashes are a little tricky to apply, but after playing around with them and wearing them the last few months, figuring out the best ways to apply the lashes and talking with the creators on One Two Cosmetics lashes that gave me some extra tips - I present HOW TO APPLY MAGNETIC EYELASHES LIKE A PRO! Proooooo! Proooooooooooooo!

I personally like the BOLD style from One Two Cosmetics the most. They are the easiest for me to put on and they are just the style lash (demi wispie) that I love. It's not a full strip lash, it's just like an ""outter corner"" lash strip!

DISCLAIMER: This video is totally sponsored by One Two Cosmetics, who sent me every pair of lash they make, incuding the lash applicator. However, just organically, naturally, all on my own, without ever knowing who they were, I ordered them and bought a pair of the BOLD lashes myself, along with many other TERRIBLE false lashes, to make a video TESTING & TRYING OUT MAGNETIC lashes. I wanted to test them out to tell you all what I thought...and the others were literally a joke and the only ones I liked were the One Two Cosmetics lashes.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gzQF8mysMUo/sddefault.jpg,0.013558555262089931,0.001162035158216409,11.66793893129771,0.0011287707930002905,0.01472059042030634,0.015849361213306632,2017-12-20,21:00:02,Wednesday,2,5,40,5,25,31,305,0,49,5,0,0,0,2,5,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.913248713875598,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'cell phone': 1, 'person': 1}",2

HOPELESSLY HOPEFUL // LYRICS

Staring eyes wide open gazing into nothing, running in place again
Going through the motions, in and out as the oceans, repeating
Numb to the silence, to the absence of emotion, the sum of the script
Nothing but a click in the rotation
Sick of the peace of mind that goes along with keeping on and I can't keep on keeping on
Inside it feels like I'm stuck here, suspended, at best underwhelming, what's wrong with me?
My conscious is calling but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful
That I'm not stuck here suspended, in a world I pretended was right for me
Strung out on the same old, got an itch for something painful
To feel something real once, to remind myself it’s not in my head
Sick of the calm coinciding with sticking in and with the line, can't keep on keeping on
It all just feels like I'm stuck here, suspended, at best underwhelming, what's wrong with me?
My conscious is calling but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful
That I'm not stuck here suspended, in a world I pretended was right for me
When I close my eyes
When I leave the light
Inside it feels like I'm stuck here, suspended, at best underwhelming, what's wrong with me?
My conscious is calling but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful
That I'm not stuck here suspended, in a world I pretended was right for me

Hi, I'm Yolanda! Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!

Since next Monday is World Nutella Day, I figured what better way to celebrate than by baking the most EPIC Nutella Mega Cake you could ever imagine!? That's right. I'm talkin' about layers of rich Ultimate Chocolate Cake stacked on top of layers of crispy & chewy hazelnut meringues, filled with my special chocolate hazelnut buttercream and drizzled entirely in melted Nutella. YUUUUUM!!

In Civil aviation, there are two main industries for airplane buyers. There is the certified airplane; in which an aircraft goes through different phases, testing and certification process. And there is the experimental airplane; which you buy a kit and build the airplane yourself. I personally have always been fascinated with the idea of building my own flying machine. With an experimental airplane, you have a hand in literally everything that goes into the airplane. You get to pick your own engine, avionics and interior design. That’s freedom on a different level. That said, safety remains the number one factor when it comes to flying and aviation in general. So if you ever decide to go this route, always think of safety first!

In this video I picked out five of the top single engine airplanes that are in the experimental category. Keep in mind that the ranking of these airplanes are based on several factors. Namely: cost, performance, design, comfort and utility. The airplanes listed in this video are:

Lancer evolution - From Lancair. This is one of the fastest kit build airplanes out there. It is also one of the most expensive to build or own. The kit alone starts at over $600,000. A finished airplane will run you anywhere from $1.2 million to $1.5 million. The cost is mostly due to the turbine jet engine that powers this aircraft. We’re talking a lot of horses here. You have three different engine choices of 867HP, 750HP and 550HP. For those who build this airplane, it’s really about speed and how fast they can get to their destination. This airplane will cruise at well over 300 knots, close to 400 miles per hour and it will climb at 4000 feet a minute. Those are performance numbers you typically find in jets.

Glacier III - From Glasair. The Glasair III retractable gear is also one of the fastest single engine airplanes out there. And the Glasair is not only fast, it is also nimble and very sporty. Frankly it takes a lot more pilot skills to fly this bird. This airplane will climb at close to 3000 feet a minute on a normal calm day and it will cruise at close to 300 miles per hour while only burning 13 to 15 gallons of fuel per hour. Talk about fuel efficiency. The Glasair also has a nice roomy cabin for 2. Spacious with more than enough head room for taller people. A complete Glasair III can be bought anywhere from $145,000 - $250,000.

Cubcrafter Xcub - This airplane is built for the absolute nomad or the adventurous pilot. One of the better bush airplanes out there with amazing capabilities and useful load. The Xcub will take off and land in the shortest distance, basically this is an airplane you can fly right out of your backyard; joking. The Xcub model is factory built but you can buy a kit with similar or better performance and build your own airplane. Best thing about the Xcub is the simplicity of flying it. Needless to say that  cubcrafters took their time making the interior space very welcoming. A brand new Xcub sells for $317,000 but you can find older models used for much less.

Sling 4 - From The Airplane factory. The sling is one of my personal favorite experimental airplanes. Not only because it is affordable and light, but because it is very cost efficient. Unlike other 4 seater airplanes in the market, the sling 4 only runs on a small 115 hp turbo charged engine. That power output although small, guarantees you very low fuel burn during your flight. The sling 4 only burns about 6 gallons of fuel per hour while traveling 140 miles per hour. This airplane has 4 seats and yes you can put a person on all four seats and still have a good amount of travel range.


Vans RV-10 - In the experimental world, Vans is arguably the king. It has the most airplanes actively flying in the air and also being built. Last I checked, there are well over 10,000 registered vans RV aircrafts. The RV-10 is an amazing 4 seater airplane with great performance. Performance comparable to the Cirrus SR22, a plane that cost nearly four times the price of an RV-10. Unlike the Cirrus though, one of the best feature of the RV-10 is it’s landing capabilities. It has a shorter take off and landing distance, and you can land in unpaved runways. This airplane will cruise at 200 miles per hour, climb rate is 2000 feet a minute and have a useful load of over 1000 pounds. The All that performance and capabilities for only $200,000? talk about a steal.

In a working-class neighborhood outside Los Angeles, Mike and Peggy raise eight boisterous boys who live out their days with little supervision. The household is turned upside down when oldest son Lawrence returns home and announces he’s quitting the seminary to go off and “save the world.” Times are changing and this family will never be the same. There are 10 people, three bedrooms, one bathroom and everyone in it for themselves. The series is inspired by the childhood of writer/executive producer Tim Doyle.

The series stars Michael Cudlitz as Mike Cleary, Mary McCormack as Peggy Cleary, Sam Straley as Lawrence, Caleb Martin Foote as Eddie, Sawyer Barth as Frank, Christopher Paul Richards as Joey, Jack Gore as Timmy, Andy Walken as William and Santino Barnard as Pat.

From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney's ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" an epic adventure based on Madeleine L'Engle's timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl's transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one's individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one's own light.

The Minnesota Vikings defeat the New Orleans Saints in the Divisional Playoff Round on a last second walk off touchdown pass from quarterback Case Keenum to Stefon Diggs, and a missed tackle by safety Marcus Williams. Drew Brees, Michael Thomas, Melvin Ingram, and Alvin Kamara all had good games for the Saints. Not to Mention punter Thomas Morstead broke his ribs saving a touchdown, and continued to punt through the pain. Their Solid play wasn’t enough to overcome a Minnesota Miracle and great Vikings defensive play throughout the game. 

Everson Griffen was great, safety Andrew Sendejo had an acrobatic interception, before he left the game after sustaining a concussion and getting knocked out cold. That defense kept the game close, setting up the great finish after both teams traded field goals in the last two minutes of regulation. A hell of a finish to the NFL divisional round of the American Football playoffs. 
 
Trailing by 24-23 with 10 seconds left, Keenum dropped back and stepped up into the biggest play of his life, launching a last-second bomb that was caught down the sideline by Stefon Diggs for a 61-yard touchdown reception.

Frozen has joined Disney Theatrical hits Aladdin and The Lion King on Broadway, playing at the historic St. James Theatre. The new Broadway musical opened on Thursday, March 22, and has already set box office records, prompting Variety to declare, “Frozen sizzles!” 
 
“Disney’s struck gold! Sumptuous sets, gorgeous costumes and plenty of special effects to wow the audience!” raves the New York Post. The New Yorker calls Frozen “thrilling” and “genuinely moving” and applauds its “inspired stagecraft;” Newsday writes, “the show has all the makings of a serious megahit” and The Telegraph declares, “Frozen will burn up Broadway for years to come!” 
 
“Frozen's songs shine!” exclaims the Daily News. People writes that the dozen new songs by Oscar®-winning songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez “blend seamlessly with favorites like ‘Love Is an Open Door’ and ‘For the First Time in Forever,’” from “Elsa’s earth-shattering anthem ‘Monster’” to “Anna’s 11 o’clock heartbreaker ‘True Love’” that, as performed by the “bright and beautiful” Patti Murin, “will have you reaching for the tissues.” New York magazine describes Caissie Levy as Elsa “belting her heart out as if she’s Lady Gaga at Madison Square Garden – and the response in the audience is comparable. There are screams, cheers, tears – this is what we came for, and the effect is genuinely electric.”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h71tHtQE3bo/sddefault.jpg,0.011889059852662623,0.000242587169274733,49.009433962264154,0.0007018245148828754,0.012131647021937357,0.012833471536820231,2018-05-11,03:49:25,Friday,4,10,8,10,8,58,78,4,22,1,0,7,8,3,0,5.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.563268323645128,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Q. ""Does this work on painted wood?"" A. Yes! Just be sure the surface is dry and free of oils.

Strap on, it’s a thrilling (bone-chilling) ride.

(Wonder girls) YUBIN - LADY Stage mix

'서둘러줘요 난 바쁜 숙녀라구요'

이렇게 예쁜 유빈을 보고서 그냥 지나쳐 갈 수는 없을 것 같은데
가사가 잘못된 것 같습니다.

※ 표절 논란이 있던 수록곡 '도시애'라는 곡은 발매가 취소되어 앨범에 수록되어 있지않고 '숙녀'와는 아무런 관련이 없는 완전히 다른 곡입니다. 잘못된 루머로 아티스트에게 피해가 가지 않도록 해주세요 :)

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

A motion of no confidence (alternatively vote of no confidence, no-confidence motion, or (unsuccessful) confidence motion) is a statement or vote which states that a person(s) in a position of responsibility (government, managerial, etc.) is no longer deemed fit to hold that position, perhaps because they are inadequate in some respect, are failing to carry out obligations, or are making decisions that other members feel are detrimental. As a parliamentary motion, it demonstrates to the head of state that the elected parliament no longer has confidence in (one or more members of) the appointed government.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hBKhzHTJnNU/sddefault.jpg,0.01365782782419179,0.0004268071195059935,32.0,0.006102433708681438,0.014084634943697785,0.020187068652379226,2018-01-31,15:57:56,Wednesday,2,7,35,7,35,64,333,3,97,0,7,7,26,1,1,8.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.559126805329341,5,"['neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'angry', 'angry']",2,0,0,0,0,0,3,"{'cup': 1, 'tie': 4, 'person': 7}",12

● Description
The Soviet Union, it's neighbours and friends, and Communist Russia has a fascinating computer history which is largely unreported in the West.  I'd like to explore a facet of that history today in the Sinclair ZX Spectrum clones and the impact they had.

I always listen to my body and never restrict. Somedays I eat more, some days less. It really depends on the day, how much exercise I did etc. Overall I try to keep my diet healthy and balanced, but it’s not perfect whatsoever.

Although home healthcare is one of the fastest growing professions in the United States, the workers are some of the lowest paid and least protected in the country. VICE News travels to Georgia, where domestic workers weren’t guaranteed a minimum wage until 2015.

If the GOP’s new tax plan becomes law, there’ll be plenty of big winners—including large corporations and the heirs to wealthy estates. But there’ll also be quite a few losers, and among that group, oddly, will be graduate students.

The London Parliament needs urgent repairs that will cost some 4.5 billion dollars and take at least six years -- and that’s only if lawmakers vote in favor of moving everybody out during the renovation. A debate on the matter is scheduled for December. Meanwhile, the asbestos-ridden, Victorian relic they’re debating the matter IN is falling apart faster than repairs can be made.

What Sugar Does to Your Brain & Body: The Truth About Sugar - Thomas DeLauer


Sugar’s Effect on the Body

1. Inflammation, Joint Pain, and Aged Skin

High sugar foods have been shown to lead to inflammation in the body, which can increase the susceptibility of individuals to these diseases and can also worsen symptoms for those already suffering from them. 

Scientific surveys have also found that increased sugar consumption, in particular sugar filled soda, may increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and may worsen symptoms (RA). 1,2

The inflammation caused by sugar not only impacts our health, but also our skins look and feel. 

When sugars attached to proteins in your bloodstream, advanced glycation end products, or AGEs, are formed. These harmful molecules age your skin through causing damage to the elastin and collagen. This leads to more wrinkles and sagging skin.3

2. Heart Health

When you consume simple sugars, the boost of insulin in the bloodstream can cause artery walls to grow faster than normal and lose their elasticity. 

Over time, this can lead to heart attacks, stroke, and heart disease. 

Additionally, research suggests that consuming less sugar may help to lower blood pressure, which is a major heart disease risk factor. 

Studies have found that those who eat a lot of sugar (25% or more of their calories as added sugar) are twice as likely to die of heart disease when compared to those who consume 10% or less of their total calories from sugar.4 

Sugar’s Effect on the Brain

1. Addiction

Sugar shares many similarities with drugs of abuse. 

In rat studies sugar has been found to lead to signs of dopamine sensitization and opioid dependence, including cross-sensitization with alcohol and amphetamine, neurochemical and behavioral signs of withdrawal, and alterations in dopamine and my-opioid receptors.6 

When you eat sugar, you brain releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter that causes you to feel good.

Whole foods, even fruits, do not cause the release of the same quantity of dopamine as processed, sugary foods, such as donuts. 

As time goes on, your sensitivity to dopamine decreases, causing your brain to need more to feel the same amount of pleasure. 

This is what causes addiction cravings to sugar. 

2. Depression

Studies have linked high sugar consumption to depression risk in adults. 

This leads to the following question: does sugar lead to depression, or does depression influence sugar intake?

Case Study: Sugar Impacts and Adverse Effect on Long-Term Psychological Health 7

In a 2017 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers sought to determine if sugar consumption leads to common mental disorder (CMD) and depression or if the reverse is true, that individuals suffering from CMD and depression are more likely to eat sugary foods. 

Through analysis of repeated measures for 23,245 person-observations from the Whitehall II study, mood was assessed using validated questionnaires and diet through food frequency questionnaires. 

Researchers found that neither depression not CMD predicted the intake changes found during their analysis where positive associations between sugar consumption and CMD and depression were found. 

This led the researchers to conclude that dietary sugar intake has an adverse effect on long-term psychological health, including both CMD and depression. 

So How Much Sugar is too Much? 

Currently the average adult consumes roughly 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day, which is far more than the American Heart Association recommends: no more than 6 t/day for women and 9 t/day for men.5 

Remember that this is added sugar, so not the natural sugars found in fruits,

Mike Pence addressed 500 troops in Bagram on Thursday, four months after President Trump unveiled his strategy for Afghanistan. 

Pakistan has hit back saying 'allies do not put each other on notice’ urging that the focus instead be on creating ‘peace and reconciliation'.

But relations between the two countries have deteriorated, with the US accusing Pakistan of providing safe havens for terrorist groups, a charge Pakistan strongly denies. 

With relations between the two countries hitting a new low, where does it go from here?

Emotions have been high this week along with some wild headaches as we finish up with week 13 of pregnancy.  It's hard to believe there is a baby in there, and can't wait to feel her/him kick or something.  Size and development are rapidly changing and we are excited for what's to come.

A breakdown of this video ( coming soon ) and some products I love so far are below as well as our other weekly videos. Thanks for watching :)

Clocking in at two hours and thirty-five minutes, The Last Jedi is easily the longest of the Star Wars films. But there were still a lot of important scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, with director Rian Johnson promising 20 minutes of deleted scenes when the Blu-ray comes out. So what can fans expect? Here's a spoiler-filled peek at the Last Jedi scenes you didn't see...

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

A long time ago in living rooms across the US, a bizarre 98-minute Star Wars-themed variety show aired on CBS to an estimated 13 million viewers. It wasn't necessarily the first of its kind: hosts like Donny & Marie Osmond and Richard Pryor had done TV variety shows with Star Wars characters in 1977, which had helped boost box office sales. But unlike those shows, the Holiday Special featured the original film's cast. George Lucas was convinced to approve the project in order to maintain interest in the franchise until The Empire Strikes Back's 1980 release — but the special itself is a confusing mess. A crossdressing Harvey Korman leads a cooking show segment, Jefferson Starship stars in a holographic concert, and Chewbacca's dad watches some very suggestive virtual reality entertainment. But if nothing else, the Holiday Special was one of the first examples of Star Wars' expanded universe — whose influence continues to shape the today's Star Wars stories. No spoilers for The Last Jedi, from a certain point of view.

Taking a tour around some of the best showrooms in town, not only is there a Pagani Huayra Roadster to check-out but also not one, not two, but THREE Ferrari Enzos. To wrap things up, I cannot say thank you enough for the epic turnout at the Shmeeting hosted by Lorbek Luxury Cars. So, from the video, what was your favourite car you'd buy of everything we've seen?

Starting off at Dutton Garage, there's plenty to see including an Enzo, Murcielago SV, Aventador SV, SL65 Black Series, 911 R and so much more squeezed into the showroom. Next stop is the Zagame Group showrooms for some special highlights including another Enzo, F50, F12tdf, Speciale A, 599 GTO, Huayra Roadster, GT12, and the brand new Lamborghini Urus.

Finally the big stop of the day at Lorbek Luxury Cars, who I cannot thank enough for hosting our fabulous Shmeeting - easily the largest of all during my Down Under tour. Inside the showroom we can see a silver Enzo, XJ220, and many supercars while having a great time catching up with so many of you who came along.

The departing question though, what was the car you'd buy from the showrooms of Melbourne?

Thanks for watching, Tim

The wildfires in Ventura and Los Angeles counties have so far forced tens of thousands to escape, destroying hundreds of structures and emptying homes, hospitals, schools and multimillion-dollar mansions alike. Some 100,000 acres have burned.

In Ventura, the Thomas Fire burned across 90,000 acres on Wednesday, spreading through an area larger than the city of Detroit. Los Angeles County faced comparatively smaller blazes in the Rye and Creek fires, both of which erupted Tuesday north of downtown Los Angeles.

A closer look at some of the things you may have missed in the new flagship horror film for A24 in 2018. A creepy little and girl, disturbed teenage boy and crazy raging mother make up the cast of director Ari Aster's debut feature film.

In this episode I've found 60 Things You Missed, so I'll be sharing all of the small details, disturbing references and occult mythology hidden throughout the movie.

Did you notice strange words written on the walls such as SATONY, LIFTOACH and ZAZAS? Stick around to the end of this video to learn about their meaning! I'll also be explaining the plot intricacies and mythology behind the mysterious King Paimon. 

I'll also be filling you in on why the film is titled Hereditary, things you missed such as hidden symbols and the meaning behind Annie's miniature creations. We'll be analysing everything the grandmother did to set up the crazy ending to this film and much much more! There's a lot to cover here, so stop reading the description and watch this episode of Things You Missed!

In the middle of all the mayhem and amazing character banter between our favorite heroes, a lot of little details likely passed you by. For instance, did you know that there was an Arrested Development character in the Knowhere scene? Blink and you’ll miss it. Thor’s sidequest involves forging a new hammer to battle Thanos but that weapon’s name ties into another Marvel character from the comics. The post credit scene may be confusing to those who haven’t read the comics or are up to date on current affairs, but a quick little symbol is easily identifiable by those who are familiar with the stories. Vision has a tough time in this movie and he actually sports a second costume briefly that’s taken straight out of the comic book page. Speaking of the comics, Thanos’ final shot is a direct duplicate of the final panels of the Infinity Gauntlet comic run. In that same comic, The Silver Surfer comes crashing to earth to warn Dr. Strange about Thanos. In this version, the filmmakers adapt this scene with their own MCU character. An old villain makes a return in Infinity War, but is voiced by a completely new character this time around. This character also has a nice little reference towards Lady Death, a character hugely important to Thanos in the comics. There’s a bunch of mysteries surrounding the soul gems, but it seems that we got to see the Soulworld in the movie as well which opens up new possibilities in Avengers 4.

Ok so, I got a really really bad concussion. My head is pounding as I type this. It really screwed up my process of animating so apologies for this being late. Also, I FINALLY started using an animation software!! It's toonboom, and because I moved softwares I had to redraw my lip sync frames so that's why they're different.

Cam Rogers (https://twitter.com/mrrogers99) reacts to Tom Brady's short interview with WEEI following Alex Reimer's comments about Brady's daughter. 

Reimer called Brady's daughter ""an annoying little pissant"" in a recent WEEI broadcast when discussing Brady's documentary ""Tom vs. Time.""

Tom Brady said the following on the Kirk & Callahan show: ""I've tried to come on this show for many years and showed you guys a lot of respect,"" Brady said. ""I've always tried to come on and do a good job for you guys. It's very disappointing when you hear that, certainly. My daughter, or any child, certainly doesn't deserve that.""

지난 13일, 판문점 귀순 사건 이후 북한 JSA 경비 병력이 대거 교체된 것으로 전해졌습니다.

귀순자의 탈주를 막지 못한 책임을 물어 지휘관과 간부들도 문책을 피하기 어려울 거란 관측입니다.

강정규 기자입니다.

[기자]
판문각 주변에서 다급히 뛰쳐나오는 북한 군인들,

남쪽으로 달리는 귀순자를 향해 무차별 사격을 가하기 시작합니다.

이 중에 1명은 자신이 군사분계선을 넘은 것도 모른 채 뒤쫓아가다가 황급히 되돌아갑니다.

귀순자는 온몸에 총상을 입으면서도 탈주했고, 2차례의 대수술을 거쳐 건강을 회복하고 있습니다.

북한군이 정전협정까지 어겨가며 귀순을 막아보려 했지만, 결국 실패한 겁니다.

[채드 G 캐롤 / 유엔군사령부 공보실장 : 첫째, 군사분계선 너머로 사격을 하고, 둘째, 실제로 군사분계선을 침범함으로써 북한은 정전협정을 위반했습니다.]

이른바 판문점 귀순 사건 이후, 40명에 달하는 북한군 JSA 경비병력 대부분이 교체된 것으로 전해졌습니다.

탈주를 막지 못한 북한군 지휘관과 고위 간부들도 문책을 피하기 어렵다는 관측입니다.

반면, 주한미군 사령관은 북한 귀순자를 구조하고 큰 충돌 없이 우발 상황을 마무리한 6명의 한미 JSA 장병들을 포상했습니다.

After a little cleaning up they needed to take Bandit to the vet for a quick check up on his cancer. They found that his cancer isn't growing in its original location, but they had the doctor take some samples off a few bumps that Bandit had to see if they were cancerous. After the vet they went toTarget to check out some Valentine's Day items. They found a Taco pillow that smelled like cotton candy and some weird M&M flavors. Then it was back to the house to put together a puzzle Tim found at the Disney Outlet. Join us tomorrow for another new vlog.

Practice Notes 57 | How to Sound Like Bach

In honor of Bach's 333rd birthday, here is ""Happy Birthday"" in the style of J.S. Bach, as well as a few pointers on how to sound like him (at least, on the surface).  Of course, to really get in depth with his music would take 100 lifetimes -- but here is something playful to celebrate with.   The piece starts at 1:55.

**** NOTE- Jenny misspoke on the tutorial. Rather than cutting ALL of the print strips into (6) 4 1/2"" rectangles and (6) 2 1/2"" squares, the directions say to cut 28 print strips into those increments and to cut each of 11 print strips into (16) 2 1/2"" squares. That way there are the correct amount of 2 1/2"" squares for snowballing the corners and for making the blocks.

Jenny demonstrates an easy way to sew a difficult old fashioned block, the card trick.  She used a ""Twilight Tones"" jelly roll by Nancy Rink for Marcus Fabrics.

God of War (commonly referred to as God of War 4 or God of War PS4) is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). It is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. The story is a new direction for the series, as it is loosely based on Norse mythology—all previous games were based on Greek mythology. Series protagonist Kratos returns as the main character, and he now has a son named Atreus. Kratos acts as a mentor and protector to his son, and has to master the rage that has driven him for many years.

I just got a lot of these magnetic balls. Why? I don’t know! That’s why! But they’re cool, and I hope you like this video of me unboxing 10000 5mm buckyballs. I really like these magnets as they’re such a great fidget piece. These are in colours of purple, gold, silver, grey, green, blue and red (my personal favourite is green). I also try to show how ASMR happens with these balls through the clicking, stacking, touching and grinding.

With these magnet balls, you can use them for ASMR purposes create cool sculptures, especially if you have a set of 216 or more. You can see in this video, I show you how to make a cube out of magnets, and then I build a bigger ‘hollow cube’. They’re surprisingly heavy! I figured out a formula to make a hollow cube, it’s 12n-16, where n is the edge size. (e.g. 8 216 cubes make a 2x2x2 cube, 20 216 cubes make a 3x3x3 hollow cube, etc. 

So with 47 sets of magnets, using 44, I can make a hollow cube of 5. Because the cube root of 10000 is 21, I can put a cube together of 21x21x21 magnets! You can make it even bigger if you hollow it out a little, but it’s a solid piece! You can make cool jewellery out of them, shapes, patterns, use them to hang stuff, cable management, anything! The geometry of the magnet balls in the cube is cool enough for me! This video was a continuation of my previous video titled Playing with 1000 mini magnetic balls! (Fun with 1000 cube buckyballs)

Letra:

Recuerdo aquel día como si fuera un hoy
No hay nada como ella, ni siquiera me encontró
Recuerdo todavía la vez que la bese
Fue mi primer amor y ahora escribo su canción

Hay algo mas inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Y trata de disimular que no esta mal
Voy a cuidarte por la noches, voy amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
No hay nadie mas (no hay nadie mas)

Se llevo todo, se llevo tristeza
Ya no existe espacio en la melancolía
Porque a su lado todo tiene mas razón
Me lleve su lagrimas, llegaron risas
Cuando estamos juntos la tierra se paraliza (se paraliza)

Hay algo mas, inexplicable como su mirada inigualable
Como la manera en que me cela y trata de disimular que no esta mal
Voy a cuidarte por la noches, voy amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar

Voy a cuidarte por la noches
Voy amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la soledad
Y aunque existan mil razones para terminar

No hay nadie mas (no hay nadie mas)
No quiero a nadie mas
No hay nadie mas (no hay nadie)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hRtt4jQaoew/sddefault.jpg,0.011093394762962892,0.0003943094941135225,28.133724722765823,0.0001592156404802808,0.011487704257076415,0.011646919897556696,2018-01-27,16:06:17,Saturday,5,8,43,8,29,42,296,3,52,0,0,7,0,1,1,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.941539004751228,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Lyrics:

Chorus: x2

Baby girl

What you doing, where's your man?

I just popped a xan

Fifty thousand in Japan

ain't doin no playin

These red bottoms are no vans

And she telling all her friends

I might put them on the gram


Verse 1:

Baby girl what you doing

What's your name?

I aint playing no games

See these diamonds in my chain

Smoking Mary Jane

Yeah I took her to the brain

And she fucking for the fame

So I fuck her in my Range

Get that money to the top

Never stop

mixing red with wock

Used to sell that boy re rock

But i'm the man

Cuban diamonds dance

Had to fuck her friend

I might put it on the gram


Chorus: x2

Baby girl

What you doing, where's your man?

I just popped a xan

Fifty thousand in Japan

ain't doin no playin

These red bottoms are no vans

And she telling all her friends

I might put them on the gram



Verse 2:

Baby wait, hop up in this wraith

No this not a date

This a cruise, but don't debate

It's getting late think its past eight

Took her to my place

Baby ate me like some cake

Call Jake, think I need a eight

Dopie to the face

Fuck I need to take a break

But dont be cool

Money stupid blue

Boyfriend is a fool

I'm trying to make you comfortable",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hTLrY2tJkcc/sddefault.jpg,0.009821941231365507,0.0003252865273207149,30.194737274444837,0.00035031473415435055,0.010147227758686223,0.010497542492840574,2018-03-16,13:17:03,Friday,4,9,84,9,64,56,546,6,97,0,0,7,15,0,8,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.992044243217891,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

On October 25, 2017, astronomers from NASA’s Minor Planet Center sent out an announcement that they needed help confirming the trajectory of an interesting object.

Known as C/2017 U1 PANSTARRS, the object was moving quickly through the Solar System, on a path that would take it out into deep space.

Astronomers were happy to oblige, providing dozens of observations within a few days, confirming that yes indeed, we were looking at the first asteroid that had come from interstellar space.

It turns out that C/2017 U1 PANSTARRS, later given the Hawaiian name Oumuamua, or “a messenger from afar arriving first”, had already made its closest pass to the Sun on September 9th, 2017, traveling at a top speed of 87.4 kilometers per second.

It whipped around the Sun, and then continued on its hyperbolic orbit out into deep space again. It passed near the Earth on October 14, then crossed the orbit of Mars on November 1st, by May 2018 it’ll be farther than Jupiter, and get past Saturn in early 2019.

Astronomers around the world have been making continuous observations of the asteroid, using some of the largest telescopes on Earth and in space. But they’ve got to work quickly, by mid-December, it’ll be too dim to observe with any of our instruments.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hUTGijsCCyk/sddefault.jpg,0.02463622974963181,0.0005655375552282767,43.5625,0.006798232695139911,0.02520176730486009,0.032,2017-12-12,20:11:49,Tuesday,1,10,32,10,30,66,305,3,54,0,2,10,2,4,1,6.0,9.0,"['Interstellar Interloper', '', 'Sse', '', 'Aira) :', 'Fraser Cain']","['Interstellar', 'Interloper', 'Sse', 'Aira)', ':', 'Fraser', 'Cain']",True,"['interstellar', 'interlop', 'sse', 'aira', ')', ':', 'fraser', 'cain']",8,8,39,2,0,0,0,5.93921763944535,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Back in 2017 Netflix dropped 13 reasons why, a fictional show about the suicide of a highschool student named Hannah Baker who left behind 13 tapes, each holding a reason for why she ended her life. The show produced by selena gomes received rave reviews, went viral, and also sparked some controversy over the dark subject matter. And now that the Season 2 trailer has dropped, it’s easy to see that more controversy is on the way.

Brian Yorkey is the showrunner of 13 Reasons, and in an interview with EW, he stated “the biggest difference is in season 1, Hannah was telling us her story, we were experiencing it with Clay, and it was the central monolithic story of the season -- her story, where it ended, and how that fell out in the present day,”. He continued on to say QUOTE “Season 2 is very much more about everyone else’s perspective on that story -- their side of the story, their reaction to it, their coming to terms or refusing to come to terms with their role in Hannah’s life and death.”

Wow it really sounds like we season 2 is going to continue to pull at dark strings behind this small town. In the trailer we also see that clay has been pushed so far to the point where he has a gone. Clay is continuing to have visions of Hannah, meanwhile Jessica is being pressured into not saying anything about her sexual assault. And bryce is actually getting called out for being a rapist…  Things are more than tense.

In an interview with Buzzfeed, the actress who plays hannah baker katherine langford opened up about how she hopes her show will help spark even more discussion around sexual assault. When 13 Reasons first aired, non of the #metoo movement even existed. Katherine told buzzfeed “What’s so special about being able to put them in a TV show is it brings the issues to light [...] It gets people talking about things that have existed for a long time, but may be taboo to talk about or aren’t spoken about as much as they should be.” Katherine also mentioned that sexual assault survivors had come up to her after season 1 to thank her for her honest portrayal of sexual assault.

Okay, i know that was a lot of info, but it just proves how crazy season 2 is going to be. So please please please tell me what you think about all of this new info! Leave a comment down below and don’t forget, 13 Reasons Why Season 2 starts streaming this month on the 18th!!

These survival hacks are important for all of us, even if you don't live in an area with a lot of seismic activity. No one is 100% safe from this disaster because you never know where you might be traveling or living in the future. So pay close attention to these safety recommendations that could save your life one day.
Fortifying your house is a good place to start. Make sure you have enough supplies, including food, medications, fire extinguishers, batteries, and flashlights. Have an expert test your house’s foundation so it won’t slip during an earthquake.
Depending on where the earthquake finds you, you should follow different survival rules. The most important thing in all cases is not to panic and to memorize the Drop, Cover, and Hold on technique. Drop right where you are onto your hands and knees. This is a safe position that allows you to slowly move towards shelter. Use one arm to cover your head and neck. A massive desk or table makes a good shelter. If there’s nothing in the room to hide under, at least stay away from the windows. Remain in this position and bend over as much as you can to protect your vital organs. Hold on like this until the shaking stops. If you were able to find some shelter, hold onto it using one hand and be prepared to move with it as it might shift.

SUMMARY
-Be prepared for disaster: move all beds away from windows, strengthen shelves, cover all glass surfaces, keep extra fire extinguishers, batteries, flashlights, emergency food supplies and medications in your home. 
-Drop right where you are onto your hands and knees, use one arm to cover your head and neck. Hold on like this until the shaking stops.
-Move away from power lines, tall buildings, and roads, try to find some shelter, drop, cover, and hold on. 
-Slow down and find a safe place to stop the car, stay in it until the earthquake stops.
-Collect your things immediately and move to higher ground to avoid tsunami. 
-Lock your wheels, cover, and hold on. 
-Get on the floor in the space in front of your seat, bend over and cover your head and neck with your hands. Stay calm and reassure others.
-Lie down on the floor, cover your head, wait until the elevator starts working again and get out of it ASAP. 
-Stay in bed, protect your head with a pillow and lie face down, move away from shelves. 
-Don’t move, cover your mouth with a cloth or piece of clothing. If you have a whistle, use it so that rescuers can find you.
-Close all windows and shut off the gas, water, and electricity in your home. After leaving the building with only the most necessary things with you, find a safe place. Whatever happens, don’t panic.

'Cause I don’t know what to say to you
Fill my head with shame ‘cause you need someone to blame
I’m just an object of disdain to you
I’m only 17, I don’t know what you mean
Bite my tongue now that’s your cue, to bring me down
Redirect your gaze ‘cause that’s your middle name
All the same
Kill me now
I’m such a drama queen you’ve got something up your sleeve don’t you

Oh wait a minute

Hot Pink
Is it mine? Is it
Is it mine? Is it
Hot Pink
On my pony in the sky I just want
Anything and everything just paint it all in hot pink

Say to you
Been thinking over things I’ve never said before
'Cause there’s an element of great with you
What a waste on you
Been looking out for me and then you bring it right back
So call me up and hear me out
You keep thinking about it
You know that’s not enough
Well keep thinking about it
I just let it go at first but you went and made it worse
And a glitter eater doesn’t need it best believe it even if I’m feeling don’t you

You wouldn’t believe the lengths I’ve gone for you
You wouldn’t believe the shit that I can do
Is it cool is it mine?
And why you trying to design, to decide
If it’s a girl or it’s a guy
Well there’s no reason to define

Hello is that you?

Our trekking team has now raised over £220,000 for CoppaFeel. I can’t tell you how much that means to the charity and how far that money will go to ensure cancer is detected as early as possible. We all know that doing so will save lives. 

Being in Oman and trekking (we should be referring to it as mountain climbing) with the most incredible bunch of people was the most awe-inspiring thing I’ve ever done. Every single person was there for a different reason. Whether it was to prove to themselves that they could do it, to mark a special Birthday or to honour a loved one sadly lost. 

One woman stole my heart from day one. This time last year she was undergoing her last round of chemotherapy. To see her determination, focus and strength as she conquered those mountains was something of utter brilliance. I’m sure her children are immensely proud of her! 

Crossing that finish line with my team is a moment I’ll never forget. The tears ran freely, the sense of achievement was sky high and the love was palpable. My dear Goats, to everyone on Mario’s team, and to every single person who was a part of the wider crew - you will forever have a place in my heart! ❤️ If you would still like to sponsor (I will be giving away some signed books to some lucky winners when I’m back from tour) then please do!

This includes producer TM88 who tweeted that he was never paid for Lil Uzi Vert’s hit single, “XO TOUR Llif3.”

According to an entertainment lawyer we interviewed, a major form of income for producers often comes from royalty advances, however, that’s not always plausible because mixtapes don’t usually have the same budgets as albums. Navigating producer deals and rates can seem overwhelmingly complex, but there are guidelines to follow. Check out the video above to learn how producers can protect their paychecks.

A place where stars can vent, grow, and unite over the concept that sometimes parents just don’t understand.

John Boyega, Gwendoline Chrisite, Mark Hamill, and Kelly Marie Tran stopped by to answer your questions (and posit some of their own) about “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and it was blast right from the get-go. Topics discussed include a Captain Phasma/Brienne of Tarth team-up, J.J. Abrams’ birth name (Jar-Jar, obviously), and one of the most famous lines in cinema history.

“Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” directed by Rian Johnson and starring Mark Hamill, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o opens in theaters everywhere Friday, December 15th.

The Des Moines Register reports that 17-year-old Avery Arneson and 13-year-old Aiden Arneson, sisters from Decorah, died a two-vehicle crash around 8:30 a.m. Monday on a county road in northeast Iowa. Four other teens were injured and hospitalized in that crash.

In Cedar Rapids, two men died in a crash on Interstate 380. Killed were 24-year-old Jacolby Jesse Burks, of Cedar Rapids, and 21-year-old Devion Martel Luster, of Dixon, Illinois.

One person died and several people were critically injured in the pileup that closed Interstate 35 near Ames.

On I-80, police say a person was killed in a crash east of Grinnell around 1:20 p.m., and another person died and two others were injured at 1:40 p.m. near Durant.

Support John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea

3:35 PATREON Supporter Brad Stowell - Hi John! CW’s 2 night crossover event “Crisis on Earth-X” has come and gone and I absolutely loved it! Thought it was so much better than last years. The villains were much better than those awful cgi Dominators and it was great seeing wells back in that yellow suit. It felt like a 4 hour superhero movie! What are your thoughts?

8:15 David Rainey - Hey John! Longtime fan. Loving the new content. I was reading a Forbes article on Disney attracting wall street attention and buried in the article is a statement that their upcoming streaming service will be priced ""substantially"" below Netflix. What are you thoughts?

11:01 Edgar Magana - Hey John love the show! I was wondering what was going on with the Scarface remake? Last i heard they booted David Ayer for making the script too dark. Would love to hear your thoughts!

13:40 Connor Griffiths - Hi John, Connor from the UK here! I watch your shows every day so keep up the great work. Now to my question: in an interview with Rolling Stone Daisy Ridley said she would not reprise the role of Rey after Episode IX. Should we now assume that Rey is destined to die in this trilogy or do you think Disney will leave her story open ended? If you have other ideas what are your thoughts? Thanks!

21:20 Keith Thomas -  I know you're always trying to see the positive side of WB, and you often say ""They're not stupid. These are smart people."" But, this article from The Wrap proposes that they are, still, just people.  And the ultimate failing of Justice League is a combination of indifference, incompetence, and good old fashioned self-interest.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcUgeotXH-I/hqdefault.jpg,0.032134429531210075,0.0017284655734748169,18.591304347826085,0.008927900440382969,0.0338628951046849,0.042790795545067865,2017-11-30,20:52:28,Thursday,3,15,31,14,31,85,230,1,55,2,5,12,26,3,2,5.0,6.0,"['D', 'U', 'D', 'i', '', 'OT Tae }', 'WT STs', 'CEU 6', '', ""ERSONAL' GAIN?"", '', '3', '', 'DAISY RIDLEY,', 'es i', '', 'TNS', 'Oa ate) a']","['D', 'U', 'D', 'i', 'OT', 'Tae', '}', 'WT', 'STs', 'CEU', '6', ""ERSONAL'"", 'GAIN?', '3', 'DAISY', 'RIDLEY,', 'es', 'i', 'TNS', 'Oa', 'ate)', 'a']",True,"['D', 'U', 'D', 'i', 'OT', 'tae', '}', 'WT', 'st', 'ceu', '6', 'erson', ""'"", 'gain', '?', '3', 'daisi', 'ridley', ',', 'es', 'i', 'tn', 'Oa', 'ate', ')', 'a']",26,24,54,5,5,4,5,6.334677000882003,3,"['happy', 'happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,2,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Manhunt is a stealth-based survival horror video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was originally released for the PlayStation 2 on November 18, 2003, and for Microsoft Windows and Xbox on April 20, 2004. The game was also re-released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Players control James Earl Cash (voiced by Stephen Wilfong), a death row prisoner forced to participate in a series of snuff films for an underground director, former film producer Lionel Starkweather (Brian Cox).

The game received positive reviews by critics, with particular praise directed at its dark tone and violent nature. The game also received great controversy, due to the level of graphic violence in it. It was banned in several countries, and implicated in a murder by the UK media, although this implication was later rejected by the police and courts. The game won several accolades, and spawned the sequel Manhunt 2 in 2007. As of March 2008, the series has collectively sold 1.7 million copies.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hdx9UcTNkaM/sddefault.jpg,0.02135454458775257,0.00045734343259678953,46.69257950530035,0.003298367300106175,0.02181188802034936,0.02511025532045553,2018-04-07,17:13:28,Saturday,5,8,53,8,42,61,401,4,76,0,0,6,0,1,0,7.0,7.0,['erro 2'],"['erro', '2']",True,"['erro', '2']",2,2,5,0,0,0,0,6.0888339187432425,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Fans of Cardi B the world over were delighted when they first discovered that she's got a sister, who's equally funny, charming and talented. I'm talking of course about the beautiful, Hennessy Carolina.

Cardi's stardom has obviously been a major factor in Hennessy's rise to fame, and Hennessy shows her appreciation, frequently shouting out her sister's various projects on social media.

I bring all the tea and jokes through lighthearted commentary and short video clips about many Daytime TV shows. The shows that I discuss are The Real, The Wendy Williams Show, TMZ Live, The Steve Harvey Show, Ellen, The View, and more. I discuss hot topics from these shows while also adding my own sense of humor about the topics and the hosts of the shows. These are some of my favorite shows and I am a fan! My intent is not to offend anyone, these videos are for entertainment purposes only. Hope you enjoy!

**Not all my animals are featured in this video, so if you notice one missing don't worry they're chillin off camera and will be around in part 2.  Part two is not coming immediately after this video, it'll be a few weeks. Don't worry I have many other videos coming in the meantime!!!

Sorry the captions go away super quick during the animal build :( It didn't look like that while I was editing and I didn't notice until after I already began uploading and I'm too excited to get this up to go back into editing and fix it. :\\\

Doug Jones became the first Democrat in 25 years to win a Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama.

Some Republicans are saying this is no big deal - it’s just one state - but this is actually the third election Democrats have won unexpectedly, first in the New Jersey, then Virginia and now in perhaps the most conservative state, Alabama.

Democrats now believe they have a good chance of taking back the House and Senate in 2018 – and with all the talk of impeachment – that could spell big trouble for President Donald Trump.

""We have all suffered in this war, we are all touched by it"". In a country that has been at war since the 1990's, it is unsurprising that anger and resentment are widespread. Bilal leads the club, made up of Sunnis, Shias and Christians, and is determined to use it as a force for good. He ""wants to look forwards not backwards- for an Iraq free of terror"". But tensions in refugee camps still continue to simmer. With IS sympathisers and those who have been victimised by IS forced to live alongside each other, it is clear that Iraq is far from united. Whilst Iraq waits to see if the war against IS is genuinely finished, the Iraq Bikers continue to foster peace across their country.

Full HD Documentary 
Watch: The White Lions https://youtu.be/hiTHB2RtC3c
Once a mountain kingdom of ancient palaces and emperors, Korea in the 21st century is largely known for its modern cities and decades of conflict. Tensions between North and South may be what defines it to outsiders but beyond the battle scars, there is another side to Korea. In the south are large pockets of untouched wilderness where extraordinary animals flourish and Koreans continue to practice age-old traditions in tandem with the seasons and with nature. It is in these connections, rather than in division, that we see the true Korea.

At the southernmost tip of the peninsular, we follow a pod of bottlenose dolphins through the volcanic islands of Jeju. They click at each other as they encounter a human in their midst, but the dolphins know this diver well - they have shared the ocean with the Haenyeo, or sea women, for thousands of years. We travel onwards to the isolated island of Marado, where three generations of sea women are preparing for a dive. Today is the start of the conch season, and they work hard whatever the weather to maximize their catch.

On the grounds of an ancient palace on the mainland, a raccoon dog family takes advantage of a rare event. Just once every five years, hundreds of cicadas emerge from below ground providing an easy feast for the raccoon dogs who voraciously fill their bellies. Those that escape their jaws make for the safety of the trees, where they metamorphosis into their flying form.

On the mudflats of Suncheon Bay we find a habitat that is neither land nor sea. Only recently has the ecological value of mudflats been recognized. A staggering 50 percent of the earth's oxygen is produced by phytoplankton - microscopic algae that are found here in great abundance. That is why the mudflats are known locally as the lungs of the earth. Plankton is far from the only life here - the mud of the bay is rich in nutrients and supports one of the most diverse ecosystems on the peninsula. We follow the story of a young mudskipper who has emerged for his first mating season. His journey to find love is paved with obstacles.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hjujTTRB01E/sddefault.jpg,0.008980841717851677,0.00030147851499813267,29.789325842696627,0.0007498854635697935,0.009282320232849807,0.010032205696419605,2018-02-18,23:03:07,Sunday,6,10,53,10,36,55,406,3,72,1,2,5,8,2,3,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.622765754747214,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

The mains are freeze dried and other components switched out for lighter ones reducing the weight to 2 1/2 lbs. And with minimal reduction in caloric content. Amazingly fresh food, yet seriously lacking closure devices to those main's pouches. No gusset, no problem.

Several thousand homes are under mandatory evacuation in the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula, some 70 miles (115 km) north of Los Angeles.
Firefighters warned the fire was moving so fast they were unable to contain it.
Fanned by high winds, the fire swept through 31,000 acres (12,500 hectares) in a matter of hours.
One person died in a traffic accident while trying to flee the blaze - which has been named the Thomas Fire - and one firefighter was injured, officials say.

Creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with 9-1-1, exploring the high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The provocative series stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Love Hewitt (“The Client List,” “Ghost Whisperer”). Additionally, Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Rockmond Dunbar and Ryan Guzman (“Notorious,” “Heroes Reborn”) are featured in series regular roles.

WHAT IF LYRICS:

Let's talk about all the things that we shouldn't talk about
Those kind of words that will change all the things we talk about
Tell me do you ever think of us?
Should I ask for more or should I stop?

What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to lose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing the writing on the wall?

What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?

I hear everything they saying, saying 'bout us
It's not about right or wrong, it's about what we love
Would it be simple or would it be too complicated?
Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop?

What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to loose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing all the writing on the wall?

What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?

Let's talk about all the things we shouldn't talk about...

Siri is just stupid, there's very limited features and you're stuck using Apple Music. 

In this video I even do a Homepod vs Amazon Echo Vs Google Home so you can see the good the bad and the ugly. Simply put Apple HomePod isn't ready for prime time and you're better off getting a Sonos system instead.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hohuK2eXzdo/sddefault.jpg,0.010351791878714543,0.000152733786492995,67.77669902912622,0.0003099161298741355,0.01050452566520754,0.010814441795081677,2018-04-11,08:35:00,Wednesday,2,11,39,11,34,53,344,1,79,0,1,8,18,3,0,4.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4545257607401085,2,"['happy', 'neutral']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hqYqdgHIRY4/sddefault.jpg,0.009203757528594763,0.00018647784589399086,49.35576923076921,0.0003030264995777353,0.009390235374488754,0.009693261874066493,2018-06-13,08:35:00,Wednesday,2,9,40,9,35,61,351,6,79,0,1,7,19,0,0,6.0,8.0,"['a', 'EU 7g', 'rt mi']","['a', 'EU', '7g', 'rt', 'mi']",True,"['a', 'EU', '7g', 'rt', 'mi']",5,5,9,0,1,0,1,6.4719151949818245,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 2},2

Officials from the two sides met for 11 hours and eventually agreed Seoul would lift sanctions temporarily, so North Korean athletes could visit the South for next month's Winter Olympics. 

This represents the biggest thaw in relations for years, but Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions were off the negotiating table.

A youtube mash up for this Sunday! Going through recent makeup favourites, whilst I show you how I create my everyday makeup routine. It's been so long since I filmed a favourites video, or an everyday makeup routine, so I thought they would work well together today! I hope you like seeing some old favourites I've rediscovered and some brand new additions too - just a quick note to also say nothing in this video is sponsored :)

From Emmy Award-winning executive producer and creator Seth MacFarlane (FAMILY GUY, “Ted,” “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey”), THE ORVILLE is a live-action, one-hour space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life. The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”). The Orville has been renewed for a second season.

The Famous ""Crying Indian"" Who Wasn't
https://youtu.be/mErdqTpl-mQ?list=PLR0XuDegDqP33-NUx7wuKb-3PDj-gRKgR

In this video:

On January 20, 1961, the newly-elected President John F. Kennedy,  at his inauguration in front of the Capital, told Americans to “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” Over 800 miles away, in Jefferson, Wisconsin in an institution called “St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children” lived a 43 year old woman, who perhaps was listening to the address on the radio. Her name was Rosemary Kennedy and she was President Kennedy’s little sister.

【STORY】
こいつら、いったいどこまでデカくなるのか！？
地上最強の巨獣たちが、すべてを破壊しながら北米大陸を横断！！

それは人類の誰も気づかぬうちに始まった。
最新を誇る遺伝子実験の失敗によって、なんと普通の動物たちが突如進化し始める！
ゴリラ、オオカミ、ワニなどが猛烈に巨大化し、凶暴化してしまう。
ヤツらの成長はとどまることを知らず、もはやクソデカい巨獣と化し、陸・海・空おかまいなしに街で破壊の限りを尽くす大乱闘をおっぱじめる！
シカゴを舞台に、巨獣たちの暴れる理由は一体なんなのか？
生物ピラミッドが一夜にしてひっくり返った人間たちに、巨獣たちの大乱闘を止めることができるのか？

ハイブリッドな成長をうながす巨獣の遺伝子は、発狂しそうなほど滋養満点。
サメの成長が止まらない遺伝子だけでなく、シロナガスクジラの成長率、カブトムシの強靭さ、チーターのスピード、トゲマウスの細胞修復能力など、ありとあらゆる異なる遺伝子を混ぜ合わせた予測不能の特殊生物たちだ。
ワニの黒いウロコはチタンより硬く、足の指は車の大きさを超え、尻尾の先がスパイクボールのように変異し、ドラゴンと恐竜が合体したような姿に。
ヤツらは時にタッグを組み、戦闘機や戦車に真っ向から向かってくるから、こりゃたまらん！！
もちろん巨獣同士のバトルも満載！！
最弱となった人類側の代表は、あの「ロック様」ことドウェイン・ジョンソン（元WWE世界王者８度制覇の最強プロレスラー）演じる霊長類学者デイビス。この勝てる気がしない戦いにどう挑むのか？
『パシフィック・リム』『キングコング：髑髏島の巨神』に続く巨大怪獣パニック・アクション襲来！！　
人類に一寸の希望も与えないヤツらの大乱闘を、止める術はあるのか？
もはや無駄な抵抗はやめて観るしかない！！

How To Get Respect Without Being A Bully - Jordan Peterson
https://goo.gl/DLouoh

Jordan Peterson recently expertly handled a debate during an interview with BBC's Channel 4 news (The video was called: Jordan Peterson debate on the gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism).   And JBP did it without being a bull or being aggressive.  So how do we get respect without being a bully? Well, we often think that getting respect and being aggressive go hand in hand.  Because unfortunately, it’s often the bully that gets the most respect in the schoolyard and even in the workplace. But Jordan Peterson is an exemplar of a different way to generate massive amount of respect.  So in this video we’re going to explore 3 main things he does that force people to respect you WITHOUT being a bully.
 
Now, we focused a lot on respect in this video but that's actually just one out of four emotions that are going to create an amazing first impression on anyone cross-culturally. Now, if you're curious with the other three emotions that you want to create in that person are to make an amazing first impression, I made a video on that that breaks down what those four emotions are so that you can start using them today to consistently make killer first impressions. 

0:30 Jordan Peterson calls it ""pacing your reality""
4:50 Jordan Peterson tells stories effectively
6:54 Jordan Peterson uses archetypal stories

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

FAQs:

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.

Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?
A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hu3tAjLaBWw/sddefault.jpg,0.0325531702196786,0.00036738060130457595,88.60884353741497,0.0005110838977332367,0.032920550820983184,0.033431634718716415,2018-04-04,16:17:47,Wednesday,2,8,69,8,56,38,575,3,140,2,0,3,10,1,3,4.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.349931554663673,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Shot at Maletsunyane Falls in Lesotho, this video only came about because we had heaps of help. Firstly thanks to Duane Orriss (DuaneOrriss.com) and Ryan Lucas (Goyastudio.com.au) for coming along as videographers, you guys are both legends! Secondly thanks to Semonkong Lodge for housing and feeding us each day, we had a great experience and definitely recommend everyone stays there when visiting Lesotho. Thirdly thanks to all the local crew who helped find and walk up basketballs, operate the pulley and sort out our harnesses, we really couldn’t have pulled this off without you guys. And finally, thanks to Spalding for providing the basketball gear and Kathmandu for all the epic outdoor gear!

This is genuinely our favourite video we've ever made and we hope you enjoy watching it as much as we did! We've laughed so much at so many moments even though we've seen it a heap of times. We always wanted to make an extended version of our short 2 min world record video (that we released in January) but it's taken us a while to finally get there. It's certainly been worth the wait. If you like the video make sure you give it a thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed hopefully this video gives you enough reason to hit that button! Cheers and thanks again for tuning in - Brett, Scott & Derek

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

Movie 43 is one of the worst films I have ever seen – no not as bad as Manos, but made by actual filmmakers, and a lot of them, all of who should have known better, all of who do know better.

What is it like to be an Asian man in Japan? How's your experience will be different from non-Asian foreigners?

-- About some Filipinos in Japan --

As Kenji said, it used to be easy for Filipinos to get certain kinds of visa in Japan. A lot of young girls from improvised areas came to Japan to work for hostess clubs during that period. What made the situation complicated was the existence of 'brokers' in both countries whose practise may have been quite questionable. Because of all those factors, Japanese people (especially men) from certain background and of certain generation may have very biased views of the Philippines.
But there flip side of this story is that Filipina women are quite popular among Japanese men. Filipina-Japanese marriage is the second most popular international marriage in Japan.

An instant classic, ""Call Me By Your Name"" and its actors are nominated at the 2017 Gotham Awards for Best Feature, Best Screenplay and Breakthrough Actor, and bolsters Guadagnino’s rightful reputation as one of the most inspiring filmmakers working today.

We got some amazing art this week from a fan who's great at metalwork, along with some of his favorite cereal. James found the pieces so inspiring that he decided to create some fine art of his own. You'll witness his foray into street art right here, along with Aleks'  customary parkour warmup routine.

The Alola Islands have a BIG Problem, and it’s name is Yungoos. Humans on Alola imported the Yungoos to rid the island of unwanted vermin, like the Rattata. What they didn’t realize is that this has a far greater effect than what they intended. Because the Yungoos is not native to Alola, it has no natural predators there, and this allows it to live unchecked! In this episode, I’ll reveal how the imported Yungoos will DESTROY Alola’s ecosystem and native Pokemon!

Andre Black Nerd Review of Paddington and Paddington 2. Black Nerd Review of Paddington 2 and the original Paddington movie and how they are adaptations and reboots of nostalgia done right by being new and modern while still being respectful to the original Paddington Bear franchise. Paddington 2 stars Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington Bear, Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Brown, Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Brown, Julie Walters as Mrs. Bird, Jim Broadbent as Mr. Gruber, Peter Capaldi as Mr. Curry, Brendan Gleeson as Knuckles, and Hugh Grant as Phoenix Buchanan. The first Paddington movie featured Nicole Kidman as Millicent.

Sony have recently been in talks about a future Spider-Verse movie!!

Spider-Man has enjoyed varying degrees of success on the big screen up to now. While the first two Sam Raimi adaptations are still regarded as groundbreaking movies in the genre, Sony's overstuffed third installment and Andrew Garfield's more recent reboot failed to live up to expectations, halting plans to create an extended Spider-Verse that Sony hoped would rival Marvel's.
It was hard not to perceive Sony's plans with at least some skepticism. After all, the idea of creating spin-offs surrounding the Sinister Six and Venom were somewhat questionable but now the Venom 2018 movie has been confirmed and to star Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock!

Whether Marvel's vision will incorporate Sony's previously proposed spin-offs or try something new is unclear, but it's hard to deny that Spider-Man’s future with the studio is looking very bright indeed. Tom Holland in Spider-Man Homecoming looks ""Spectacular"" and will hopefully make the studios secure future Spidey movies! We would love to see Marvel & Sony bring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back somehow as alternate Spider-Men in a huge Spider-Verse Movie crossover, perhaps even with Miles Morales (Donald Glover?) along side them.

Note that I honestly believe Rey's journey in the sequel trilogy is more akin to a Heroine's Journey (written by Maureen Murdock) but I wanted to make the comparison to Luke's journey as that does seem to be what people do when arguing that Rey is a Mary Sue. I want to make a future video in which I use the Heroine's journey to discuss Rey's journey thus far.

Lindsey Randy - Hi John I love your show. I just heard that Joss Whedon has officially left Batgirl, and that fact he's been around Marvel lately, and with all the Black Widow movie news. Do u think it's possible that he could be doing the Black Widow movie ? Keep up the great work and bring on the filthy.

PATREON Supporter Jonathan Hogan - What are your thoughts about the copyright lawsuit being brought against The Shape of Water filmmakers? Do you think the suit will hurt the film's Oscar chances?

PATREON Supporter Jeff Bingham - Hey, John. Did you get a chance to read Brendan Fraser's GQ profile? It's really disheartening to read what happened to him. In all the movies I've seen in my life, I think he really is one of the most likable acting presences that's been working in Hollywood. And he's even given some quality performances in high caliber films.
