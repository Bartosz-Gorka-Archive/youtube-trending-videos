LOL HI ANGELS!

Today we are going on a shopping spree: IN THE KIDS SECTION!

NO, I still am not pregnant and have no baby lol, but one of my favorite budget saving tips has always been to shop for deals on clothes and shoes in kids sizes! It doesn't always work (lol) but it's always a fun life hack and adventure challenge!

So here is me - wearing kid's clothes, shopping in the kids section!

...for myself. lol.

1,422,000 kisses!

Jay-Z sat down with Dean Baquet of the New York Times for an interview back in September where he addressed everything from his beef with Kanye to the fact that he cheated on Yonce. The over 30 minute interview has now been released and you best believe we have the details on why Jay says he cheated on my President. 
If you’ve heard Beyonce’s Lemonade album, you know that she does not tread lightly when it comes to talking about the pain she went through as a direct result of someone she loves’ infidelity. Jay-Z.  In fact it was arguably one of the most vulnerable pieces of art Beyonce has ever released. When asked In the New York Times interview if Beyonce’s extremely blatant and honest album pressured Jay’s album have to be  confessional, Jay said that they were actually working on music together at first, but then Beyonce branched out and created Lemonade. 
Jay of course went on to make his 4:44 album where he addresses his mistakes along with other very powerful messages about social issues and injustices in our country which I will credit him for, but I’m not done talking about Beyonce so back to my queen’s pain, Dean then asked what it was like when Jay & Beyonce listened to each other’s albums and as you can imagine, it wasn’t exactly fun. 
Heck yeah she is. Jay went on to say QUOTE – “Most people walk away. Divorce rate is like 50% or something, because most people can't see themselves. The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone's face that you caused, and then you have to deal with yourself. Most people don't want to do that. You don't want to look inside yourself, and so you walk away.”
As we all know, he didn’t walk away and they now have three beautiful children together, but I’m still mad and will stay mad because well, life’s not fair. 
Jay also addressed his rumored beef with Kanye saying QUOTE – “I love Kanye. I do. It’s a complicated relationship with us. Kanye came into this business on my label. So I’ve always been like his big brother. And we’re both entertainers. It’s always been like a little underlying competition with your big brother. And we both love and respect each other’s art, too. Everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You know what I’m saying? And then there’s like a lot of other factors that play in it. But we gonna always be good.” Plot twist, we all know Kanye goes to bat for Beyonce so I think the real beef stemmed from the fact that Kanye was mad at Jay for cheating on Beyonce and the Single Ladies music video. 
I’m done. What do you guys think about Jay’s tell all interview?

Areas of the forest that are dominated entirely by a single species of plant. In an environment with an unparalleled diversity of plants and animal species, these spots of regularity feel very out of place - almost mystical. Not surprising that locals think evil forest spirits cultivate these gardens. But in reality, there is a logical but very interesting explanation for them.

The new song is amazing, isn’t it?
Due to the absence of Yui-metal there are a lot of debates and negativity towards Babymetal and especially Koba-metal inside the community. We truly believe that now we have to support Babymetal and give them as much love as we can. Still they do their very best! They gave us really a lot, and it is our term to give them something they need. Here in Russia we say: “A true friend is recognized in troubles”. Let us be true friends of our favorite band!

Few visitors to Disney’s Magic Kingdom ever notice the parallel universe of cheap motels lined up along the adjacent highways, where struggling families live week by week. Breakout star Brooklynn Prince plays six-year-old firecracker Moonee, who runs wild with her fellow little rascals to turn the shabby neighboring area into their own private theme park, oblivious to the dark secrets unfolding in the adult world. Willem Dafoe, in an exceptionally nuanced performance, plays the motel manager who gets tough on the troublemakers but is quietly looking out for their well-being. 35mm film renders a visually wondrous world seen through the eyes of the youngsters. This bittersweet film warms and breaks hearts all at once. In the end, the magic belongs to the children and the human spirit of survival.

About the 24th Annual SAG Awards:

The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. This year’s award show is hosted by Kristen Bell.

CHECK OUT THIS EPIC VLOG! Thanks again to our sponsor Hot Wheels for partnering with us to make this epic track! Check out some more awesome HotWheel tracks https://youtu.be/fEGRJDPT7qs

Today Stephen Sharer and his brother Carter Sharer set out to make the most epic box fort ever. In the past, the Sharer Fam has built many Box Forts, they even built a LEGO BOX FORT but today Carter Sharer came up with the idea to build a BoxFort out of Hot Wheels track! So Lizzy Sharer joined in on the family fun and started building a box fort while Steven and Carter unboxed all of the hot wheels toys they got. Once Lizzy Sharer was done building the boxfort, Carter took so much hotwheels track and covered the box fort in track! Then Steven, Carter and Liz constructed more hot wheel track in and outside of the box fort and started racing cars in and out of the box fort, doing awesome stunts and hot wheel jumps. Carter even built the worlds biggest Hot Wheels jump out of cardboard and launched his car off the jump, it flew through the air, over the Stunt Bridge, It went through a series of turns and jumps and then down the long strait away and then landed in a loop, went upside down, and completed the epic Hot Wheels Box Fort course successfully! This vlog was super awesome! Shoutout to #HotWheels for partnering with us!

I’m Peter J. Kuhn, American Chinese Head coach of CrossFit Aftershock in Changsha, Hunan. Just finished 18.2. 8:01 was my Tiebreak time, and I got a 108 clean. I really messed up my first clean because I just didn’t rest enough. My tips: go fast on the squats and burpees so you have plenty of time to get a good clean. Wear a belt for the clean, it keeps everything nice and tight. I decided to power clean it because my legs were pretty tired from the squats, so I used more upper body for my clean.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yETLTR5G8I0/sddefault.jpg,0.013658536585365857,0.00034843205574912887,39.2,0.00031358885017421603,0.01400696864111498,0.014320557491289196,2018-04-17,08:35:00,Tuesday,1,9,31,9,26,47,254,0,61,0,1,8,10,4,0,4.0,7.0,['rr'],['rr'],True,['rr'],1,1,2,0,0,0,0,6.5195880162386874,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 1},1

LYRICS:
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
Long ago I was a little girl yeah I was never ever able to fit in
My teachers at school would try to tell me what to do but, yo I would never listen
'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said ""Fuck off and die""
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as fuck
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I close my eyes and float into the night I like to let my mind drift
Make a jump into a new dimension
Thank God I got that gift
Ever since I was a little kid
Always on that next shit
These whack copycat ball bags can suck my motherfucking dick
Sometimes it feels like coming from this planet people are so sick and twisted
I don't wanna fit in anyway, I'd rather be a misfit
Fuck a normal life, that's lame, me I'm insane in the brain
They laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at them because they're all the same
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

Production rumours as well as the rumoured director.
A Kenobi movie is something I've really been wanting to see. I think we could get a lot from this film...Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul, Darth Vader, and so much more...maybe even a young Luke Skywalker as he gets into mischief. 

I can't wait for everything that's ahed of us! Star Wars is about to explode even bigger, and I'm really excited to explore it all with you in the years to come. 

With that said...The Last Jedi...Luke Skywalker, Snoke Kylo Ren and Rey are only a few more days away!!!

Have an awesome day and as always, may the force be with you all!!!

Squawk seven five zero zero mane. World in a barell drippin’ some blood. Three dead riders grippin’ the reigns. of Saturn in da last plastic cup. Couldn’t make me into a hero. Couldn’t turn me into a coward. Whatever history that you wrote blew away in the wind on your way down from your ivory tower. Your words lost their power. You can aim down, fire. We’ll be down here living how we want. Never coming back. Never coming back. Run into a smack. With a hand to deliver. You always see right through me. When i am lost and out of place. You always watch me stumble down. While you wait for me to drown. Of all the ways I’ve given in. I can’t believe it’s not enough. To satisfy my endless search for any form of love. So I will stay my course until you break my wrists. Do everything to keep my silent. You wanna start a war with all that I stand for? You always see right through my, my masquerade. I know there’s nowhere to hide. I’m cellophane. I feel like I’ve gotta change. I feel like I’ve gotta stay. All of the handsome fiction will melt away. And when flame burns brighter, evaporate. You always see right through my, my masquerade. I know there’s nowhere to hide. I’m cellophane. All of the
fabrication will melt away. And when flame burns hotter, evaporate.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKNRX0Ku7s8/sddefault.jpg,0.006811707809711572,0.00023234802052714244,29.31683168316832,0.000668863237309571,0.007044055830238714,0.007712919067548286,2018-06-08,03:58:42,Friday,4,5,14,4,12,29,112,1,22,0,0,4,3,0,0,5.0,7.0,['ow EPO'],"['ow', 'EPO']",True,"['ow', 'epo']",2,2,5,0,0,0,0,6.416959234478524,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

The ""test"" in this video is a staged, comedic demonstration. What you see is real, but it is not performed in a controlled scientific environment and is not done pursuant to a scientifically designed clinical study. It is a demonstration performed on a movie set. The demonstration is performed on an uncovered Purple mattress and a leading brand of memory foam mattress. The people in this video are paid actors, not scientists. You should always use the specially-designed cover your mattress comes in, and you should use your mattress only for its intended purpose. This demonstration has no real-world application and does not test or otherwise demonstrate actual performance characteristics of the mattress.

An adorable pooch was so excited to see and play in the snow that it couldn’t stop jumping up and down, and hilariously runs up and down the garden to experience it. 

Tilly the four year old Cockapoo excitedly jumps up and down the patio door, just waiting to be let out so she can play in the snow.

Once she’s freed, she can’t stop running up and down, taking in the experience.

Her owner Mark Willett, from Moortown, Leeds, took the hilarious footage after spotting little Tilly desperate to go outside.

The ideal otto engine is something you may learn about in an introductory course of thermodynamics. It teaches important lessons about thermal efficiency, and it's the ultimate unachievable goal of every engineer who's ever worked on internal combustion development. 

But that certainly doesn't stop Mazda from trying. With their eyes set on the the ideal engine, they made changes from their SkyActiv-G engine to improve thermal efficiency in seven key areas. Most importantly, it's the world's first production implementation of compression ignition in a gasoline engine. More specifically, compression ignition timed with a spark plug: SPCCI. In this video we'll break down Mazda's SkyActiv-X engine, and talk about four of the major improvements they've made in pursuit of the ideal engine.

When you think about booking a table for a special occasion, do you look online for the best rated? If so, you might do so more cautiously after hearing Oobah Butler's story of how he became London's top up-and-coming restauranteur, without so much as sautéing a scallop. The Vice journalist managed to fool food lovers and tourists using Trip Advisor into thinking the garden shed he lives in was London's top-rated restaurant, thanks to fake reviews written by friends and some rather deceptive photography. He joins Good Morning Britain to talk about why he did this.

Would she opt for an elegant Alexander McQueen gown, like Kate Middleton? Or might she choose a piece that paid homage to Harry's late mother, Princess Diana?

In the end, she seemed to find a happy medium between classic and contemporary with her choice of a stunning Givenchy gown. Like many of her bridal predecessors, Markle's wedding attire was meant to be remembered in the context of royal history, so let's take a look back at all the recent regal wedding gowns, starting with the worst and working our way back up to the best...

Like all of you, I couldn’t be more excited to see Avengers: Infinity War. As a huge fan of what the Russo brothers did on Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, my expectations for Infinity War are probably a bit too lofty, but if anyone can pull this colossal movie off it’s directors Joe and Anthony Russo, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige with his amazing producing team at Marvel Studios.

With the movie set to world premiere Monday night in Hollywood, a massive press junket with the stars and filmmakers was held here in Los Angeles this weekend. Since no one has seen the movie yet, doing the interviews was a bit unusual, so when I sat down with Joe and Anthony Russo yesterday, I decided to use my limited time to focus on the future and not what’s about to come out. After all, since they can’t talk about the specifics of Infinity War, why not focus on what’s next?

During the interview, I tried to get the Russos to confirm if Avengers 4 would be called Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet, if Avengers 4 will be longer than Infinity War, how many post-credits scenes Avengers: Infinity War has, and a lot more. Trust me, if you’re a fan of the Russo brothers, you’ll enjoy watching what they had to say.

After my Spy Gadgets in Real Life $20,000 EBAY MYSTERY BOX Challenge Unboxing Haul video tons of you commented to do another spy gear vs fruit ninja video! I watched Guava Juice do another ebay haul youtube video, Matthias unboxed some cool tech and strange amazon products to put to the test, Papa Jake built a huge box fort and opened a Fortnite ebay mystery box, and even Team Edge and Battle Universe did some fortnite and mystery videos, all of which inspired me to make this video.  I also opened a gift from Lizzy, Carter and Stephen Sharer. I test and review a lot of friendly spy gadgets, spy tech and spy gadgets in real life (irl). It was a surprise comparing the cheap vs expensive ebay mystery box. The expensive opening challenge video can be seen here:

Surprise! Ed Sheeran secretly got engaged to longtime girlfriend Cherry Seaborn right before the new year. 

Maybe Ed Sheeran will play an Ed Sheeran love song at his own wedding. 

Ed Sheeran is known for making music that thousands of people play at their weddings, but now he’s going to know what it’s like to be on the other side. The British singer announced on Instagram that he and longtime girlfriend Cherry Seaborn secretly got engaged over the holidays.

He posted an adorable picture of himself hugging and kissing Cherry with the caption QUOTE “Got myself a fiancé just before new year. We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well xx.”( https://www.instagram.com/p/BeLG5CBlLYw/)

Ed and Cherry were classmates when they were growing up in England and reconnected in 2015 with a little help from good friend Taylor Swift. The “Perfect” singer previously told People magazine QUOTE  “I’ve known Cherry since I was 11. She worked on Wall Street in New York, and I had like six shows. It was around then, and we reconnected. I went on tour again, and then I went to Taylor’s 4th of July party. I was texting [Cherry], and she was like, ‘I’m in Rhode Island at a 4th of July party,’ and I was like, ‘So am I.’ I kinda said to Taylor, ‘Can I invite one of my old schoolmates?’ The rest is history.”

The pair has been dating ever since and even spent every day of Ed’s year-long break from the spotlight together, traveling the world and doing normal things other couples do. In fact, his hit song “Perfect” was actually inspired by one of the adventures they had at James Blunt’s house during their travels. 

Ed revealed QUOTE “We got really hammered and took our shoes off and danced on his lawn and then jumped in the pool. And then the next day I was like, ‘That’s a cool story,’ so I put it in a song.”
Ed and Cherry are at the very beginning stages of planning a wedding right now, but there may be little babies running around sooner than you think. When the redhead was recently asked if he wants kids he replied QUOTE “massively, yeah. I wanted to be a dad, like, last year. I'm ready, let's go -- tour bus babies, little fat, chubby babies that just walk around.""

Ed did say he found an angel in person, so it makes sense that he’d want to marry her. We’ll probably be getting even more AMAZING songs from this, just saying. How did you react when you found out Ed and Cherry were engaged? Sound off and leave your well wishes for the happy couple in the comments below. And then click here to see all the winners from last night’s SAG Awards. I’m your host Erin Robinson, thanks so much for watching Clevver and I’ll see you next time.

After taking you on a journey through geologic time, we've arrived at the Cenozoic Era. Most of the mammals and birds that you can think of appeared during this era but perhaps more importantly, the Cenozoic marks the rise of organisms that look a lot like us.

Thanks to Sean Murtha for the wonderful illustration of Tsidiiyazhi. Check out more of Sean's work here: http://www.seanmurthaart.com

And thanks to Ceri Thomas for the very cool Titanoboa reconstruction. Check out more of Ceri's paleoart at http://alphynix.tumblr.com and http://nixillustration.com

What's the 44 Club you may ask? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

This was a first for us and we were sooooo excited! We met Cinderella! Then we went upstairs and met Snow White, Ariel, Aurora, and Jasmine! It was so awesome to see all the princesses in one place! Although we felt a bit rushed and the food wasn't really that great, the princesses more than made up for it! We highly recommend it if you're looking to meet the princesses! Then we decided to visit the attractions that are sort of based around some of the princesses! We rode Journey Under the Sea with the Little Mermaid, then we rode Prince Charming's Carousel and went to Fairy Tail Hall to meet Rapunzel and Tiana! Then we also rode Jungle Cruise which has nothing to do with the princesses but we just love it a lot lol! On our way out of the park we took a look at some merch including the new rose gold minnie ears and the Black Panther magic band! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!

Shortly after that announcement, mama Evelyn Braxton told press that Vince has been abusive, and that she was worried for the safety of her daughter. She sat down with “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show” and opened up about all of that “fighting, cursing, and name calling,” she has been witnessed to, with the baby right there through it all. She says that Vince’s anger scares her to the point where she is worried that one day he will hit or push Tamar to the point of killing her.  When asked how long it’s been going on, Evelyn says “a long time.” She says when her daughters have pointed it out, Tamar denies it. But, she says, the bruises are evident, and the hospital visits for “bloodclots” aren’t a coincidence.

Evelyn shares her belief that Tamar is in denial, as victims of abuse- especially domestic violence -often are. Evelyn explains how love can make women blind in these kinds of situations, and why the couple’s alleged financial troubles should have nothing to do with Vince putting his hands on her. She also reveals that although there is currently no big rift in her relationship with her daughter, Tamar will be upset with her for talking. But if speaking out keeps Tamar alive and safe from abuse, she says she can handle her being upset with her.

She also explains why she believes it is beyond the family’s ability to rehabilitate Vince. “We have embraced him, we have loved him,” Evelyn says, recalling the times when the whole family has rallied around him and supported him. Evelyn even reveals that she has confronted him directly, but all he does is blame it on Tamar’s mouth. But the way Tamar talks is no excuse, Evelyn explains, and the fact that they are constantly involved with each other- in work and play -only adds stress to the situation. “There’s more that I could say, but I won’t,” she says. Check out this exclusive video to hear more of the heartbreaking story in this interview from “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show.”

Completely unapologetic and at times controversial, VET Tv doesn’t shy away from much of anything. 

But, according to Donny, the content is specifically made for front line infantry men to help them laugh about hard times. So, if you’re a civilian or even a fellow veteran, VET Tv will most likely call into question what you personally consider comedy versus what inexcusably crosses the line. 

VICE’s Erica Matson went to visit the set of VET Tv and talk to Donny about his latest show.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVIfmwNfrUo/sddefault.jpg,0.01332735275153486,0.00019904123798043232,66.95774647887322,0.0008354125199742088,0.013526393989515292,0.0143618065094895,2018-06-05,08:35:01,Tuesday,1,9,39,9,34,52,349,1,79,0,1,8,18,1,0,5.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.186911090642158,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'chair': 2, 'person': 2}",4

So hopefully you guys loved the podcast type vlog! I have never really done a car talk on this channel and I’m trying to introduce it on new and upcoming cars and car events. It was a blast filming but besides that the New Tesla Roadster is an incredible car that is going to change the future of cars! I was lost for worlds when the Tesla semi-truck came out and they out of nowhere Elon Musk surprises us with the world’s quickest car 0-60 clocking in at 1.9 seconds! CRAZY, RIGHT? Then also they do a quarter mile in 8.8 seconds and that blew people’s minds thinking about that. I still feel like I’m dreaming that Tesla came out with this basically electric hyper car. The design of the car was actually made by my friend’s brother and I love the look of it. It looks very mean, lean, and scary looking and seems like it would beat any car on the road, which it can now! But really motorized companies like every car company needs to step there game up so our motor cars don’t lose to electric cars. But yes, this was the first time an electric motor production car has beat the quickest motor production car. But in all seriousness, I love the car and can’t wait to take a ride in one or see one in person. So hopefully you guys loved the podcast vlog and I’ll see you in this weekend’s car vlog!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVOJ88id-yo/sddefault.jpg,0.01164714867617108,0.008210285132382892,1.4186046511627908,0.02825865580448065,0.019857433808553968,0.048116089613034624,2017-11-18,02:03:03,Saturday,5,10,62,10,45,65,505,4,79,1,0,6,2,3,3,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.793265039242673,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'laptop': 1, 'person': 1}",2

Lyrics:

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence, caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie

Brooklyn Duo Bio:

Founded in 2014, Brooklyn Duo has quickly established itself as one of today’s most successful classical crossover ensembles. Through its creative arrangements and live video performances, the piano and cello duo has garnered a huge following, with over 500,000 YouTube subscribers, and over 150 million streams annually on platforms such as Spotify and Pandora Radio.
 
On a whim, the couple arranged and recorded two pop covers  and released them on YouTube. Shakira noticed the duo’s cover of her song Empire and promoted it to her 130  million-plus fan base, saying: “We're loving Brooklyn Duo's piano/cello cover of Empire! Great work guys."" The boost that resulted from that exposure and the positive response they were getting on YouTube encouraged the couple to continue creating videos.
 
Since then, Marnie and Patrick have released over 70 videos on their Brooklyn Duo YouTube channel and 7 albums of covers, spanning artists from The Beatles to Metallica to Taylor Swift (who also tweeted about them, saying their cover of her song “Blank Space” sounded ""like a song people should walk down the aisle to""). In 2016, the couple started a second YouTube channel, Brooklyn Classical, with the goal of introducing classical music to a larger audience. With this new channel, Marnie and Patrick aim to showcase high quality, live performances of classical music. Brooklyn Classical often hosts high-profile guest artists, including the world-renowned Dover and Escher string quartets and percussionist Ivan Trevino.
 
In 2017, Marnie and Patrick partnered with Carnegie Hall and Ensemble Connect, a collective of some of the best young musicians in the U.S., to produce a cover of a-ha’s “Take On Me”. The video went viral and garnered millions of views in just a few months. Popular classical music stations Classic FM and WQXR regularly share Brooklyn Duo’s music on their social media pages, with Classic FM calling the duo “masters of the artfully planned pop cover.” One of their covers was also recently featured in an episode of ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy.

Official Music Video by CNCO performing ""Fiesta En Mi Casa"" (C) 2018 Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC

LETRA:

Con tus caderas
No necesitamos ni bombillas, ni estrellas
Pasar el verano en la bañera (quisiera)
Haces que me llueva en la escalera
Tú mi escalera hasta el cielo (mi cielo)
Contigo es imposible otra era de hielo
Deja que te ayude en la cocina
Lo que aquí comienza no termina

Hay una fiesta en mi casa
Nos cae la noche y tú me abrazas
Te llevo a la luna sin la NASA
Haremos travesuras y veremos lo que pasa

Hay una fiesta en mi casa (uh-uhh)
Puedo ver planetas en el techo (uh-uhh)
A cada rincón le sacaremos provecho
Seremos felices y eso dalo por hecho

Hay una fiesta en mi casa, uoh-oh (hay una fiesta en mi casa)
Hay una fiesta en mi casa, uoh-oh (hay una fiesta en mi casa)
(Hay una fiesta, hay una fiesta)

Cuando estamos juntos el mundo se detiene
Hacemo' todo lo que es bueno y conviene
Y yo te entretengo, y tú me entretiene'
¿Como me niego a esa boquita que tienes?
Buscamo' excusas pa' quedarno' solos
Hacerte todo, volvernos locos
Con esa carita de princesita
¿Cómo me niego a esa boquita?

Hay una fiesta en mi casa
Nos cae la noche y tú me abrazas
Te llevo a la luna sin la NASA
Haremos travesuras y veremos lo que pasa

Hay una fiesta en mi casa (uh-uhh)
Puedo ver planetas en el techo (uh-uhh)
A cada rincón le sacaremos provecho
Seremos felices y eso dalo por hecho

Hay una fiesta en mi casa, uoh-oh (hay una fiesta en mi casa)
Hay una fiesta en mi casa, uoh-oh (hay una fiesta en mi casa)
(Hay una fiesta, hay una fiesta)

Y cuando acabe la fiesta
Y estemos cansados
Allí abrazaditos
Nos queremos bonito

Hay una fiesta en mi casa
Nos cae la noche y tú me abrazas
Te llevo a la luna sin la NASA
Veremos lo que pasa

Hay una fiesta en mi casa (uh-uhh)
Puedo ver planetas en el techo (uh-uhh)
A cada rincón le sacaremos provecho
Seremos felices y eso dalo por hecho

Hay una fiesta en mi casa (hey, oh, hey)
Hay una fiesta en mi casa (hey, oh, hey)

Hay una fiesta en mi casa (hey, oh, hey)
Puedo ver planetas en el techo (hey, oh, hey)
A cada rincón le sacaremos provecho (hey, oh, hey)
Seremos felices y eso dalo por hecho (hey, oh, hey)

Hay una fiesta en mi casa (hay una fiesta en mi casa)
Hay una fiesta en mi casa (hay una fiesta en mi casa)

Hay una fiesta en mi casa
Puedo ver planetas en el techo

Hi loves! Today's video is about why I gained weight. I've gained around 25 pounds in recent years and I really wanted to sit down and have a chilled out, ""big sis advice"" style chit chat about body positivity, pressures on women to be a certain size, skinny vs healthy and so on. This topic is something I could talk about for everrr so if you guys want to see another video surrounding it, let me know by giving this a thumbs up. Also, just as a disclaimer, this video is MY personal opinion on MY body and MY self-love journey, I am not in any way speaking for or about anyone else. I love you guys forever and ever! xoxoxo, Carrie Dayton

We put together a list of 15 times when Gordon Ramsay actually liked the food! Like we’ve seen in our two previous videos, it does happen. It’s just pretty rare. That's why we continued to search high and low so we could show more of those happier times in Gordon’s life.  

Most chefs are incapable of satisfying Gordon Ramsay’s sophisticated needs, but every now and then a chef manages to blow Ramsay away. It doesn’t happen often, but we’ve found the rare instances where Gordon Ramsay actually enjoyed the food. Just like we’ve seen in our past videos, Gordon Ramsay has had a few moments where he actually liked the food that other people have prepared for him. We’ve done some additional research and found 15 more Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD from other people on shows such as MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, and The F Word.

As you have seen in our other videos. Gordon Ramsay liking food is not a hoax. This actually happened. So, hold onto your forks & knives, because you are about to be blown away for the 3rd time!

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 7 and Pearl, 3 months). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again! 

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi! 

Big hugs, 

Louise xxx

Every now and then a new artist comes along, who you know is sure to change music. 
Lil’ peep was one of those artists.
We were excited to find out that we shared a love of the same bands, and that he was a fan of GC. We looked forward to the possibility of touring together in the new year, and were excited to share our stories and maybe even make some music together.
there is a feeling of hope and rebellion in his music, for everyone who feels like they might not fit in, that we relate to and that shares a kinship to what gc has always been about. This rendition of ‘Awful Things’ was done with love, for Peep, his family, friends and fans, to celebrate his life, talent and career and we hope everyone enjoys it as much as we 
enjoyed making it. 
Thanks for all the love you shared, Peep.
You are missed, but through your art you will live forever.

Bother me
Tell me Awful things
You know I love it when you do that 
Helps me get through this without you

Bother me 
Tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that 
Helps me get through this without you

Bother me 
Tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me 
Love it when you do that on me

You like attention 
I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me

She feels the tension
It's just the two of us
It's just the two of us, tonight

Burn me down till I'm nothing but memories
I get it girl, I get it girl
Burn me down till I'm nothing but memories
I get it girl
I'm not the one

Bother me
Tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that 
Helps me get through this without you

Bother me 
Tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

Don't you turn your back on me
Let your tear drops fall on me 

Speeding away 
We're singing in the rearview
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
Goth boy, jumping on stage
Cary me away, cary me away 
Burn me down till theres nothing left
I will scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies, and gems
You can have all of them 

Bother me
Tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that 
Helps me get through this without you

Bother me 
Tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yZ7Ma4I7kwo/sddefault.jpg,0.028269692694738037,0.0006923504913470652,40.83147632311978,0.0010414185663716305,0.028962043186085105,0.03000346175245673,2017-12-22,06:47:56,Friday,4,10,8,10,8,57,65,3,13,0,0,8,0,0,0,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.236425561704678,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Lyrics:
dressed as goblins
nice to see the friends
dressed as goblins
do it all again

but in a way it’s all so surreal and cerebral
i’m tryin’ to feel good- i’m diggin’ the tempo- another memento for my long lost dream of life
on the outside lookin’ in i’ve got a power struggle- i can’t wait to win
we’re in a different dimension (we’re in a different dimension)- a dimension where you’re still a fish

try to breathe- don’t need to speak to me
hang on to the sights and sounds
time is passing fast
and i never want this world to end
 
chorus:
life- what a fuckin’ joke
ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
boom- now we all explode
ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha

dressed as goblins
we are at the show
dressed as goblins
now we all explode

in a different way it’s all too real- i’m still tryin’ to feel good
winnin’ or losin’-another illusion- another distraction from a bygone way of life
on the inside lookin’ out- i got a feeling it’s too late for me to pull out
from the other dimension- it’s a different dimension- a dimension full of nasty pricks

try to breathe- don’t even to speak to me
hang on to the sights and sounds
time is passing fast
and i never want this world to end

chorus

oh when the end has come around, oh when the world has let you down
and there’s nothing to keep you going
and all your dreams have come to pass- you never knew life went so fast
now you see everybody

dressed as goblins
now it’s time to die
dressed as goblins
there’s no reason why",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yZEKlp-H6FE/sddefault.jpg,0.014286133711441516,0.0007973200834278893,17.91768953068592,0.0008065310013591862,0.015083453794869403,0.01588998479622859,2018-03-15,00:57:49,Thursday,3,7,14,7,14,51,138,3,25,2,0,3,12,1,2,6.0,9.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.422115434098692,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

 #7. “Internet of Things”- Imagine a scenario where you spill the last glass of milk on your shirt and the ground, then almost instantaneously a new shirt it delivered to you, milk is added to your shopping list and the floor is cleaned. This fantasy may soon be a reality with the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things or IoT, something that many companies like Intel are trying to create.and it basically involves making everything from appliances and electronic devices to cars and houses smart and able to communicate with each other. You can already see steps towards the IoT in devices like Alexa and Google Home that can connect to your T.V. radio and certain features of your home. By 2050 almost everything in your home and the world around you may be connected and able to make mundane things like taking out the trash when its full or ordering toilet paper before you are down to the last roll something you won’t even have to worry about.

#6. “Gender Equality?”- Something that should have been part of society since its inception, gender equality has taken significant leaps in bounds in the last decade due to the changing of the guard in business and politics and the unwillingness of younger generations to adhere to the outdated and sometimes chauvinistic guidelines for women in our culture. Sadly at the rate that the United States is progressing it may not reach gender equality by 2050, as researchers speculate the more accurate timeline for this monumental effort to reach its head would be in 138 years from now. That being said countries like Norway and Sweden are already closing in on gender equality and it is likely, barring major setbacks that they are completely equal sometime between 2030 and 2050. Not only does a primitive notion of gender inequality need to go for moral reasons countries that are actively trying to bridge the gap have seen incredible economic windfall. Research has shown that these countries have seen a reduction in their unemployment rate and even an increase in gross domestic product. One of the more obvious reasons that having more women and diversity in general in workplaces and in politics is the fact that more perspectives and more minds involved usually means fast solutions to problems and more innovation.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yb8945pGXI4/sddefault.jpg,0.007444359842816009,0.0018711546371902926,3.978484565014032,0.002042108272580612,0.0093155144800063,0.011357622752586914,2018-05-09,12:30:01,Wednesday,2,8,69,8,44,44,508,1,85,1,0,5,0,3,19,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.428546110902486,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Can you make it to Florida? Send us an email. Thanks so much for the support. Meanwhile, Elayna who was waiting patiently for my arrival in Malta thought I was alone at sea. Houmaid (a man I had just met and asked to come along with me last minute) and I take La Vagabonde from Greece, across the Ionian Sea through to Malta. Very typical of the Mediterranean there was wind, then no wind, then lots of wind, then no wind again. We struggled through our night watches managing to stay awake through a very busy shipping lane. Negotiating the inconsistent winds and managing to get into Malta in short time I was then reunited with Ilyana (this is Romanian for Elayna.) It was great for us to spend a little time apart and for her to be able to hang out with one of her besties from home but it was even better to be back together again.

Here is a good explanation of True and Apparent Wind (also Boat Wind) which I hadn't heard of until now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xo0ySZ98oc&t=90s

Nota Bene: If you have heard me calling Elayna ""Buukie,"" Buukie Pants,"" ""Pants,"" ""Panties"" or particularly when we were in Italy ""Pantaloons"" it is a long story that we both think is hilarious but when we tell other people its pretty obvious that it is only funny to us. Like a bit of a cringy couples joke. So just as a small explanation that is why you may have heard me calling Elayna different names.

So the day after my Ten Year high school reunion, I brought together 5 students from different cliques and groups to reflect on what we thought of each other, what's happened since graduating, and what we wish we knew back then. Like and comment below what you think you'll be doing in ten years!

Scientists warn that Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is on the verge of a new explosion that could send ash, steam and sulfur dioxide spewing from the summit crater and toss six-foot wide boulders as far as a half-mile away in all directions.

""Primary hazards of concern should this activity occur are ballistic projectiles and ashfall,"" according to the Hawaiian Volcanic Observatory of the U.S. Geological Survey.

The scientists, however, said they were uncertain exactly when the new eruption would occur, how long it would last or how violent it would be.

The say that as the volcano's lava level falls, it will drop below the water table, generating steam that will send rock and ash flying.

""Steam-driven explosions at volcanoes typically provide very little warning,"" the HVO says.

It said the ""projectiles"" emerging from the volcano could range from pebbles to rocks weighing several tons.

The receding lava lake resembles conditions seen before a major summit eruption in 1924, said Tina Neal, scientist-in-charge at the HVO. That explosion killed one person and sent rocks, ash and dust into the air for 17 days.

Don Swanson, a geologist with the HVO, said the magma is likely to fall to the critical stage around the middle of the month but is uncertain how long it will take before an explosion occurs.

“We suspect it’s a rapid process. We really don’t know for certain,” he told reporters.

She took her inspiration from videos of artists dripping paint to mix the colors into the coloring of clients' hair. The results of the dye job depend on how she drips and combs the color through the hair. Drip dyeing can create multilayers, a hint of color or an allover blend.

This shape is inspired by Nakiri knives typical Japanese-style vegetable knife but with a western full tang construction and a general utility bevel geometry.
The steel is 02 high carbon. Handle is made of ebony and teak (or oak, not sure) both aged well by a luthier and white vulcanized fiber liners.
The pins are all brass with the middle one in mosaic made by me in a previous ideo.

Clarification:
With the words ""inspired by Nakiri knives"" I wanted to point out that this knife is not an actual nakiri. The handle construction, bevel geometry and thickness have pretty much nothing to do with traditional japanese knives. This knife has been made to be used as a general purpose knife, that's why is thicker than you might expect!

The annual Victoria’s Secret Fashion show has come and gone, but not before giving us all LIFE. 

If you didn’t tune in to watch the 2017 VS Fashion Show, well, why not?!

From Alessandra Ambrosio’s final walk to Harry Styles’ INCREDIBLE performances, the 2017 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show was not one to miss. While there were so many great moments on the runway, here are SIX of the best and must-see moments from the show. You know, in case you don’t have time to watch the whole thing and need something to talk to your friends and co-workers about because you missed out on it. 
Kicking off our list is none other than Victoria’s Secret veteran Alessandra and you might wanna grab some tissues for this one if Alessandra was your favorite angel. After 17 amazing years, 2017 marked the last and final show for Alessandra. She made TWO appearances in the show, in one walk, she wore an ensemble from the Victoria’s Secret and Balmain collab and in her other Alessandra wore a bright red beaded look. 

To no one’s surprise, Alessandra looked amazing both times, but it was probably this moment that made fans tear up. 
CLIP TOSS: Miguel VS Fashion Show 2017 Told you so (3:08-3:15)
While it was the last fashion show for Alessandra, this one was technically the first for Karlie Kloss in a while. And it was definitely a must-see moment when Karlie made her grand return at the Shanghai show after parting ways with her Angel wings in 2014. 

Okay, I know the VS Fashion Show is all about the angels on the runway, but let’s talk about someone else who made a huge splash at the show! And that someone is Harry Styles. Harry made his Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show debut at the show in Shanghai and his performances of “Kiwi” and “Only Angel” – we see what you did there, Harry -- were to DIE for. 

Those dance moves were pretty epic too. 
Though some may argue that Harry totally stole the show with his incredible vocals and show-stopping performances, Miguel definitely caught our eyes when he took the stage to sing “Pineapple Skies.”

Amazing, right? I just had to watch it again because I could NOT get enough of this reimagined version of the original song. 
In case you didn’t know, it was the first time Victoria’s Secret has partnered up with a fashion house for an in-store collection, so naturally their Balmain collab was a HUGE must-see.
CLIP TOSS: Harry syles VS Fashion Show 2017 Kiwi (1:50-2:01)
Something tells me the Victoria’s Secret and Balmain collection will sell out in seconds. 

And of course we couldn’t finish our list without including the BEST moment from the entire show. The entire line-up of models! This year’s show included some of the most diverse group of models – 55 models representing 20 countries from all over the world to be exact and I don’t know about you but that’s pretty amazing.

The coconut crab, which can climb trees, is the largest land-dwelling invertebrate in the world. They grow three feet long and weigh nearly 10 pounds. Scientists caught this one hunting a seabird; it's the first time the species’ predatory behavior has been documented. They say it scaled a tree and pulled the bird from its nest.

Coconut crabs have also been known to feast on chickens and cats, and even their own friends and family. Some theorize the crabs, which live primarily on remote Pacific and Indian Ocean islands, killed Amelia Earhart and carried her bones underground. But don’t worry —
these dog-sized crabs usually shy away from humans.

The Cloverfield Paradox has a relatively simple plot: a space station crew is tasked with activating a particle accelerator called the Shepard, which will create a clean and renewable source of energy for a resource-deprived Earth. Things start to get complicated, however, when the machine creates a rift in space-time, propelling the crew into a parallel dimension. Little do they know, this also sets into motion the events of the first and second Cloverfield movies. So, how does the movie get from simple a energy experiment story to an all-out monster invasion movie? Let's walk through the last bits of The Cloverfield Paradox and break it down...

To celebrate this years Super Bowl, I try to make my own football from scratch, starting from a pig. Using the parts of the pig that are normally just thrown away at the butcher, I tanned my own pig fur hide for the outer leather and use the pig's bladder to inflate the ball.

|| ABOUT ||
Today, getting what you need is as easy as a trip to the store. From food to clothing, energy, medicine, and so much more, Andy George will discover what it takes to make everything from scratch. His mission is to understand the complex processes of manufacturing that is often taken for granted and do it all himself. Each week he’s traveling the world to bypass the modern supply chain in order to harvest raw materials straight from the source. Along the way, he’s answering the questions you never thought to ask.

Kesha brings Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper, Andra Day, Julia Michaels, and so many more female musicians on stage for one hell of a performance at the 2018 Grammys. 

If you didn’t cry at any point in time during Kesha’s performance, you weren’t paying enough attention to the TV screen. I think it’s safe to say Kesha’s powerful performance of ‘Praying’ alongside a number of her famous peers gave almost everyone all the chills and feels.

After being introduced to the stage by Janelle Monae – who, by the way, had an equally powerful Time’s Up speech of her own – Kesha took the Grammys stage and literally gave us all the best performance of her life. 

In addition to Kesha’s powerful and emotional vocals, she was joined on that very stage and was backed up by the likes of Camila Cabello, Julia Michaels, Andra Day, and Cyndi Lauper, just to name a few. 

Tears, you guys. All the tears. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, but as soon as Kesha’s powerful performance was over and done with, an equally powerful embrace occurred on stage with everyone giving Kesha like, the biggest hug ever. 

What did you guys think of that incredible performance? Let me know all your thoughts about that star-studded performance in the comment section below. Thanks for watching our Grammy coverage.

Kylie Jenner, 20, enjoyed a day out with her mom, Kris Jenner, and BFF, Jordyn Woods, on Jan. 23, and now, we finally have a photo of the baby bump we’ve been dying to see, thanks to TMZ!

The sighting is quite shocking, as Kylie has been keeping a low profile since news of her pregnancy broke in September. Immediately after the news came out, we saw a few glimpses of Kylie’s stomach, but since then, she’s been sure to only be photographed from the chest up — until now!

Didn't wanna leave
I got caught up in the forest
Hangin' with the trees
Realised I'm less important

This video has nothing to do with the chops that you eat for dinner or lunch or breakfast (if you're adventurous). Did you know that if we write lots of words that are relevant to this musical song it can help with search algorithms? If we wrote words lke track, tune, comedy, laughter, music, Macarena, Gangnam style, dancing, kill me, Nut bush, oh god, dance craze, colourful fun with friends, chop chip and chop; it can help optimise our search-ability (that's not a word).

That’s when the lives of Rickey Jackson and Eddie Vernon became forever entwined.

They grew up in the same neighborhood: Eddie was the paperboy for Rickey’s family, and friends with Rickey’s younger brother. At the time of the murder, Rickey was 18 and Eddie was 12.

After hearing gunshots while coming home on the school bus, one of Eddie’s classmates told him Rickey was involved in Frank’s murder. Eddie  told the police and then became the main witness in the case against Rickey, even though Eddie hadn’t actually witnessed the murder. Eddie testified in trial because, he says, police pressured him to lie and threatened his family.

Rickey was convicted of the murder, along with two friends Wiley and Ronnie Bridgeman. Rickey served nearly four decades in prison, turning down chances for parole because he maintained his innocence.

He remained there until 2014, when Eddie, at the age of 52, came forward with the truth. This information led to Rickey’s release and cleared the convictions of the Bridgeman brothers. The murder of Harold Franks remains unsolved.

After his release, Rickey reached out to Eddie and met with him. Three years later, they sat down for StoryCorps to have their first in-depth conversation about what happened.

A set of nine newly-recorded tracks, We Out Here captures a moment where genre markers matter less than raw, focused energy. Surveying the album’s running order, it could easily serve as a name-checking exercise for some of London’s most-tipped and hardworking bands of the past couple of years. Recorded across three long, fruitful days in a North West London studio, the results speak for themselves: they’re a window into the wide-eyed future of London’s musical underground.

Nubya Garcia’s ‘Once’ is taut and carefully-poised, her tenor sax guiding a carefully-built energy to an explosive conclusion.

About Me ::


Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!


I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!


I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!


Big hugs,


Louise xxx

Cooking Oaxacan mole negro from scratch was one of the best food and cultural experiences I’ve ever had. On top of that, we didn’t really know what we were going to do when we set off in the morning… but things worked out for the best. Thank you to Javier and his family for inviting us into their home to cook amazing Oaxacan food!

So in the morning the plan was
Rent a van for the day
Drive to a village
Find a market
Ask a nice Grandmother or Aunty to cook us some authentic Oaxacan mole negro

Now, mole negro is one of the most complex and mysterious of all the Oaxacan Mexican food dishes. There’s such a huge mix of random ingredients in the dish, and no one knows for sure how it was invented or how it came about - there are only legends.

After renting a van for the day, our driver Javier came to pick us up and we started talking with him to see if he knew anyone that would make us Oaxacan mole negro from scratch. He called his Mom, and she agreed!

We picked up Mom in a place called Tlacolula de Matamoros, and we went straight to the market to buy all the ingredients for mole negro. Tlacolula de Matamoros is a predominantly Zapotec town, an Indigenous pre-Columbian civilization from the Valley of Oaxaca

We got back to the house and started preparing all the ingredients. Let me tell you, mole negro has to be one of the most complex and mysterious of all Mexican food. It includes so many random and seemingly odd ingredients. It was a lot of fun to learn how to make it.

The end result of the Oaxacan mole negro, was supreme. The sauce was so rich, chocolatey, and you could taste all the random ingredients in it - the nuts and dried fruit. It’s deliciously complex.

Mole was amazing, and having the chance to hang out in a traditional Oaxacan village to cook was priceless.

This comes on the heels of reports that Emma Stone turned down the role recently. THR has made it clear that the Cheetah character will be based on the version of Barbara Ann Minerva that is currently in the comic books. Is this the right choice for this character? And if they do go with Kristen Wiig, what can we expect from her performance?

Perri Nemiroff and John Rocha are here to talk about this news and offer their raw reactions to this story. They also explore which version of Cheetah might serve this casting of Kristen Wiig the best and if she has shown enough in her dramatic work to make this an interesting and exciting choice.

Technical issue: I found out the sound output was biased at 5V, I was planning to use the spare pins on the mute switch. To turn off, one would simply put the mute switch in the middle ""no mans land"" position. Too bad the switch is GND referenced which would probably not work with the 5V DC amp bias.

In this family friendly Nerf episode of Twin Toys, the new Avengers movie is out and Daddy wants nothing to do with trailers since they are nothing but spoilers.  Eli and Liam realize this and decide to show Daddy trailers via cell phone, tv and even internet pictures.  Daddy can't take it and saw that there was a strategy to defeat people who can't stand movie spoilers, as if that really is a thing, lol.  Will Daddy be able to stop the twins from spoiling the most epic and anticipating Avengers movie to date?  Or will there be another spoiler released but not coming from the kids?

Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein’s theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!

The world around us is definitely wonderful and we know more and more about it with each new discovery science makes. Although we have a lot of information, some things go un-noticed. Even the day to day objects like a crack in a piece of steel, the beauty of a human tongue, or the amazing structure of the human bone.

When we put some of our daily items under an electron microscope, we discover entirely new worlds that amaze, and shock us through their astonishing construction.

These pics we show here are nothing but a scratch on the surface of the micro worlds that are all around us. From the drop of a sea water to the beautiful plankton or the super chalk structure, we have it all.

I do not own any of these images. If you want me to credit you for your work, please provide me the link to it, and I'll add it inside this description.

Here are the most interesting ways People hide things!

10 - Stuffed Animals

Stuffed toys and real animals are basically the same thing, right? At least that’s what our parents used to tell us when we were nagging them for a dog!   Apparently, that’s what this lady thought too.
Airport security officials in Bangkok detected something suspicious in an oversize suitcase. The scan indicated that along with stuffed animals, this lady’s suitcase also somehow had bones somewhere.
´When they opened the suitcase for inspection, the team of investigators found something I guess no one expected. The BONES belonged to a tranquilized two-month-old tiger!  A LIVE tiger cub was hidden in the suitcase along with some stuffed toys!  I mean…...wouldn’t it have been smarter to pretend the tiger cub was an exotic cat with some fake papers?!
The suitcase, which had been checked by a 31-year old Thai woman, was en route to Iran, for who knows what.  The tiger cub ended up under the protection of Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.

9 - The lizard menagerie
In 2010, a German man was arrested as he tried to hop on a flight from New Zealand when officials discovered a small, let’s just call it, “menagerie” of rare lizards hidden in his underwear.  This is the PERFECT moment to use the word “menagerie” in real life!
Anyways, they found 44 lizards in this dudes underwear. Apparently, this guy admitted to being a dealer of endangered animals and pled guilty in court to charges of trading  exploited species and hunting protected wildlife.
So how did this guy manage to have a “menagerie” of lizards?  He had altered his underwear with eight hand-sewn compartments in order to carry geckos and skinks around. One last lizard, the luckiest of them all probably, depending on the way you look at things, was later found hidden in the man's suitcase. According to the prosecutor working on the case, each gecko has a street value of approximately $1,500 in Europe, while the value of the skinks was unknown.

8 - Just be a hill bro

Blending in with the environment is another way of… hiding. The Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals in Oregon contains uh…..lots of rocks and minerals. Oh, and a quote ""gold specimen bigger than your hand,"" which is what made the museum particularly interesting to Gregory Liascos.
Liascos' master plan was to gradually chip a hole through the wall of the museum to get to the gold inside. But, the museum's caretaker noticed an unusual amount of dust buildup over a period of several days. Following the dust trail to an elevator shaft behind the bathroom, the caretaker discovered a suspicious lack of a wall.
The caretaker alerted the police, and they set up surveillance equipment at the museum.  When alarms went off the following day, the police stormed the museum, and found a bike, a backpack but no sign of anyone. But luckily, the police had brought along a tracking dog. The dog led its handler to a wooded area near the museum, where it suddenly started biting the ground.
Once the officers did a closer inspection, they found out that the dog wasn't biting the ground at all! It was Liascos disguised as a ummm…hill. Liascos told police he got into a fight with his girlfriend and wound up at the museum. He told investigators he wanted to try out his ghillie suit, which is a type of camouflage clothing designed to resemble the background environment.  I’m still trying to understand the angry girlfriend angle.
Anyways, police didn’t believe his story, and Liascos is now known as the ""Moss man"".  He was sentenced to 16 months in prison after admitting to breaking into the museum.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yzaumhmQgso/sddefault.jpg,0.0022476593850393627,0.0007391415665169513,3.040905134899913,9.71369682715924e-05,0.002986800951556314,0.003083937919827907,2017-11-22,18:00:04,Wednesday,2,8,68,8,47,54,510,1,58,0,0,7,1,2,8,6.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.539469399399352,1,['sad'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"{'bottle': 1, 'person': 5}",6

It recently came to light that director Rian Johnson was allowed to abandon the plan for the new trilogy as it was laid out by J.J. Abrams, which in turn contributed to Colin Trevororrow leaving episode 9. Furthermore, the merchandise doesn’t sell as it once did, and quite a few fans have mixed feelings about the Han Solo movie.

 In this postmortem roundtable, we will look back at Star Wars The Last Jedi, with new information at hand. Tom, Robb and Andre are joined by Mundane Matt to discuss how Star Wars has fared under Disney, and if it is time for Kathleen Kennedy to go.

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-fish-make-electricity-eleanor-nelsen

Nearly 350 species of fish have specialized anatomical structures that generate and detect electrical signals. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways to communicate, navigate, find, and sometimes stun prey. But how do these fish produce electricity? And why? Eleanor Nelsen illuminates the science behind electric fish.

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 6 and Pearl, newborn). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again!

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi!

Big hugs,

Louise xxx

This is also
the same island that is featured in both The Lost World: Jurassic Park as well as Jurassic Park 3, and the numerous differences in the landscape and vegetation seen in both films
of the series has become puzzling to some attentive audience members. One particular observation has led many to question the introduction of the star dinosaur of the third film
as well as its origins within the timeline of the series. The Spinosaurus featured in Jurassic Park 3 is shown to be, quite possibly, the strongest and most formidably destructive
dinosaur on the entire island.

This video is specifically dedicated to the possibilities of The Lost World Spinosaurus being a probable thing. Many have searched for the terms Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom Spinosaurus or Jurassic World Spinosaurus in general in the hopes of finding any information on the Jurassic Park 3 Spino but not much has come up as the Spinosaurus Isla Sorna is very different from the Spinosaurus Isla Nublar and the JP3 Spino will probably not make an appearance as one of the Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom New Dinosaurs unfortunately. Now if Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom Sorna does indeed become a thing than a Rexy vs Spinosaurus rematch between the Jurassic Park 3 Dinosaurs may happen but I honestly don't want to see that. Mainly because the Spino vs T Rex thing has really been played out and seeing another Spinosaurus vs Tyrannosaurus scene would really take away from the Spinosaurus Mystery and make the Spinosaurus Returns idea kind of stale. That is just my personal opinion on the Spinosaurus Jurassic Park dinosaur being used in another T Rex vs Spinosaurus segment and should be taken as such.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z1vGz5F86-U/sddefault.jpg,0.01474121392467466,0.0003318722047005576,44.418344519015655,0.0017581059971608964,0.015073086129375218,0.016831192126536117,2017-12-13,23:51:46,Wednesday,2,13,65,12,31,77,517,2,55,0,3,9,55,7,1,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.176379762930843,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0

Finally, the moment we have all been waiting for, our favorite wizarding world trailer has arrived, “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald”. We still have a while until we can line up to watch our Newt Scamander, Tina Goldstein, and Queenie. The most exciting revelation is that Hogwarts is back...and with Hogwarts comes a young Albus Dumbledore, played by Jude Law. With the thrilling, fast-paced trailer comes theories upon theories of what it reveals. First off, we know Credence Barebone is back and that Maledictus, possibly linked to the Dark Lord as Nagini, are present. Why can’t Dumbledore face Grindelwald? Does Grindelwald escape? Leta Lestrange, played by Zoe Kravitz, may stir up old emotions, but with an ulterior motive. Will we learn more about Voldemort?

If there's one thing Hollywood is never short on, it's egos. In an industry where collaboration is key, putting those egos in the same room can sometimes produce disastrous results that range anywhere from stressful productions to full-on fistfights. Here are some celebs that learned the hard way that they should probably never work together again...

ou need a suit - one that fits you like a glove! There's nothing better than an incredible fitting suit. In this video men's style, grooming, fitness and lifestyle expert, Aaron Marino of IAmAlphaM, AaronMarino,  Pete & Pedro , and Fashion Anchor talks about where to find a great fitting suit.
You can go into a store and get advice from a sales person. You can also get a custom suit made for a few thousand dollars. But today we have the Internet where you can get made-to-measure suits at off the rack prices. You MUST know what you're doing so you don't get a jacked up suit.

Alpha's Perfect Suit
Alpha demonstrates what a perfect made to measure suit looks like. He built his with Indochino. He customized all the details -- custom and perfect! They are the largest made-to-measure suit company in the world. Alpha has known about them for a while, and although he's used other companies for made to measure companies, Alpha realized they are the kings! The website is super sexy where you can see the suit you're going to buy. Use the special link for a special price.

Online Made-to-Measure Mistakes

1. Not buying from a reputable company - make sure the company has been in business and will stay in business.

2. Unrealistic expectations - online made-to-measure is not the same as a 100% custom suit. You will need to have some alternations from a tailor. Indochino will reimburse you up to $75 for alternations.

3. Going trendy or super cool before having the basics - your first suit should be a color like medium gray. The lapels should be notched, two vents, two buttons, pockets with flaps, no pleats in pants, and a fun inner lining. You can also add embroidery, pick stitching, functioning button and boutonniere holes, and more.

4. Not taking your time and getting help for measurements - Indochino has videos to walk you through the measurements. Once you nail the fit, you know future suits will fit you perfectly like the one before.

5. Not wearing it enough - you can wear suits at other occasions than weddings and funerals. Lose the tie, pop the collar, and go out to dinner. Wear it, rock it, love it! It's better to be over dressed than under.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2paZjgZm28/sddefault.jpg,0.01831358905158804,0.0011019224029856678,16.619672131147542,0.0014776598781020922,0.0194155114545737,0.020893171332675792,2017-11-16,16:59:04,Thursday,3,11,38,11,24,54,239,3,43,5,0,6,0,1,5,4.0,5.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.540327151422386,2,"['angry', 'happy']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'tie': 2, 'person': 2}",4

FURTHER READING

“There is no more ridiculed genre than the self-help book. Intellectually-minded people universally scorn the idea of them. Self-help books don’t appear on reading lists at any prestigious university, they’re not reviewed by highbrow journals and it’s inconceivable that a major literary prize could ever be awarded to one of their authors.
This concerted attack on the entire genre of self help is a symptom of a Romantic prejudice against the idea of Emotional Education. Offering explicit Emotional Education is regarded as beneath the dignity of any serious writer. We should – if we are at all intelligent – know how to live already…”

Tyga‘s not giving up on his hopes that he’s really the daddy of ex Kylie Jenner‘s newborn daughter. Even though she’s already given her baby Stormi Webster the actual last name of BF Travis Scott, 25, that’s still not enough proof for him. Now Tyga wants to see a picture of Stormi’s face to check out if she resembles him. “Tyga has heard through the grapevine that Stormi looks a lot like his little son King when he was a newborn. Tyga wants to see for himself. He’s trying to get a picture so he can get eyes on Kylie’s little girl and be the judge,” a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

News red carpet fashion commentary with  former Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth, Giuliana Rancic's face was a mess when Elaine Welteroth described Solange's headdress.
Elaine explained that Solange was inspired by the Black Madonna and Saint Heron, who was one of the first Black saints.  And that Solange's headpiece was actually a durag and a crown worn together.  And she explained that Solange was actually carrying a bottle of Florida water.

Florida Water is traditionally used for many cleansing and protection rituals.  So Solange was definitely representing for the culture last night.

But Giuliana's face looked a mess while Elaine was explaining that.  She looked like she really wanted to say something negative. But I guess she held back because of what happened when she shared her feelings about Zendaya.

But a lot of people noticed her face, including Ms. Tina Lawson, who called her out for it.

2017 hasn't been Hollywood's best year at the box office. The rise of high-quality entertainment options outside of theaters, combined with sequel fatigue and rising ticket prices, have helped contribute to a series of domestic flops—leaving the film industry struggling to cope with increasingly disappointing returns on their would-be blockbusters. These hugely expensive, high-profile releases have one thing in common: they all failed to deliver at the box office...

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Lord Voldemort is one of the most iconic villains in film history. Harry Potter’s ultimate villain appeared in numerous films in the series. Tracing his history can be somewhat complicated as various details are revealed during different points. Follow our journey as we put things in chronological order and showcase the journey of Voldemort’s origins all the way until his death.

The youngest we see Voldemort is in a flashback when Dumbledore first meets the character. His birth name is Tom Riddle and will remain the name Dumbledore refers to him as throughout the series. Raised in an orphanage, Voldemort has a tendency for evil due to the hatred of his father. His wizard skills quickly grow as he learns about the Dark Arts and the creation of the Horcruxes, special abilities used to store pieces of the soul. Harry’s first encounter with Voldemort comes as a baby when he is struck in the head and the lightning bolt scar forms there. Years later, Harry is taken to Hogwarts where he doesn’t realize Voldemort is already waiting for him. Voldemort blends his soul with a professor, and confront Harry in their first battle against each other. In the years following, Voldemort sets forth a plan to become his true human form again and must use Harry’s blood to reach this point.Once he becomes human, his dark and evil plans take shape as Dumbledore is killed and the whole world of Hogwarts is changed forever. Follow our journey to see how Voldemort’s origins played out on the big screen.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z5kS_rDtpGY/sddefault.jpg,0.01204563883027883,0.0004332179538598357,27.80503144654088,0.0004964296301463024,0.012478856784138664,0.012975286414284968,2018-02-09,06:13:53,Friday,4,9,38,9,33,58,334,3,79,0,1,7,14,2,0,6.0,8.0,"['Pa', 'a', 'a', '=', 'o', 'ry', '', '=']","['Pa', 'a', 'a', '=', 'o', 'ry', '=']",True,"['Pa', 'a', 'a', '=', 'o', 'ry', '=']",7,5,9,2,0,1,3,6.224778171617726,1,['neutral'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

Rule changes introduced last season led to the introduction of significant aerodynamic modifications and wider tyres, all aimed at increasing performance. Therefore the new 2018 Ferrari F1 car has been created to make the most of the experience gained last year. Compared to 2017’s SF70H, the wheelbase has been changed slightly, with the side dimensions also revised along with the cooling system. The suspension follows the tried and tested practice of using push-rods at the front and pull-rods at the rear, however, their design has been updated based on experience gained during the first season running the wider tyres.

Cockpit protection

The most obvious element to catch the eye is the Halo, designed to protect the cockpit area. After two years of on-track testing, it has now entered the rule book. It weighs around 7 Kg, plus fittings and this has only been partly compensated for with an increase of 5 Kg – from 728 to 733 – to the minimum car weight set in the 2018 regulations.

Power Unit

The number of V6 engines that can be used over the course of the season, without incurring a penalty, continues to decrease, this year from 4 to 3. The same number applies to the turbo-compressor and MGU-H – the energy recovery system attached to the turbo – while only 2 MGU-K -the device that generates kinetic energy linked to the transmission – are allowed over the year, a figure which also applies to the electronic control unit and the batteries. Therefore those in the engine department have also based their work on these new parameters.

The programme

After it’s launch on Thursday 22nd February, the SF71H will be transported to Barcelona’s Catalunya Circuit, for a filming day on Sunday 25th, followed by the start of testing proper on Monday 26th. The first session runs to the end of Thursday 1st March, while the second test takes place at the same circuit from 6th  to 9th March. Both Scuderia Ferrari race drivers, Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel will be driving.

Disclaimer
I can’t guarantee that all of the make-up and skincare products I recommend will suit you. I only use products I personally think are good having tried them on myself and my clients but everyone's skin is different and it's possible to be allergic to anything. Wherever possible, test products out on yourself before purchasing.

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

I do not accept payment and am not sponsored to make any of the films on this channel. Some of the links under the videos and blog posts on my site are affiliated however and as stated before, I only feature products I like, or want to try.

There's more to it than just being royally fashionable. The concept came from early first sketches of Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Emperor Palpatine. The design was then taken and expanded upon to give us Snoke's room. ALSO - the room was Red to camouflage his Praetorian Guards against the RED wall, so that they may be better effective against assassins in front of their Supreme Leader.

Kylo Ren and Rey's scene against the Praetorian Guards was fun to watch, althought I still feel like they could have done much more with it.

Why does he have force powers? What is his name?
While resources are very scarce as to just WHO he is, I've gathered as much information as I can from canon sources to just reveal what his name is and where he comes from. 

Do you think he'll have a significant role in Star Wars Episode 9? Or was he just a finishing character for The Last Jedi?

And I hear from industry insiders that reshooting three quarters of a film can be expensive.

So why did a swashbuckling and not the worst in the series by far entry do so badly? The obvious answer is, given The Last Jedi came out in December of 2017, and with the opening weekend reaching less than half of the expected revenue, there just wasn’t enough excitement about this outing...

Shouldn't be here 'cause I should be dead
I can see the lights in front of me
I believe my best days are ahead
I can see the lights in front of me
Oh Jesus if I'm still your friend
What the hell
What the hell you got for me
I gotta get out from under my bed
To see again the lights in front of me
Hey I've been waiting to get home a long time

Hey now, do you know my name
Hey now, where I'm going
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes I see it
The lights of home
The lights of home

I was born from a screaming sound
I can see the lights in front of me
I thought my head was harder than ground
I can see the lights in front of me
One more push and I'll be born again
One more road you can't travel with a friend
Saw a statue of a gold guitar
Bright lights right in front of me
Hey, I've been waiting to get home a long time

Hey now, do you know my name
Hey now, where I'm going
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes I see it
The lights of home
In the lights of home

Hey now, do you know my name
Hey now, where I'm going
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes I see it
In your eyes alone
I see the lights of home

I haven't really made chit-chat videos in the past, and this was so fun to film. I enjoyed painting, as it helps me clear my mind and de-stress, and if you wish to see more of these let me know. It would be cool if you were to paint alongside me !

I didn't talk much about supplies, prep, etc. I hope to go into more detail next time, and I will link all the things I use in that video as well. For now, I have to dash and get to all the school work that is waiting for me, so wish me luck!

I hope you are well, that you make the best out of this weekend, and take care of yourself. I will see you soon, sending you loads of love.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Being the President of the United States comes with a lot of power, but also a ton of rules and responsibility. And it’s not just Donald Trump that has to follow the rules, but also his entire family. Sure, Barron Trump might get to live in the White House, and the other Trump kids can visit, but there are a ton of restrictions they have to contend with. Everything from decorating their bedrooms, to putting up the Christmas tree. They do get access to highly trained Secret Security agents, but they are forbidden from rolling down the windows of their vehicles. Melania Trump is the mother of Barron Trump, and she has her own set of parenting rules that he’s expected to follow. Do you think that you could handle all of these rules?

The team’s focus during the workout was on Thursday night’s Copa del Rey game against Celta, which is set for 9.30pm CET at Camp Nou and will determine which team goes through to the quarterfinals. Barça and Celta drew 1-1 in Vigo last Thursday night.

Besides Coutinho’s presence at Barça’s training center, the other big news of the day was the return of Samuel Umtiti, who trained with the group for part of the workout. Umtiti is still in the recovery phase following a hamstring injury he suffered in the second half of Barça’s Week 14 La Liga draw against Celta at Camp Nou.

Also on Tuesday, Argentina head coach Jorge Sampaoli, who was at Camp Nou for Barça’s 3–0 win over Levante on Sunday, visited Barça’s training center and took some time to chat with head coach Ernesto Valverde.

Jason Statham (“Spy,” “Furious 7,” “The Expendables” films) and award-winning Chinese actress Li Bingbing (“Transformers: Age of Extinction,” “Forbidden Kingdom,” “The Message”) star in the science fiction action thriller “The Meg,” directed by Jon Turteltaub (the “National Treasure” movies, “Last Vegas”).
A deep-sea submersible—part of an international undersea observation program—has been attacked by a massive creature, previously thought to be extinct, and now lies disabled at the bottom of the deepest trench in the Pacific…with its crew trapped inside.  With time running out, expert deep sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited by a visionary Chinese oceanographer (Winston Chao), against the wishes of his daughter Suyin (Li Bingbing), to save the crew—and the ocean itself—from this unstoppable threat: a pre-historic 75-foot-long shark known as the Megalodon.  What no one could have imagined is that, years before, Taylor had encountered this same terrifying creature.  Now, teamed with Suyin, he must confront his fears and risk his own life to save everyone trapped below…bringing him face to face once more with the greatest and largest predator of all time.
Rounding out the international main cast of “The Meg” are Rainn Wilson (TV’s “The Office,” “Super”), Ruby Rose (“xXx: Return of Xander Cage,” TV’s “Orange is the New Black”), Winston Chao (“Skiptrace,” “Kabali”), Page Kennedy (TV’s “Rush Hour”), Jessica McNamee (“The Vow,” TV’s “Sirens”), Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (“The BFG,” TV’s “The Missing”), Robert Taylor (“Focus,” TV’s “Longmire”), Sophia Shuya Cai (“Somewhere Only We Know”), Masi Oka (TV’s “Hawaii Five-0,” “Heroes”) and New Zealander Cliff Curtis (“The Dark Horse,” “Risen,” TV’s “Fear the Walking Dead”).
Turteltaub directed the film from a screenplay by Dean Georgaris and Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber, based on the best-selling novel by Steve Alten.  Lorenzo di Bonaventura (the “Transformers” films), Belle Avery (“Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead”) and Colin Wilson (“Suicide Squad,” “Avatar”) produced the film, with Gerald R. Molen, Wei Jang, Randy Greenberg, and Barrie Osborne serving as executive producers.  Jie Chen, Ming Beaver Kwei and Chunzi Wang served as associate producers.
Turteltaub’s behind-the-scenes team included Oscar-nominated director of photography Tom Stern (“Changeling,” “Sully,” “American Sniper,” “The Hunger Games”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “X-Men- Apocalypse”), editors Steven Kemper (“Salt,” “Mission: Impossible II,” “Face/Off”) and Kelly Matsumoto (“Fast and Furious 6”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“Truth,” “Pete’s Dragon,” “What We Do in the Shadows”).  The music is composed by Harry Gregson-Williams.
Filming on “The Meg” was accomplished on location in China and New Zealand.
“The Meg” is a presentation of Warner Bros. Pictures and Gravity Pictures (a CMC Holdings Company).  It is production of di Bonaventura Pictures, Apelles Entertainment, Maeday Productions, Inc., and Flagship Entertainment, in association with Beijing Digital Impression (BDI) Film, Inc.

Relationships are hard. Especially those between siblings. We have seen the relationship between Logan and Jake Paul play out in their videos, but there is a lot that you don’t know about their bond. Here is the Untold Story Behind Logan and Jake Paul’s Relationship. 

Jake used to spend his life trying to be like his brother. In an interview, Jake once said that he was always trying to imitate Logan. He even admitted that this was the case up until a few years ago. Though he may seem extremely confident, he has often struggled with staying true to himself and not trying to be like anyone else.

They are super competitive. They both reached Vine fame through a competition that they had running between the two of them. They were trying to prove who could make the best video when one video ended up actually going viral. So the competition turned out to be a good thing.

They are always arguing and making up. If you have been watching either of their videos, then you know each brother loves to make diss tracks about the other. It’s one of their favorite things to do. But they usually turn around and makeup within the week.

Whether it’s their life before fame, their opinions on each other, or their strained relationship, there is a lot you don’t know about these brothers. Stay tuned to The Untold Story Behind Logan and Jake Paul’s Relationship to find out what gift from their father changed their lives.

The superhero movie genre is one of the biggest and most popular around, but finding a consensus on the very best superhero movies ever made is tough. Which is why we at Collider Video came together to discuss, debate, and downright fight over the Top 50 superhero movies of all time. The result is an in-depth video countdown series encapsulating everything from Richard Donner's Superman to Spider-Man: Homecoming, counting down from 50 to 1 (plus honorable mentions) to result in a definitive yet still debatable list of the very best superhero movies ever made. Each video chronicles one film on the list, as various Collider Video staff members, personalities, and experts weigh in with their thoughts on the movie at hand, their initial reaction to seeing it, whether they think it belongs at its assigned place on the list, and how it holds up in the current superhero movie climate.

If you want to see heated, engaging conversations about the best superhero movies ever made, this is your series. We get heated on the merits (and/or shortcomings) of Man of Steel. We discuss the rise and impact of Marvel Studios at length. And we consider whether some of the superhero movies that kicked off the modern era of the genre, like Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, hold up in relation to what came after.

Panelists in Collider's Top 50 Superhero Movies series include Kristian Harloff, Steve Weintraub, Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Emma Fyffe, Thadd Williams, John Rocha, Clarke Wolfe, Mark Reilly, Jon Schnepp, and many, many more. Look for a new episode to roll out on our channel every week day, counting down all the way to #1.

I'm surprised that I'm uploading this. I was debating haha X'D

bUT WOW WHERE HAVE I BEEN ?? I haven't uploaded in a month asdggh I'm sooooo sorry for that !! I've been losing inspiration and motivation, plus being busy with work and school and aaaa. Also I've been editor's blocked and like FINALLY I came across this song and with the current episode I just had to edit this!!

Though I was debating on whether to scratch this video and wait until the season finale because the season finale might relate to this song more buuut I wanted something uploaded since I haven't uploaded in over a month and this will have to do for now X'D

Sorry if it's a little crappy! Had to rush a little because my laptop was acting up and kept charging and uncharging and if it uncharged it would like immediately die so I wanted to get this done as soon as I could and get this uploaded before Tuesday XD

aND HEY, REMINDER TO ANYONE WHO'S FEELING DOWN THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY! IF BARRY ALLEN CAN GET THROUGH IT, SO CAN YOU :D

im actually feeling down rn so editing this vid helped me :)

ALSOOOO THE EPISODEEE. Okay so I liked Ralph in the beginning, but recently he seemed kind of annoying? I mean I still like his character and I cried when he died, but idk I just felt like the writers were giving him too much attention and sidelining Barry a lot and the rest of the main characters. But he was a good character !! I just wish they didn't shove him down our throats and have him a hero one episode and him giving up the next and actually take the time to develop him without sidelining main characters :/ 

BUT I DID LIKE THIS EPISODE AND IM READY FOR THE LAST 4! CAN YOU BELIEVE SEASON 4 IS ALMOST OVER? I CAN'T.

Anyway, remember to always keep smiling! :)

Girardi immediately fell face first onto the ice as trainers from both teams rushed out to his aid. With concerned Tampa Bay and Detroit players watching, Girardi remained down on the ice for a couple minutes before sitting up under his own power.

지난 주에 저희 스웨덴 바이킹을 모시고 촬영할 기회가 있었어요... 저희 게스트 최초로 발효된 해산물을 좋아하는 분을 모신만큼, 한국의 홍어와 스웨덴의 삭힌 청어를 비교해볼 수 있는 완벽한 기회라고 생각했어요.

수르스트뢰밍을 제대로 먹는 방법도 배워보고, 바이킹 출신 크리스씨께 한국 홍어를 제대로 소개시켜드립니다. 한국을 처음 방문하는 분들께는 추천해드리고 싶은 메뉴는 아니지만,,, 혹시라도 북스칸디나비아의 바이킹족의 후예이면서 어려서부터 발효된 (썩은?) 생선을 먹고 자라셨다면, 한국 홍어도 한번 먹어볼만 하죠!!!

Last week we had the please of filming with a real Swedish Viking... and as our first ever guest who loves fermented seafood, we thought it was the perfect opportunity to put Korean ROTTEN STINGRAY to the test against Swedish ROTTEN HERRING.

We learn how to properly eat SURSTRÖMMING, and give Chris the Viking a proper introduction to Korean HONGEO. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone visiting Korea for the first time... but in the rare chance that you are from Northern Scandinavia, have actual Viking blood, and grew up eating fermented (rotten?!) seafood, then it's worth giving it a go!!!

Take this simple test to find out what type of person is the right one for you! You will answer 10 questions and see the number of points you get for this or that answer after each question. 

What talent would you appreciate most in your partner? 0:47
What do you look forward to doing together with your partner most of all? 1:18
Which movie would you want to enjoy with your partner? 2:03
When sharing your problems with your partner, how do you expect him or her to react? 2:41
What would you never give up for your relationship? 3:32
Which sound most appealing to you? 4:12
What phrase would be an absolute deal breaker for you? 4:48
All your friends are happy for you and ask you to describe your relationship using one emoji. What is it going to be? 5:24
What would your ideal honeymoon look like? 5:59
What's a perfect anniversary gift from your love? 6:39

SUMMARY
- If you have 100-150 points, you’ll be happy with an Adventurer. Trying new things together, traveling the world, looking for the special in the ordinary and being bold and spontaneous is what you appreciate most in life. 
- You got 160 to 220 points? In that case, a Materialist is out there waiting for you. Maybe that well-organized successful individual will walk into your life tomorrow? Who knows...
- Those who scored 230 to 300 points will be in a harmonious relationship with a Family Man (Woman). You can’t wait to settle down and start living with a person who will share your values and beliefs. 
- If your score is 310 to 400 points, a Romantic dreamer will come into your life and stay there for good. You need someone to chase sunsets with, to fly you to the Moon and let you play among the stars without living your own home and to give you all the love and admiration you deserve.

Niger, West Africa - 4 October 2017
1. UPSOUND (English) Various of Niger ambush
""Seven American and four Nigerian personnel fled U.S. vehicle one, evading under concentrated small arms and mortar fire. They moved to the swamp, broke contact with the enemy and stopped at the clearing on the northwest side of the wooded area. The team established a hasty defense at this location at approximately 12:50 hours. They wrote short messages to loved ones on personal devices, believing they would soon be overrun. By 13:11 hours, two U.S. unarmed, unmanned aerial vehicles arrived on station, establishing communications with both the team and inbound French aircraft. Two French Mirage aircraft arrived at 13:18 hours, but were unable to determine friend from foe. The French performed two shows of force at 13:20 and 13:25 hours. At this time, the enemy ceased pursuing the team but remained in the area.""
2. UPSOUND (English) Various of Niger ambush
""A team member moved into a clearing waving an American flag to the helicopters to establish their identity as friendly forces.""
3. UPSOUND (English) Various of Niger ambush

Niger, West Africa - 6 October 2017
5. UPSOUND (English) Various of recovery of the body of Sgt. La David Johnson
""On October 6th, as nationally controlled Personnel Recovery elements staged for the search and recovery of Sergeant La David Johnson, Tongo Tongo locals notified Nigerian military that they had found the remains of a soldier. At 12:00 hours, the Nigerian military arrived at the location of Sergeant La David Johnson. When Sergeant Johnson was found by Nigerian forces, he was beneath the dense canopy of a thorny tree. Sergeant Johnson was found lying on his back with his arms to his sides. His hands were not bound. Sergeant Johnson was clothed, though his boots and serviceable equipment had been removed by the enemy. The investigation determined Sergeant Johnson was not captured alive. His remains were transferred to U.S. custody at 15:22 hours.""
STORYLINE: 
Dramatic new drone video of the Niger ambush that killed four American soldiers shows U.S. forces desperately trying to escape and fighting for their lives after friendly Nigerian forces mistook them for the enemy.
It describes how the fleeing troops set up a quick defensive location on the edge of a swamp and -- thinking they were soon to die -- wrote messages home to their loved ones.
The video, released by the Pentagon with explanatory narration, includes more than 10 minutes of drone footage, file tape and animation that wasn't made public last week when the military released a portion of the final report on the October attack. The video depicts for the first time the harrowing hours as troops held off their enemy and waited for rescue.
The video depicts seven American forces and four Nigerians fleeing on foot, under heavy mortar and small arms fire. They crossed through a swamp, and at about 12:50 p.m. on Oct. 4, they hunkered down at the edge of a clearing.

Lyrics

Angel - put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again

Oh angel - we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began

And I know we'll find
A better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want - for you and me
Angel won't you set me free

Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun

When I close my eyes I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms - oh can't you see
Angel shine your light on me

Oh angel we'll meet once more - I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh! angel take me far away

Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
