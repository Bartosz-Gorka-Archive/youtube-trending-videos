Samsung has released their newest flagship, the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus. This time... things are a bit different. New dual cameras fill up the Galaxy S9+ and variable aperture lenses cover the sensor inside the phones. Pretty impressive hardware. And that is what we are here to test. How durable is the Galaxy S9?

With new aluminum and thicker glass we are already off to a good start while testing the Galaxy S9. The scratch test is first, followed by a series of other tests including a flame test and a bend test. Bend testing the Galaxy S9 is the ultimate test of structural durability. Hopefully it survives...

Fabulous Pizza Dough!  (Only 2 ingredients)

1 1/2 cups Self-Rising Flour & 1 cup Plain Greek Yogurt
(Makes 12 inch pizza)

3 cups Self-Rising Flour & 2 cups Plain Greek Yogurt 
(Makes 16 inch pizza)

Mix together like regular bread dough and let it rise for
15 minutes then roll or press it out to size.

Add pizza sauce then a layer of Mozzarella cheese
then add your toppings and another layer of cheese.
Now put on your final topping.

Bake at 450 degrees until pizza crust is golden brown
on the edges and the cheese starts to bubble and get
some color also...  cool a bit and cut with a pizza cutter!

P.S. You can add 1 tsp. of sugar to the flour 
if you like your dough a little sweeter!

Enjoy!

This was my second time in the UK, and I spent less time on this trip at tourist locations and more time with Fiona’s family just outside of London. This recent visit felt a lot more authentic than my first trip to the UK in 2012, and I felt like I was able to get a much better sense of the culture in England.
We hope you find these highlights and tips both fun and potentially helpful when visiting the UK!

Meet in this video the 10 breeds of the smallest cats in the world.

-HIMALAYAN CAT
Do you love the Persian cat? And what about the Siamese cat? Well, look no further:  we have the ideal pussycat for you: The Himalayan cat, also known as the Himalayan or Colorpoint Persian.

-BOMBAY CAT
This cat sure is a beast! Or at least it seems like it, with a look very similar to that of a panther, the Bombay cat is the magnificent result between the crossbreed of a Burmese and an American Shortair cats.

-BALINESE CAT
The Balinese is a cat that has its origins in the United States, becoming the direct descendant of the Siamese and other cats with long hair like the dazzling Angora.

-SPHYNX
This is a cat from another planet! Or at least that's what we think when we lose ourselves in their huge eyes that seem to hide the secrets of the universe, or when we appreciate their impressive almost hairless body that blows our imagination, assuming that it could be a cat that has evolved over time. 

-BURMESE
So much beauty! White in color and with blue eyes, the Burmese cat, also known as the Sacred Cat of Burma, is characterized by being physically an intermediate cat between the Persian and the Siamese.

-DEVON REX CAT
Without a doubt this is the elf of cats. Just look at it! Those naughty pointed ears, those huge, bulging eyes, along with those high cheekbones. Doesn’t it look like a pixie? Simply irresistible!

-SKOOKUM CAT
And one of the cats with more personality on this list is the intrepid Skookum, a cat breed originally from the United States. 

-SINGAPURA
Slender and small, Singapura cats are the best representation of all the delicacy and elegance that cats have.

-SCOTTISH FOLD 
This beautiful pussycat is recognized easily because of its chunky body that measures no more than 10 inches, its very round head, its tender folded ears and its short, but very sturdy legs. 

-MUNCHKIN
No! It is not floating! He's just walking peacefully, but because his paws are so short, you can hardly see them.

What Would Your Kid Do? Is the brand new show hosted by Jason Manford, which challenges parents to guess how their children will behave in a variety of situations.

At the end of the show the parents who have shown they know their child the best and correctly predicted their behaviour will play for a family prize with a twist – it’s chosen, of course, by the child from the winning team.

When was the last time you actually had to test your spelling skills? Your 6th-grade spelling bee? 
Autocorrect can sometimes annoy us and even leave us in some pretty awkward situations. But, be honest, we’ve kinda grown dependent on our phones’ and computers’ spell check feature. 
This quiz will be divided into simple, intermediate, and advanced sections with gradually increasing difficulty. And some of these words leave even the smartest completely baffled! Only 5% of people get all of them right! You’ll need to finish the sentences with the correctly spelled word. While you’re taking the test, keep track of the answers you get right. At the end of the video, you’ll get your results.

TIMESTAMPS
Easy-peasy level 1:05
Level up 2:48
“Spelling Guru” level 4:30
The results:
Less than 10 words 6:18
At least 10 words 6:27
10 to 14 correct words 6:33
All of 15 words 6:43

SUMMARY
-The first 5 questions of the test are a warm-up before the real challenge. 
-It’s time to move one level up, can you make it?
-Level 3 is a challenge only a real spelling guru can win at. Let’s see if you can proudly call yourself such a guru. 
-If you got less than 10 words right, you might want to consider working on your spelling skills a little more.  
-If you've chosen at least 10 correctly spelled words, your level is that of an extremely smart sixth-grader.
-If your score is from 10 to 14 correct words, not too shabby! You can be proud of yourself for your spelling skills. 
-If you knew the spelling of all 15 words, you’ve passed the test that 95% of people fail.

Lyrics:
I know it’s harder each time
You haven’t got to tell me
It’s always on my mind
You used to find it so easy
Do you remember when we wrote our names up on the wall and we hoped it would stay there forever

I wasn’t ready for that call
But I’m glad that you made it
I didn’t realize at all
It killed me to hear it

Haven’t I told you enough
You’re where I’m meant to be
Cuz you’re mine and I will always say that
Haven’t I told you enough that you are everything
Cuz you’re mine and I will always say that

Your eyes look different this time
God knows that I hate it
Do you see the change in mine
Now I know how much I’m missing
I remember when we danced around the living room and I hope we do that forever

I wasn’t ready for that call
But I’m glad that you made it
I didn’t realize at all
It killed me to hear it

Haven’t I told you enough
You’re where I’m meant to be
Cuz your mine and I will always say that
Haven’t I told you enough that you are everything
Cuz you’re mine and I will always say that

Will you read what I wrote about you
Nothing could change you and me
How could I forget your voice
It’s always on repeat
It’s not like I had a choice
It’s become a part of me

Haven’t I told you enough
You’re where I’m meant to be
Cuz your mine and I will always say that
Haven’t I told you enough that you are everything
Cuz you’re mine and I will always say that

She lives in the Philippines and is the last master of the art of traditional, hand-tapped Filipino tattoos.

Whang Od is 93 and her body is adorned with snakes and millipedes. She is the last practitioner of a very special art form – and all she needs for this art form, are charcoal, water, a dash of sugar cane juice for shine, and the thorns of the orange tree, which she uses as needles. She’s highly sought after by young people around the world. The film accompanies Charly and Egan, two brave young men who have travelled to the remote village Buscalan to meet Whang Od. ‘Some wet their pants because they’re so scared,’ says Whang Od and laughs. Even getting to the village she lives in is a challenge: a narrow path leads through the jungle, deep down into a canyon and finally up into the mountains. ‘You can fly to the Moon, but you can’t build a road to Buscalan,’ say the people in Kalinga province, a region more remote and unexplored than any other in the country. Reporter Philipp Abresch took the trek upon himself - with the help of twenty-five porters.

HPPqNMO9IaU,thIRJLsnIxY,Visit The Netherlands - What to Know Before You Visit The Netherlands,Wolters World,19.0,2018-04-08 12:00:02+00:00,"['travel', 'europe', 'mark wolters', 'wolters world', 'travel advice', 'tourist attractions', 'travel vlogger', 'honest travel', 'fat travel guy', 'The Netherlands', 'Holland', 'Amsterdam', 'Rotterdam']",459388.0,7447.0,215.0,2121.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPPqNMO9IaU/default.jpg,"Read the Blog for More Information on The Netherlands: https://woltersworld.com/all-the-little-things-to-know-before-you-visit-the-netherlands/
Heading to The Netherlands & Not Sure What to Expect? Well here we go through the top things that tourists should know when they visit The Netherlands. 
1. It is The Netherlands, Not Holland. Holland is the name of two counties in The Netherlands. 
2. The language of The Netherlands is Dutch, but as a tourist you really do not need to know any Dutch as the Dutch speak English extremely well throughout the country. 
3. The Euro is the currency in The Netherlands and you can find ATMs all over the country. Credit cards are widely accepted as well. 
4. The Netherlands is a small country with a very well developed transportation network. Therefore you can easily take trains all over the country in a fast and efficient way. Make sure you tap in and out with your tickets as you enter your platforms. 
5. Biking is a very popular pastime and way to get around Dutch cities. There are a number of bike rental agencies throughout The Netherlands. Look for one near a train station and rent a bike for the day to explore, or sign up for one of the numerous bike tours around the country. 
6. The Netherlands is rather safe for tourists. Do take care with pickpockets and extremely aggressive beggars in Amsterdam's more popular areas. The bike line is for bikes only so watch out unless you want to get hit by a bike and yelled at by a local. 
7. Drugs bring a lot of tourists to Amsterdam and the Dutch/German border. If you are going to The Netherlands to experiment with soft drugs make sure you go to a ""Coffee House"" they have menus and trained personnel that can help travelers. We do not recommend you do drugs and highly discourage travelers from doing this. However, we do know a number of tourists do go there for that. So please be safe, and speak with the coffee shop attendant about your previous experiences so they can help you. 
9. The best things about the Netherlands are the quaint cities and towns like Haarlem, Leiden, Groningen, as well as the larger cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The architecture and museums throughout the country really are outstanding. And yes you will see quite a few windmills as you explore The Netherlands. 
10. The food is hearty in The Netherlands, make sure you try a bitter ballen or a traditional pancake or herring from one of the stalls. The market and food halls have tons of great treats for travelers. There are numerous international restaurants all over The Netherlands as well. 
11. The Netherlands is not a cheap place to visit, however the prices are on par with the US & other major European destinations. Amsterdam accomodation will be your biggest expense. Therefore you may want to stay outside of Amsterdam to have a cheaper and more Dutch experience.

They may be villains but these songs have an irresistible tune! For this list, we’re taking a look at broadway villain songs that we just can’t get out of our heads, sung by the show's antagonist.  We’ve included songs from shows like  Annie, Hamilton, Chicago, Anastasia, Shrek, Into the Woods and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Albatross breeding success has fallen due to warming air temperatures. Nests built of aerated concrete and mudbrick were placed on Bass Strait’s Albatross Island. On some parts of the island, birds struggle to find enough nesting material for quality natural nests, so scientists created the artificial nests to provide a stable and safe environment for the chicks. Birds with artificial nests have a 20% greater breeding success rate than those with natural nests.

// What is a Tesla Model S? (wikipedia.org)
The Tesla Model S is a full-sized all-electric five-door, luxury liftback, produced by Tesla Inc., and introduced in June 2012.[10] It scored a perfect 5.0 NHTSA automobile safety rating, and, as of March 2017, the P100D variant holds the record for the fastest acceleration of any production vehicle from a standstill to 60 mph in Motor Trend tests.[11] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official range for the 2012 Model S Performance model equipped with an 85 kWh (310 MJ) battery pack is 265 miles (426 km), higher than any other electric car at the time.[12][13][14] EPA rated its energy consumption at 237.5 watt-hours per kilometer (38 kWh/100 mi or 24 kWh/100 km) for a combined fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.64 L/100 km or 107 mpg‑imp).[12][15]

In 2016, Tesla updated the design of the Model S to closely match that of the Model X. As of January 2017, the following versions are available: 60, 60D, 75, 75D, 90D and P100D. Owners of the earlier 70 and 70D Model S have the option to unlock the 75 kWh capacity via a software update, adding up to 19 miles (31 km) per charge.[16] The 60 and 60D Model S, reintroduced in June 2016, have a US$9,000 option to unlock the full 75 kWh capacity via a software update any time after purchase.[17] In August 2016, Tesla introduced the P100D as the new top-level model. The P100D model has a 100 kWh battery, a 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time of 2.28 seconds, and over 300 miles (485 km) of EPA rated range.[18]

The Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country, twice leading in Norway, in September and December 2013;[19][20][21][22] and also in Denmark in December 2015.[23] Global Model S sales passed the 150,000 unit milestone in November 2016, with the U.S. as the leading market with 57% of global sales.[24] Other leading country markets are Norway, China, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.[25][26]

The Tesla Model S has ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in electric car for two years in a row, 2015 and 2016.[26][27] The Model S also ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in the U.S. for two years running, 2015 and 2016.[28] As of December 2016, the Model S is the world's second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf.[29]

The Tesla Model S won awards including the 2013 World Green Car of the Year, 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, Automobile magazine's 2013 Car of the Year, Time Magazine Best 25 Inventions of the Year 2012 award and Consumer Reports top-scoring car in its road testing. In 2015, Car and Driver named the Model S the Car of the Century.[30] After declining to recommend the Model S in 2015 due to reliability issues, one year later Consumer Reports added the car to the magazine's recommended list.[31][32]",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HQI0Hl8UsWU/sddefault.jpg,0.008592021448500459,0.0009427702145806203,9.113590263691684,0.0015910442566553266,0.00953479166308108,0.011125835919736407,2018-01-03,21:54:54,Wednesday,2,9,74,9,47,43,526,1,98,0,0,6,0,1,10,4.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.558866172761979,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'car': 2, 'person': 1}",3

There are so many to choose from. So, we’ve narrowed down the list of choices to let you know the Top 10 Original Series that you can watch right now on Netflix. And there’s been quite a few changes and additions since last year’s video. To qualify, these shows must have not been broadcast elsewhere prior to being released on Netflix and must have had at least one or more seasons specifically created for the service. Instead of using the scores from TV critics, to switch things up, I will countdown our favorites in order based on which shows we enjoyed the best.

I hope you enjoy watching this little 'trailer' for the book, I've also been vlogging the whole process and that video will be up next week! 

The F Word is a personal celebration of female friendships – the good, the bad and the complicated. If there's one piece of invaluable advice for women and girls of all ages, it is that there is nothing more important than creating and maintaining strong, positive and happy friendships with other women. I’m thrilled to be writing this book, it’s a tribute to female friendship and a celebration of how important the amazing women in our lives really are.

HUtRzcD-Qbg,k-w8GxCpsCU,John Collins 21 Points Full Highlights (3/15/2018),DownToBuck,17.0,2018-03-16 03:53:46+00:00,"['John Collins', 'Highlights', 'Atlanta hawks', 'Three Pointer', 'Dunk', 'Rookie', 'Scoring', 'Charlotte Hornets', 'NBA', 'Basketball']",2942.0,36.0,0.0,10.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HUtRzcD-Qbg/default.jpg,"John Collins is one of the brighter spots, maybe the brightest, amidst the endless tapestry of black that is the Hawks' season. He appears as a small bit of medium gray, nearly indetectible surrounded as he is by the void that consumes Atlanta. There is hope with Collins. There may be smaller amounts of hope with a few other players as well, but Collins has played well enough this year to be considered a core piece. Do they even have any other core pieces? Schroder maybe, just because they've invested so much in him.

Collins is doing nicely in his prototypical power forward role: dunk the ball, rebound sometimes, and that's about it. He's experimenting with adding some stretchiness to his game by shooting a few threes instead of the midrangers he usually takes, but it is too soon to tell if this is a permanent thing or just a doomed foray induced by the tank-like atmosphere in Atlanta.

He hit two of them tonight, which is pretty good since he's only hit 7 all year. Add in a few other buckets (only a single dunk though which is too bad), and some free-throws, and you end up with his best scoring performance of the year. A career-high, even, but I'm not going to put that in the title when he's very obviously going to score 30 in the final game of the season.

FURTHER READING

“One of the most meaningful activities we are ever engaged in is the creation of a home. Over a number of years, typically with a lot of thought and considerable dedication, we assemble furniture, crockery, pictures, rugs, cushions, vases, sideboards, taps, door handles and so on into a distinctive constellation we anoint with the word home. As we create our rooms, we engage passionately with culture in a way we seldom do in the supposedly higher realms of museums or galleries. We reflect profoundly on the atmosphere of a picture, we ponder the relationship between colours on a wall, we notice how consequential the shape of the back of a sofa can be and ask with care what books really deserve our ongoing attention…”

These women are able to come together through their frustration over male dominance and in fact use their newly formed sisterhood to lean on each other and understand that they must first learn to love themselves before doing anything else.

She’s trying to get the president to pardon a 63 year old first time drug offender sentenced to life in prison named Alice Marie Johnson.

A ‘Roseanne’ spinoff might be in the works without Roseanne. Rumors are swirling that the spinoff would star Laurie, John, and Sara. Two spinoff posters have been circulating online. One is titled “Jackie” and another is titled “The Conners.”

Lyrics


Don’t you have anything better to do
I wish that someone would hug you
Must be lonely
Being angry
Feeling over-looked.
You sit alone at home in the darkness
With all the pent-up rage that you harness
I’m real sorry
Bout whatever happened to you
 
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them
I hold my keys
Between my fingers
 
He said “I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup
And spit out better words than you”
But you didn’t
Man you’re kidding yourself if you think
The world revolves around you
Yknow you got lots to give
N so many options
I’m real sorry
Bout whatever happened to you
 
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them
 
I hold my keys
Between my fingers
Go on tell me
You’re just kidding
He said, she said

에릭남이 1년 반 만에 단독으로 공개하는 디지털 싱글의 타이틀곡으로, 차분히 그려지는 피아노 라인 위에 에릭남의 부드러운 미성이 더해져 
한층 더 서정적인 곡이 완성되었다. 
특히, 에릭남이 직접 작사를 맡아 어렵고 힘든 일들 속에서도 자신을 놓지 않은 팬들에게 감사한 마음을 담은 가사가 인상적이다. 
이번 곡은 어쿠스틱 버전으로 편곡한 라이브 퍼포먼스 영상도 준비되어 있어, 긴 시간 동안 에릭남의 음악을 기다려온 팬들에게 
뜻 깊은 연말 선물이 될 것으로 보인다.

Being one of Oprah Winfrey's best friends sounds like a dream come true for many, but there's just one lady who must hold this honour. Her name is Gayle King, and she is the jelly to Winfrey's peanut butter, her ride or die, and a permanent fixture in the media mogul's life.
Oprah and Gayle's relationship started off just like most friendships. They were complete strangers up till they became colleagues in a Baltimore television channel in the 1980s. Ever since then, they've demonstrated their loyalty to one another and have gone to intertwine their personal and professional lives, with Gayle King acting as the editor-at-large for Oprah's O, the Oprah Magazine, and Oprah  Winfrey snagging the title of godmother to both of Gayle King's children, William and Kirby.
With a bond that runs deeper than a regular friendship, they've managed to raise a few eyebrows from their critics, as well. Many naysayers are convinced there has to be a hidden, more salacious reason they are joined at the hip.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HazXYXGsr8s/hqdefault.jpg,0.0061006535759265965,0.0012987642736290571,4.6972754793138245,0.0007968200588965353,0.007399417849555654,0.00819623790845219,2018-06-12,20:29:47,Tuesday,1,10,49,10,26,62,356,0,37,0,0,9,18,3,10,5.0,6.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.629095969984437,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,{'person': 3},3

The music Greg Gonzalez makes with his longtime bandmate Phillip Tubbs as Cigarettes After Sex is hushed. The common thread in these songs is minimalism, heard in both Greg's guitar and Philip's synth, that lay just under Greg Gonzalez's barely audible, somewhat spoken singing. Yet, somehow, this sound that barely exists holds together because of the strong melodies in these songs. I find I sing them to myself over and over again.

""K.,"" the opening track to this Tiny Desk Concert – and the opening cut to the band's eight year-long awaited debut album – is especially memorable. The lyrics are simple and easy to remember: ""Kristen, come right back/I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed/When you light the candle.""

In addition to minimal music, the words to these songs are stripped to their essence and it's that directness and lack of mystery I find attractive. It makes each note and each word seem to count for more than they might otherwise. And despite the light of day and the office environment of the Tiny Desk Concert, the smoky bedroom laden songs work, maybe even, in some ways, better than in a club, where just the chatter of a crowd can drown out this gentle music.

So, dim the lights, maybe light a candle and bliss out.

The story of three girls’ rise to fame, STAR’s second season ended with CARLOTTA (Queen Latifah), ALEX (Ryan Destiny), SIMONE (Brittany O’Grady), DEREK (Quincy Brown), COTTON (Amiyah Scott) and CASSIE’s (Brandy Norwood) lives in jeopardy. Carlotta had been named the head of A&R for Midtown Sound, but her world came crashing down after learning Cassie killed JAHIL (Benjamin Bratt). When Carlotta confronted Cassie, guns were drawn and one went off. Meanwhile, Alex, Cotton and Derek each were on a flight to New York when a news report revealed that a plane had crashed – with no one knowing who survived. Season Three picks up three months later, as STAR (Jude Demorest) returns home from touring, and Alex and Simone’s fates are finally answered.

HeZlbwyfinc,g0K5QoEj7FQ,Blake Shelton Named People's 2017 Sexiest Man Alive & Twitter Reacts,Clevver News,24.0,2017-11-16 00:26:15+00:00,"['Blake Shelton', 'sexiest man alive', 'Blake Shelton sexiest man alive', 'sexiest man alive 2017', 'News', 'newsfeed', 'entertainment', 'clevver news']",28203.0,388.0,56.0,238.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HeZlbwyfinc/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

Hold up – did the electoral college have something to do with this decision?

Ok, don’t get me wrong – Blake Shelton is a fox. He’s hot, he’s hick, he treats his woman right, and he ain’t afraid to tell it like it is. But the fact that he beat out other sexy snacks like Ryan Gosling, Idris Elba and Justin Timberlake for this year’s honorary Sexiest Man Alive title has the Internet in quite a rage.  

Over the past few years, Blake has made his mark as one of country music’s biggest stars and a coach on NBC’s The Voice with multiple winning titles, so surely he wasn’t the least bit shocked to hear the news that he was dubbed the sexiest man in America, right? WRONG. His first response upon hearing the news was, “Y’all must be running out of people Like, Wow, we’re down to somebody who is somewhat symmetrical.”

All jokes aside, it was Blake’s lady friend of two years Gwen Stefani, who told him to be proud of the title she’s known all along. Blake said QUOTE, “She goes, ‘Listen to me, you’re going to regret this for the rest of your life if you don’t take this gift and just live in the moment.” But the one person’s ass he couldn’t wait to “shove this up” in his words, was his fellow Voice coach rival and 2013’s Sexiest Man Alive alumn, Adam Levine.

What’s some good friendly competition, right? Adam genuinely seemed happy for Blake, but Twitter on the other hand? Not havin’ it. One user wrote compared him to other actors who’ve yet to receive this recognition, saying QUOTE, “Blake Shelton is People’s Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night” when another user clapped back with, “even a straight man can see there's no way blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. i dont think he's even the sexiest man named blake shelton.” Yeah, ouuuch.

Some people even took it upon themselves to collect receipts from Blake that have stirred up a wave of controversy, including a string of homophobic tweets. This Twitter user attached some of Blake’s previous tweets that read, “If you haven’t noticed Richard Simmons is gay, you haven’t noticed Katy Perry’s boobs” and “I’m not gay, but I think Ellen is hot… wait a minute… what?”

But hey, if Trump can become president and Blake can become the sexiest man alive, then according to this twitter user, Snooki better start preparing for her Nobel Prize Speech. Man Twitter, you are SPILLING that tea today! But on a lighter note some people took the news as a little glimpse of hope. One person said, “Blake Shelton gives me hope that I too could one day be People Magazine's sexiest man alive” and for all you lucky 7s out there, this tweet is for you. It said, “I heard my dude Blake Shelton won People Magazine’s “Sexiest man Alive.” Way to hold I¬t¬ down for all the 7s out there. We appreciate you.”

If that’s not a way to end on a lighter note, then I don’t know what is! We’ve heard from Twitter, so now I gotta know your thoughts on Blake Shelton being this year’s sexiest man alive, so share all your thoughts down here in the comments, and after that, click right over here to check out our new show Dude View where our favorite dudes dish all their thoughts on being dumped.

This video is one segment of an instructional video I created in 2010 from a home-built electric car I made in 2008. Of course, battery and motor technology has advanced quickly since then, and affordable, commercially-built, Electric Vehicles are now a reality.

This video series covers ONE low-tech and simple way of converting a car to electric. Many of these same ideas and techniques still apply to  go-karts, motorcycles, boats, and lots of other projects. We hope that you enjoy watching these videos and learn a little something from them.

There are still a few copies of the original DVD for sale. Besides the video, the set also has a DVD-ROM with photos, web clips, and documents from the project.
All profits support our work and go towards future DIY Clean Transportation and Renewable Energy Projects.

A Christmas Story, beyond its bunny suits and leg lamps, is fondly remembered by Generation X-ers for its unfortunate portrayal of Chinese-Americans, and their alluring turkey alternative: peking duck.  Crisp skin, juicy meat, deep flavor, all wrapped up in a Mandarin-style pancake with thinly sliced cucumbers, scallions, and hoisin sauce?  Fa la la la la, la la la la.

What is ASMR? Here’s my definition: https://youtu.be/qAEM95ixp-s

Remember!
ASMR is not a medical treatment. ASMR is meant to induce tingles, relaxation, and sleep. Although it may make you feel better, it has not been proven to fix any mental health issues or conditions you may have. If you need help, PLEASE seek a professional. Here are a few links that can help you:

SORT OF...,Black Beard Projects,26.0,2018-06-08 18:14:12+00:00,"['restoration', 'hatchet restoration', 'axe restoration', 'how to restore', 'restore hatchet head', 'restore axe head', 'aluminum cast hatchet', 'aluminum cast axe', 'aluminium cast hatchet', 'aluminium cast axe', 'diy', 'diy restoration']",45018391.0,320844.0,42776.0,12291.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hh3OR6XyNMU/default.jpg,"Alright, how would you call this experiment?
Hatchet restoration? Makeover? Wrecking an hatchet head?

Yes, I know this kind of handle doesn't make any sense: it's heavy (1.4kg or 3lbs), slippery and so unpractical to make.
This project is just for fun, my hope is to inspire others to make something just for fun.

The hatchet is not branded, bought it for 4€ at flea market. For me it's totally worth the experiment and fun of it!

As you can see the mold I made failed, that's why one side of the handle (the one facing up in the mold) is not as clean as the other. I guess making a taller mold with way more sand would have made it much better. Next time!
It still came out real solid, I've beaten that as hard as I can and it had no sign of weakening at all.

I just started to list some of the stuff I use for my projects in this amazon storefront:

Index of operation and materials:
1:03 Electrolysis: water and sodium carbonate solution, parts connected to negative side and steel sacrificial anodes to positive sice of a DC power supply (car battery charger). 2-3 hrs at 10amp.
2:15 Hot wire foam cutter machine and high density foam (kind used as home insulation).
3:53 Smoothing the foam with 320 sandpaper.
4:13 Gluing foam piece with hot glue.
4:40 Regular white plaster brushed on foam to help with cast quality.
5:20 Lost foam mold preparation by sifting fine sand (I'm using burned out petrobond sand but any fine and dry sand would work)
6:22 Adding sodium carbonate as degassing agent and ""lite salt"" (a mix of potasium cloride and sodium cloride) as flux to the molten aluminum.
11:15 Peening a 10mm round stock pin.
11:49 Polishing the handle (previously sanded to 400grit) with coarse and fine polishing pompound on two cotton wheel (only coarse polishing shown in video).
12:27 Re-grinding bevels and sharpening on 200 grit belt.

For those of you worried about the molten aluminum tempering the hatchet steel:
I tested the edge with my hardness test files and it results between 45 and 50 Rc.
Unfortunately I forgot to record the testing before uploading the video (actually a friend on Patreon remembered me about that) so if you don't trust me here are some considerations:
The hatchet is most probably made of something like 1050 steel. These steels are tempered between 400-1000°F (200-540°C) with hardness going from 50 ro 30 on the Rockwell scale accordingly.
Considering that aluminum melts at 1200°F (650°C) I think it's safe to say it can't possibly heat up the steel more than 800°F (420°C) or so, in color temperature terms just over blue, and I think the edge can't even go above brown that is around 480°F (250°C). So at the end I think the edge does get tempered by the aluminum but not that much to be a problem. Also, the fact that the steel was already tempered does not make any difference in the steel structure, tempering depends (after a minimum time) all on max temperature reached instead of time at temperature or thermal cycles.

That's all!
Thank you a lot for watching. See you next week!

Some of the best films are subjective, meaning their stories can be interpreted a number of different ways depending on the viewer's own experiences. But an excessively ambiguous ending or a sudden shift in tone can leave audiences scratching their heads in confusion. Don't worry — we're here to explain some of the most baffling movie endings that don't mean exactly what you think they do. Beware, however: There are spoilers ahead…

Live Like a Dream
Thirty Seconds To Mars

All of a sudden
It was midnight
Wild and haunting

And we were running till the sunrise
All we wanted

The last night we’ll ever do this
The last night time to go
You and me

Live like a dream
Broken but free
Live like a dream
Everybody sing oh oh oh Oh oh oh

Sing!

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

All of a sudden in the sky
There was a bright light
Wild and haunting

In every moment is a lifetime
But what life?
Whose time?

It’s the last night
We’ll ever do this
Last night to say goodbye
You and me

Live like a dream
Broken but free
Live like a dream
Everybody sing oh oh oh

Sing!

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh

Wild and Haunting
Wild and Haunting

Live like a dream
Broken but free
Live like a dream

Everybody sing oh oh oh

Live like a dream

Live like a dream
Everybody sing

Youtube locked this animation for ""misleading tags/thumbnail"" and have ignored all attempts to contact them about it for almost a year so I'm reuploading it.

The end credits and description represent the patrons and patreon rewards relevant during the time this was published back in august of 2017, and not current patrons in 2018.

The file was kinda mucked up and muddled so the end credits don't display correctly, not much I can't do about that right now - sorry!

****hey thx for reading the description, muah****

The Alienist is an upcoming American drama television series based on the novel of same name by Caleb Carr. The psychological thriller drama is set in 1896, when a series of gruesome murders of boy prostitutes has gripped the city.

Joining them in the probe is Sara Howard, a headstrong secretary at Police Headquarters.

Voters dismissed many of the allegations against Moore — while saying behavior that was acceptable in Alabama decades ago shouldn’t be measured by modern standards.

“Forty years ago in Alabama, there's a lotta mamas and daddies that would be thrilled that their 14 year-old was getting hit on by a district attorney,” one voter said. “There was still clothes on,” another voter said of the first allegations against Moore. “As soon as the girl said she wasn't comfortable, he took her home.”

The panel was compiled and moderated by Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster well known for arranging focus groups with GOP voters.

This segment originally aired Dec. 8, 2017, on VICE News Tonight on HBO.

The sisters caught Beyoncé’s attention with their viral YouTube rendition of “Pretty Hurts,” and went on to appear in the singer’s visual album 'Lemonade.' Since then, the proteges have been successfully establishing their careers with hits like “Drop” and “Fall.”

“The Kids Are Aright” is their latest song that dropped back in January, and it will also appear on their debut album of the same name. Chloe x Halle tell Genius that they wanted to create a song that represents the responsibility and intelligence their generation posseses, while also giving older generations reassurance for the future.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hlb7Ywdz6qw/sddefault.jpg,0.009278584392014521,0.00028735632183908046,32.28947368421053,0.0004310344827586207,0.0095659407138536,0.00999697519661222,2018-02-21,09:35:00,Wednesday,2,8,46,8,41,57,432,1,97,0,1,7,22,1,0,6.0,8.0,['1 eaSEVELT'],"['1', 'eaSEVELT']",True,"['1', 'easevelt']",2,2,9,0,0,0,0,6.446418512409908,2,"['happy', 'happy']",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,"{'chair': 1, 'person': 2}",3

LYRICS
As you look to the stars, oh, you could find
Illuminated in scars, a face aligned
I am saving the space between the breath
I am making your place between the breath
As the flame is to snow, first love to last
I will laugh in your face like shattered glass
I'm saving the space between the breaths
We are saving a place between the breaths
Between the breath 4x
I've seen it
Ooh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Ooh, and I'll breathe it
(Between the breath)
I never said where I came from
You never asked what I was made of
You didn't need to know
You already know
I said it even so
You didn't need to know
You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say, I didn't need to say
Now I'm fine, although
It was touch-and-go
(Counting the breaths
Until you)
Oh la la 4x
The distance between us solved by a shrug
Just a shrug of dark matter
Just a shrug of dark matter
You thought you saw a new star, you caught a fright
You think you wish you may, you wish you might
Be saving the space between the breath
We are saving a place between the breath
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
Between the breath 3x
You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say, I didn't need to say
I said it even though
You didn't need to know
A sky full of messages, sealed up in bottles
Smash the omens, our days are not numbered
Scream in my mouth, I'll barely hear you
Flame to snow
First love to last
Brand on brow
First love to now
Questions posed
Uncut the throat
You don't have to ask
First love to last
Let's meet at the same time every night
Starlight on skin is a million years old
You never asked my age, you never questioned my rage
Let's meet at the same time every morning
The blood in my gut is a thousand years old
But you are the sweetest infection, you are the sweetest infection
I could never know
I didn't need to know
You said it even though
You could never know

The film from Disney and Marvel stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Letitia Wright, Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Sterling K. Brown, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. The film presents us with one of the most memorable villains in Jordan’s “Killmonger”. In an MCU full of some incredible villains and some forgettable ones, Killmonger is the first one to challenge Loki for supreme villain status. So the question is who is the greatest villain in the MCU now?

Kristian Harloff and John Rocha sit down to answer this question and debate it. Kristian is in the Killmonger camp while Rocha is still in the Loki camp. They defend their positions and explore some other notable villains in the MCU. Let us know which side you are on in this debate and what you thought about what Kristian and Rocha had to say in the Comments section below.

One of the questions I get asked most often is “who do you like better NASA or SpaceX” 

Who do I like BETTER?!?! WHAT?! Is that even a fair question! It’s almost like saying, who do you like better, the Chicago Bulls or the NBA or perhaps Manchester United or FIFA? 

Well, it’s not QUITE that simple… but hold on...

In this day and age of extreme SpaceX fandom, of which I’m 100% not guilty of, it’s important we reflect on the relationship SpaceX has with NASA, how they collaborate, how they differ and why NASA’s future role in space exploration is as important now as ever.  

And although I don’t think it’s fair to compare a government agency to a private company in general, there is one thing we’ll be comparing in my next video… and that’s their rockets… 

So, NASA vs SpaceX. FIGHT! Or, hug... I don’t know which yet so let’s get started!

⭐⭐DESCRIPTION⭐⭐

Jordyn returns to the world of Fortnite, leaving his old Player Unknown Battlegrounds friend behind. Although both games are battle royale style games, where people fight to be the last one standing, Fortnite is enjoyed because it is a more wacky and fun game for everyone, with extra mechanics such as building and destroying objects on the island as well as items like the boogie bomb, bushes, etc. The battle of Fortnite vs PUBG will always be a heated one, as people are very passionate about both sides. If it were between playing fortnite in real life and PUBG in real life, they would be mostly the same honestly. It's just a preference, but I think Epic Games and the developers have a great game.

We hope you enjoy our newest Fortnite short film! If you haven't already, please check out Part 1 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZqj-Jc2GdQ

The Golden Globes red carpet has brought some seriously memorable moments over the years, with so many stars donning risqué outfits that shocked onlookers. From mismatched shoes and shredded dresses to ballerina tutus and white shirts, we’ve found 10 Golden Globe dresses that left the crowd speechless.

You can rely on Jennifer Lopez, too, to flash some flesh. But this one particular Globes gown caused a big controversy when Jeremy Renner made a comment about it. Some stars gave use the most memorable Golden Globe gowns by teaming menswear elements with the dresses, such as Julia Roberts and Emma Watson. Emma gave us all a shock when she turned around, as did Kate Hudson.

Then there are the risky Golden Globe outfits that beggar belief, like Lara Flynn Boyle’s ode to ballet and Diane Keaton’s all-white ensemble. And Rinko Kikuchi’s Chanel gown left onlookers scratching their heads as they tried to figure out why sea creatures were clinging to the dress.

Watch our video to see 10 Golden Globe dresses that left the crowd speechless, and let us know in comments which one shocked you the most!

The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.
Joining Tye Sheridan (X-Men: Apocalypse, Mud), Olivia Cooke (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Bates Motel), Ben Mendelsohn (Rogue One – A Star Wars Story, Bloodline) and T.J. Miller (Deadpool, Silicon Valley), with Simon Pegg (the Star Trek movies, the Mission: Impossible movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies, Dunkirk) round out the cast. Directed by Spielberg from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline, Ready Player One was produced by Spielberg, Donald De Line, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman as executive producers. The film is slated for release worldwide beginning 30th March, 2018, and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros.

HtDIFA5KhWo,4ihuh6AKyY8,How to overcome Childhood Emotional Neglect | Kati Morton,Kati Morton,27.0,2018-02-26 19:24:09+00:00,"['kati morton', 'emotional abuse', 'emotional support', 'parenting', 'child abuse', 'psychology', 'wellbeing', 'coping skills', 'advice', 'mental health', 'therapist', 'healthcare', 'life hacks', 'support', 'personal', 'care', 'katie morton']",799719.0,36067.0,420.0,3677.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HtDIFA5KhWo/default.jpg,"When we grow up in an emotionally neglectful environment it can cause us to believe that our thoughts, feelings, and desires don’t matter. This can in turn cause us question anything we experience and struggle to trust how we feel. We can find it difficult to let people in, and constantly worry what others think about us.  
Those who have suffered from emotional neglect often don’t even know it was happening, because this type of neglect isn’t something we can easily see. Many parents who were emotionally neglectful give their children every material thing they need, and from the outside look like amazing parents. But if their child needs any emotional support or encouragement from them, they are nowhere to be found.
HOW TO RECOVER:
1. Start noticing/tracking your feelings: Print out feelings charts and track them each day. It may be hard at first, so start with the easier ones (often tired, sad, and worried are easier to begin with). It's normal for us to not know how we feel all the time, but give yourself the chance to listen to your body and acknowledge all that you may be feeling. 2. Try describing the feeling word you selected without using that exact word (ex. I am feeling energized, excited, and bubbly - when describing happy)3. Begin noticing your needs: What are the things you need physically to survive? How about things you need emotionally? When do they come up? Take your time thinking about these, and even pretend that someone you love had those needs to. What would you think about them then? 4. Self-Care! I know I talk about this a lot, but when it comes to healing from CEN self-care is our way of nurturing and caring for ourselves. Are there things you wished your parents had done for you? Let’s make time to do those things for ourselves.5. Accept help and support from others: It can be hard to let people in when we weren't supported as a child, but we need other people in our lives who can help us through the tough times. Ensure these people are worth having around, and that they are trustworthy, and then slowly let them in. 6. Set healthy boundaries: This is SO IMPORTANT! It’s okay to say no! You don’t have to do anything that you don't want to, and people will understand and respect you more because of it.

1.    With the Oscars approaching I wanted to create a new award. Best Scene. If you had to give an award to one scene out of all the movies in 2017, what scene from what movie would you give it to?

2.    Do you think Marvel puts extra pressure on themselves with massive numbers like we saw for Black Panther and other Marvel titles?

3.    How many performances does it take to be classified as a good actor

4.    When you look at the box office for Wonder Woman and Black Panther, is the branding of the DCEU just that much worse than the MCU? Was the marketing that much better for BP? Did the black community rally around Black Panther in a way that female audiences didn’t for Wonder Woman? Which factor do you think made the biggest difference?

5.    Has a movie ever put you off anything?? Jaws kept me out of the water, for example.

****************** About the Video *******************

We got a package from one of our super fans, thanks Larson family.  They had a fun idea of racing a hot wheels car through the waterjet, so we decided to add to that idea a bit.  Of course we had to do the double loopdy loop with a sweet jump straight into the water jet stream.   Thanks Addison for the support. 

So what's the deal with Mitchell's haircut fail? https://youtu.be/t4dDopgozm4

Mitchell is wanting to start a segment where he reads mean comments, but we don't get too many of them.... so be meaner.

Ernesto Valverde had all 22 available members of the squad under his orders on Tito Vilanova field, including Andrés Iniesta, who on Thursday had done specific exercises in isolation.

Summer just doesn’t want to kick in properly in Barcelona, and it was still unusually chilly for this time of year with the odd spot of rain over the Ciutat Esportiva as well.

But there was nothing cold or damp about the Barça players’ spirits, who know that they are just four games away from getting through a complete league season without defeat.

The hardest hurdle yet to cross is probably the 8.45pm kick-off this Sunday against the side currently ranked third and massive 15 points adrift of the already mathematically confirmed champions.

I always enjoyed watching these kinds of videos so I decided to record my own college decision reactions! I'll post regular videos soon so stay tuned! (sorry if this seems super irrelevant to you!!!)

I'm so so so grateful for my parents and friends and everyone who supported me throughout this journey. Also thanks to every school that decided to offer me a place in their class 💕

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I139ivzKJzE/sddefault.jpg,0.05157052536760807,0.00014140030820030143,364.7129629629631,0.0010323531760734967,0.051711925675808366,0.05274427885188187,2018-06-06,04:43:17,Wednesday,2,6,38,6,33,54,330,1,76,0,1,4,17,1,0,8.0,8.0,"['ow', 'pers', 'Cray']","['ow', 'pers', 'Cray']",True,"['ow', 'per', 'cray']",3,3,9,0,0,0,0,6.156997831927347,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

Why did the community react to Gun Goddess Miss Fortune with disappointment rather than hype? Why did Riot seem to be apologizing for her quality even before she was released? Why did a cool, badass, fully-featured, high-quality skin end up talked about a low point in the Ultimate skin line?

How did Riot paint themselves into a corner? The same way everyone else does, eventually. Let's talk about that.

Throughout Earth’s history, climate has varied greatly. For hundreds of millions of years, the planet had no polar ice caps. Without this ice, the sea level was 70 meters higher. At the other extreme, about 700 million years ago, Earth became almost entirely covered in ice, during an event known as “Snowball Earth.” What causes these swings in the planet’s climate? Lorraine Lisiecki investigates.

Some things we learned about Rippon: he thinks Grindr is trash.

“You're not looking for love. You're looking for a mistake,” said Rippon.
 
Rippon proceeded to take off his sweater to show how he frames himself, “lip to navel” when posing for Grindr. “I do that so that when they ask for my face pic it's sort of like a treat, you know?” said Rippon.

But Tinder is different. Rippon told VICE News he uses own name on Tinder, “because I fee like Tinder is the classy version of gay online dating.”

Upon review of a fan-generated pie chart of “Which other events is Adam Rippon medaling in,” Rippon acknowledged that he’s not shy to voice his disapproval towards Vice President Mike Pence, or as the pie chart coined it: “Pence-negging,” marked at thirty-three percent, “because my God he's deserved it,” said Rippon. “Just thinking about MP, makes you want to be BM.”

 

Coming in second was “glamazon bitch runway preparedness” at twenty-two percent.

 

“Being an glamazon is a complete full-time job,” said Rippon

 

Watch Rippon show more of his true colors on “Vicepedia.”

About Gringo:
Mild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.
Targeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.
Pursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.
Directed by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.

Shopping for a prom dress is so exciting! I tried on a bunch of different dresses because picking a prom dress is a TOUGH decision. Luckily I had my mom come along and help out, and we texted Brooklyn and Bailey pictures for their input too. Later, we went back to our house, and I tried on some other dresses that my sisters wore for events over the years and my mom's prom dress!

I’m so excited to go to prom as a part of Brooklyn and Bailey’s prom group because they’re graduating soon, and this is one of the last things we can all do together in #HighSchool! Be sure to watch out for my get ready with me prom video next week! Comment below which dress you think I picked!

Let's hop into my AMG GT R and head over to the Mercedes Museum to take a look at the Project One amongst a sea of special cars in an exhibit to celebrate the 50 years of AMG. I can only dream of the upgrade though, however when we jump onto the Autobahns home and stretch the GT R's legs, I certainly am not complaining!

Starting off from Mercedes' offices following a test drive in the GLC 63 S 4matic+ Coupe, we get on the road across Stuttgart to head to the finest collection of Mercedes cars in the world at the Museum. In addition to the AMG models, we could also see significant historic vehicles like the 300 SLR, 300 SL, Uhlenhaut, 2016 F1 car and so much more. It has to be said it is an incredible place to see and thoroughly worth a visit. You can follow the Mercedes-Benz Museum at http://instagram.com/mercedesbenzmuseum

But at Decoy, chef Joe Ng is taking the classic Chinese dish to new heights. Known for its crispy, golden skin and tender meat, Peking duck is typically topped with hoisin and wrapped in thin pancakes. At Decoy, chef Ng has added toppings like sesame-peanut sauce, cranberry, and pico de gallo into the mix, putting a multi-cultural spin on more traditional Chinese fare. Decoy's duck-centric menu is perfect for Chinese-food fans looking to broaden their horizons.

On January 19, 2017, President Barack Obama gave 330 commutations to nonviolent drug offenders, in a final effort to restore what Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates called, “proportionality to unnecessarily long drug sentences.” It was the highest number of clemencies given during the Obama administration, and the most granted on any one day in U.S. history.
Felicia has dealt with struggles that many individuals encounter post-incarceration, like finding employment, reconnecting with family, securing housing and enrolling in school.

VICE News spent time with Felicia to explore what life is like and how she’s been able to adjust and progress after returning home.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IAJkayDjdoE/sddefault.jpg,0.019117832063862392,0.00035354721675314555,54.074339035769825,0.0005128908923597731,0.019471379280615538,0.01998427017297532,2018-05-10,05:21:44,Thursday,3,7,40,7,35,54,350,2,79,0,1,6,19,1,0,7.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.583591534942973,2,"['neutral', 'angry']",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,{'person': 2},2

ABOUT FOR HONOR MARCHING FIRE

Carve a path of destruction through an intense, believable battlefield fighting for guts, glory, and survival in For Honor, the acclaimed melee action game developed by Ubisoft Montreal in collaboration with other Ubisoft studios.

Enter the chaos of a raging war as a bold Knight, brutal Viking, or deadly Samurai, three of the greatest warrior factions of legend. For Honor is a fast-paced and immersive experience, mixing skill with visceral, never-before-seen melee combat. Storm castles in massive battles and confront deadly bosses in the memorable story campaign and support your allies while slaughtering enemies in the groundbreaking multiplayer modes where your combat skills will make the difference between life and death.
Since its release in 2017, For Honor has continued to expand its world with new heroes, modes, and features. Six seasons of content, including regular in-game events, have kept the faction war fresh and exciting. Responding to community feedback, the team worked diligently to build dedicated servers for all multiplayer modes. Since the release of these servers, For Honor has reached best-in-class match completion and eliminated host migration. The recently launched training mode teaches players to master the Art of Battle, For Honor’s completely unique combat system.

For Honor: Marching Fire, coming October 16 2018, is a major update encompassing new heroes, new a PVP mode, unlimited PVE content and a comprehensive graphical update.
Features

NEW HEROES FROM THE FAR EAST – Four warriors from the Wu Lin faction are traveling west after civil war, betrayal and personal tragedies strike close to home. The Jiang Jun, once a feared general, now uses his guandao to wreak havoc on the West. The Nuxia, a bodyguard betrayed by allies, uses her hook swords to slay anyone who stands in her way. The Shaolin, a warrior monk forced to watch his monastery burn, now spreads the gospel with his staff. The Tiandi once sat fourth in line for the throne but was consumed by madness and killed his brothers, ultimately leading to the defeat of his empire. Now, he atones by seeking out the wicked with his broadsword.

BREACH THE CASTLE – Attack and defend a castle in Breach, For Honor’s new strategic 4v4 PvP mode. Attackers must work together to storm the castle gates and kill the Lord of the castle, while defenders must either take down the battering ram or kill all attackers to protect the Lord.

UNLIMITED SINGLE PLAYER CONTENT – A new mode, yet to be revealed, offering unlimited single player and 2-person co-op PVE content.

GRAPHICALLY ENHANCED – Significant graphical enhancements bring you closer to the action than ever before.

Chrissy Metz has gained worldwide fame since starring in This Is Us as Kate Pearson, a 30-something struggling with her body image. Since the series' debut in 2016, the character has been a fan-favorite that many viewers have found incredibly relatable.

From family drama and heartbreaking issues related to her weight, to a failed marriage and financial strain, Metz has gone through a lot over the years. But it's all made her into the stunningly inspirational woman she is today. Here's her real life story...

Practice Notes 42 | Jingle Bells in the Styles of...

Here's a Christmas video for you all.  This time, most of it was not improvised -- I did so to make it continuous from one composer to the next.  Again, this is only a VAGUE representation of these composers, and is by no means meant to be anything more than just for fun.

Nope, not even celebs are immune to the Yanny vs Laurel audio that is tearing apart the internet.

The audio version of “the dress” has the internet shooketh.

It was over 3 years ago that we were cyber feuding over a dress that was either white and gold or blue and black. If you thought “the dress” internet meltdown was an anomaly then you’re one of the only breathing souls that hasn’t heard of “Yanny or Laurel” yet. The color swapping dress now has an audio counterpart. On May 14th YouTuber Cloe Feldman started the Yanny vs Laurel debate on her Insta Story and Twitter writing, “What do you hear?! Yanny or Laurel?”

https://twitter.com/CloeCouture/status/996218489831473152

These two VERY different words have now taken on new meaning. Some swear the clip says Laurel and some swear it says Yanny. And some say they can hear both. Our girl Chrissy Teigen picked sides tweeting, “it’s so clearly laurel. I can’t even figure out how one would hear yanny. It’s Laurel”. She then went so far as to completely mute these now-overused words. Ellen Degeneres retweeted Cloe’s tweet and said, “Literally everything at my show just stopped to see if people hear Laurel or Yanny. I hear Laurel.” But Emmy Rossum was one of the lucky ones that could hear BOTH, “I hear #yanny so clearly… but if I listen closely I can hear a deep quiet ghost saying #laurel...so there”. Football star JJ Watt tweeted our truth, “Yanny vs. Laurel is starting some real fights”.

Internet theorists have decided this audio discrepancy all comes down to frequency. What you hear depends on the amount of bass that’s being produced by the device you’re listening on.

https://twitter.com/earthvessquotes/status/996390813939748864

If you play the clip with low volume there won’t be much bass and you will likely hear Yanny. If you turn the volume up on some speakers that have actual bass then you will probably hear Laurel. This debate explains SO MUCH more than Yanny vs Laurel. All the times your girl said “you hear what you want to hear” may NOT be accurate. Remember- it’s all about the frequency. Okay enough of us- tell us below if you are a Yanny or a Laurel? And do you have ANOTHER theory for this debate? After that check out the best dressed from the Met Gala right here. As always I’m your host Emile Ennis Jr thanks for checking in with Clevver!

Manda's Invisible People interview: Living under a bridge doesn't stop this homeless woman from staying positive  https://youtu.be/xYShiXMGULE

In the video description of the vlog where Manda gives us a tour of her homeless camp in Seattle [https://youtu.be/xYShiXMGULE], I wrote that when Manda and I first met online that I never imagined I'd be having coffee with her under that bridge. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and now I am in awe that I had the honor of taking Manda furniture shopping for her new apartment. We also went out and gave socks to new homeless friends. 

One of the reasons I love Hanes is they genuinely want to help people. Each homeless person that participated in this years campaign, Hanesbrands Inc. offered additional support above the compensation they received for working with the campaign. 

David received first months rent and security deposit for his new apartment and additional funds for furniture when he moved out of a homeless shelter. Hanes paid for Mary's college tuition and bought her a laptop. 

While she was still under the bridge, Hanes paid for Amanda's phone service for a year. It's a miracle that Manda got housing. Manda did all the hard work, and she gets all the credit for getting out of homelessness, but the one tool that helped her the most was the smartphone and mobile services that gave her the ability to contact social services and health services. 

It's truly amazing that Manda is now in housing, but there are tens of thousands of homeless people that still need help. I hope that you'll be encouraged by this video and get a few smiles, but please know getting someone up off the streets is never easy! 

DISCLOSURE: Hanesbrands Inc. compensated me for my time traveling to Seattle to take a formerly homeless woman shopping. This video is independent of that agreement, and Hanes did not compensate Invisible People or me for this video.

About Invisible People: 

Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they’re on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can’t ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation’s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ICdi6W7TUhw/sddefault.jpg,0.03683474992795304,0.0005744018128200168,64.12714776632302,0.009435191289620894,0.037409151740773056,0.04684434303039395,2018-02-22,00:44:26,Thursday,3,11,66,11,51,70,533,0,74,0,2,10,8,3,10,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.834071833512581,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,{'person': 1},1

New School Hip-Hop 6.

Hip-hop has arguably been the best genre of music in the past two decades. As hip-hop maintains its title, a lot has changed about the genre, such as the lyrics. Hip-hop has two phases, old school and new school each of which give off a different vibe. #hiphopuniverse #hiphopcomparisons 

Old School “Hip-Hop” has music based prevalently on African American culture. Artists such as Tupac, Biggie Smalls, and Eazy-E often rap about the struggles of growing up in a racialized environment and the work they put in to get where they are today.

In popular songs such as “Changes” by Tupac and “Juicy” by Biggie Smalls, the artists explain how they went from “negative to positive” as Biggie put it.

Old school hip-hop is still popular today and is regarded as “classic” by many hip-hop fans.

“New school” hip-hop has different types of lyrics. Rappers from today’s generation sing typically about girls, money, and cars they have. Some even sing about how they do drgs, drink alchl, and party which sets a bad example for some listeners. Some of these rappers today did not have it as hard as rappers back in the old days. Also Hip-hop artists now are racially diverse, so African American culture is not necessarily found in music today.

People who grew up listening to Tupac, Biggie, Eazy-E, and so on typically do not enjoy hip-hop in today’s era. Songs written when rap was introduced were lyrically better because rappers were able to tell a story using words that rhyme and flow.

Some songs are also more appealing to fans because they can relate to the struggles their favorite rappers faced.

People of this generation are used to listening to new school hip-hop which is the most played genre on the radio. These same fans reject old school Hip-Hop as a part of the music genre. There are even rappers who know nothing about the most influential Hip-Hop artists.

Growing up listening to Eminem has caused me to fall in love with him as an artist. He introduced me to Hip-Hop. But I noticed a change in the music industry. Artists wanted to be part of the mainstream industry and they had to change their music to fit into the mainstream category.

Because of new artists in hip-hop, many lessen known artists are rarely noticed. These artists are said to be “underground.” Underground rappers usually do not make it big because they have music related to the messages embodied by old school hip-hop artists would say.

Some people think old school Hip-Hop is better than new school Hip-Hop. And there are many people who prefer underground Hip-Hop to mainstream Hip-Hop. What do you think?

Its soundtrack is a mix of 80s pop, classical compositions & songs by singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, including two songs written specifically for the film.

Listen to the full soundtrack: https://soundtracks.lnk.to/CallMeByYourName

While the soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a compilation of tracks by numerous musicians, Guadagnino decided he wanted to approach American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens to create a song especially for the film. “An artist for whom I have enormous admiration is Sufjan. His voice is fantastic and angelic, and his lyrics are so sharp and deep and full of sorrow and beauty. The music is so haunting. All these elements were the ones I wanted to envision in the film.”

While Guadagnino knew that Stevens had never collaborated on a movie before, he reached out. Stevens read the book, they had a long conversation, and the result was that he wrote not one, but two original songs for the film: “Mystery of Love” and “Visions of Gideon”.

The soundtrack for CALL ME BY YOUR NAME also includes tracks by John Adams and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as pieces written by Erik Satie, Maurice Ravel and Johann Sebastian Bach. As the film is set in the 1980s, Guadagnino chose period Italian pop music (including Giorgio Moroder & Joe Esposito’s “Lady Lady Lady”) for the radio, but particularly spotlights The Psychedelic Furs’ anthem “Love My Way”. “I love The Psychedelic Furs,” says Guadagnino. “It’s kind of autobiographical, because I remember listening to that song when I was seventeen and being completely affected by it. I wanted to pay homage to myself then.”

LYRICS
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
'Til I breathe my last breath
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

But very few of them will see ground combat. That's because the war is being fought mainly by Afghan soldiers on the ground, supported by U.S. airpower in the form of drones or F-16s.

VICE NEWS spent time with U.S. and Afghan forces as they try to beat back a Taliban resurgence that's seen the group now control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the beginning of the war. We accompanied an Afghan-led counter-insurgency operation deep into Helmand province, where local forces fight day and night to push the Taliban back using heavy artillery and mine-clearance teams that dig out IEDs with their bare hands.

As top U.S. officials laud recent results on the battlefield, Afghan soldiers say the Taliban they’re fighting is stronger now than they’ve been in years.

I share a little information about how to change your life & be happier through manifestation & visualisation. Years ago I used to visual my life completely unaware of what manifestation was. I have come to find that during my early 20's I lived a happier and more content life compared to the last few years where I stopped positively visualising my life. I started to become more anxious and spend my time worrying about the future and thinking everything would end up a disaster and my overall happiness dwindled. I miss feeling happy and content and I miss visualisation. I enjoy the time when I get to imagine my life the way I want and I miss how it would make me feel. I am learning to visual in a more positive way and I've already noticed a difference in my mood. I'm excited to learn this skill again and excited to get through 2018 feeling happier and more positive.

For timeline purposes, I am currently 27 and I was my most happiest from 19-23 and then 23-27 has been difficult and a struggle with anxiety. I've been working on my anxiety and I feel like Im really getting a grasp on it. I feel anxious less and less and Im enjoying life more and more and I hope to share how I did this with you.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IHYj2hfPYos/sddefault.jpg,0.01785842617713573,0.0003216127323983288,55.52773375594296,0.0007385370035581277,0.018180038909534055,0.018918575913092185,2018-03-14,05:27:21,Wednesday,2,9,40,9,35,64,349,2,79,0,1,8,19,1,0,6.0,8.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.743226796079887,2,"['neutral', 'neutral']",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"{'tie': 1, 'person': 2}",3

the dip in the pot is my favourite ( weird swedish dish ) but i'm also so looking forward to david's chocolate fudge, the mandarins, the fig chutney, the crisp bread. the vegan cheese, prince sausages and meat balls. the vegan christmas ham. the kale salad and the roasted brussels sprout. the jansson's delight, and the pickled aubergine in vegan caviar sauce. i mean the list goes on and on, i could just keep on typing. so let's stop before i drool all over myself, i'm wearing a white shirt after all.

xmas food is of course normally incredibly rich and not so high in nutrients, so i've found a way to balance it out with lots of fresh fruit and veg to keep my body from going under. balance is a good word this time of year, don't you think ?

YouTube royalty, and his eponymous show is a paradigm-shifting mix of news and opinion tackling everything from politics, to celebrity gossip, to the crypto-currency boom. But what does a decade-plus on the platform mean if he can't handle his spicy wings?! By popular demand (i.e., an insane amount of comments demanding his presence at the table), Philly D finally steps into the Hot Ones terror dome to go head to head with our bald protagonist, Sean Evans. As they fend off the Scoville onslaught, the duo gets into the weeds of YouTube history, unpackages the problems with contemporary media, and reveals photographic evidence of a bygone era when Sean actually had a six pack. And that's not all—with the weight of YouTube on his back, DeFranco boldly sets out to go where no guest has gone before. Don't miss this piece of Hot Ones history.

We will discuss her humble beginnings in The Bronx, New York, and her Carribean roots. We will also shed light on her rise to fame, and who she has to thank for investing in her rap career. We'll give you a hint, no one but herself! Of course, the list wouldn’t be complete without some deets about her relationship and pregnancy with Migos member Offset.

Paige was teaming with Mandy Rose & Sonya Deville against Sasha Banks, Bayley & Mickie James.

It is believed that she had just suffered a mild stinger from the kick.

The start of the video shows Paige taking a kick to the back from Banks. Paige struggled to get to her feet before falling to the mat, causing the referee to throw up the ""X"" injury signal and stop the match. A stretcher was brought out, however Paige was able to walk to the back with the help of the doctors.

Some send flowers, some send kind words, but leave it to Cardi B to give thanks in the form of anatomical favors. 

After taking home practically the entire Grammy trophy inventory last night, Bruno Mars just further goes to show that he is a one-of-a-kind legendary force to be reckoned with, and personally one of my favorite artists of ALL TIME. So when you’re asked to be featured on one of his very own tracks, the least you could do is offer up an entire body part, you know, just as a little ‘thank you’ in return.

That’s exactly what Cardi B did after last night’s Grammy awards when she took to Instagram following their show-stopping performance of “Finesse” to thank him for allowing her vocals to be featured on his track. She posted a photo of the performance with the caption writing QUOTE, “@brunomars i want to thank you Soo much! I don’t even know how! maybe one day you’ll need a kidney. I got you. Congrats on your Wins tonight you deserve I.T.You sing, dance play instrument ,produce your videos SHIT you probably know how to build a house .You ARE AMAZING ...and you gave me rhythm.”    

Although she didn’t win any awards this time around, last night’s Grammys not only marked Cardi’s first time on the Grammy stage, but her first time at the Grammys EVER, so it will without question be one she holds near and dear to her heart. And not only has Cardi been making waves as a new artist in the industry, but an artist one who is also never afraid to speak her mind and consistently stays true to herself. She recently sat down with Zendaya, where the two chatted about their greatest fears, and staying true to their roots during an eye-opening interview that’ll make you feel #RELATABLE. 

The two first touched on the topic of their fears, to which Z revealed QUOTE, “Sometimes, as a young person in this industry, I put a lot of pressure on myself to do the right thing. I think this is a flaw of mine. I get so afraid to make the wrong decisions, but I have to understand that I'm only 21 years old. I'm not going to always be perfect. You cannot let the fear of not being perfect stop you from doing anything at all.”

But most importantly, despite all their fast rise to fame, both Zendaya and Cardi haven’t forgotten where they came from. While talking to Zendaya, Cardi said QUOTE, “To me, you seem so angelic. You know, you are the Disney star. You seem like such a sweetheart. But…I know you're from Oakland. My best friend is from Oakland, and she's hood as f-ck. That b--ch is a f--king gangster. Do you think that you got some hood in you?” to which Zendaya responded, “Absolutely, there is definitely ‘hood’ in me and it will never leave. It's part of who I am, as it is part of my family. My aunties held Black Panther party meetings in the downstairs basement of our house that I grew up in. You learn so much from those experiences and from those stories.”
It looks like we can all learn a little something from these two and I love how they keep it so real, but right now I gotta know what you guys thought about Cardi’s thank-you message to Bruno and her interview with Zendaya, so get to talking down here in the comments, and after that, click right over here for a full rundown of Bruno and Cardi’s performance of “Finesse” from last night’s Grammys.

MGMT are: Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser. The two met in 2001 and began producing electronic music in their freshman year of university. They bonded over a love of neo-psychedelia from the 1970s and 80s, bands like Chrome, Spacemen 3 and Spiritualized. The pair started creating loops of sounds and noise in their dorm rooms. They didn’t start singing over their tracks until they started writing pop songs. The idea of pop-music was a joke to these two, it’s why they initially called themselves “The Management,” it was a stab at the corporate side of the music industry. They were in charge.

This video essay covers MGMT's entire discography from Oracular Spectacular to Congratulations to their self-titled and even to their forthcoming release, Little Dark Age. The group have been trying to shed their past personas that gave, ""Kids,"" ""Time to Pretend,"" and ""Electric Feel"" to the world. They've yet to replicate the successes of those singles, but by choice.

I used a clip from the excellent podcast, Song Exploder. They host artists and have them break down their tracks:

Out of all the DC movies slated to hit theaters over the course of the next few years, the one that seems to have the most people excited is the Ben Affleck-fronted solo Batman movie. It's not hard to understand why, since Affleck completely stole the show with his appearances in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice as well as Suicide Squad, so it only makes sense to give audiences more of the fan favorite character.

That being said, concrete details about the upcoming Batman solo film have been incredibly difficult to come by. We've gone through all of the released news and rumors about the upcoming project to bring you everything we know so far about the latest chapter in the long cinematic history of The Dark Knight. Now let's get the ball rolling with the question that's at the forefront of everyone's minds.

At this point, no official release date for the currently untitled Batman solo film has been released by Warner Bros, and we have very little evidence to indicate where it could potentially fall on the upcoming DC slate. With the multiple shakeups and changes that have gone on behind the scenes at Warner Bros. throughout the course of 2016, we wouldn't even find ourselves remotely surprised to see yet another shuffling of the slate at some point in the near future to either delay or move up the possible release of the Batman solo movie. All we know for sure about the film's current timeline is the fact that Joe Manganiello recently came out and admitted that everyone involved has decided to take their time; in his words: ""the movie will start shooting whenever those pieces are in place.""

Shortly after most people came to the collective realization that Ben Affleck's Batman represented one of the best aspects of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, Warner Bros. set about getting him much more involved creatively in the greater DCEU. The studio eventually revealed that Ben Affleck and Geoff Johns had been collaborating on a script for the upcoming Batman solo movie, with Affleck also set to direct. However, that all shifted earlier this year when Affleck officially dropped out as the director of the project to focus on acting in the project and Planet of the Apes' Matt Reeves was subsequently brought onboard.

Matt Reeves has asserted that everything is going ""really well"" behind the scenes, and he is apparently very excited to bring this story to life on the big screen. This reassurance is essential, as the solo Batman movie has hit its own fair share of speed bumps through its development over the course of the last few years. The most prominent hurdle came when Ben Affleck stepped down as the director of the project, resulting in the eventual search to find Matt Reeves and lock him in place. Now the project appears to have found its footing (though rumors of a possible Batman recasting - Jake Gyllenhaal as the new Batman? - continue to surface), and Reeves is taking his time to make sure that he gets it right.

There was never really a doubt about 13 Reasons Why getting a second season.

What will 13 Reasons Why Season 2 be about?
The show will pick ""up in the aftermath of Hannah Baker's death,"" according to Netflix, ""and the start of the characters' complicated journeys toward healing and recovery."" Yeah, that's very vague and open-ended, but the good news is we have some ideas on what all that could look like, and those involved with the show haven't been shy about speculating. Said Brian d'Arcy James, Hannah's onscreen dad: ""There's certainly a lot more road to be traveled in terms of where the Bakers go from here... in terms of having to deal with that loss, deal with that grief, and channel it and try to make peace with it -- or not."" In light of the Sonya casting development above, it seems safe to bet on a new legal subplot expanding.

Showrunner Brian Yorkey has hinted we could see different perspectives of past storylines. ""There are other people who might want to tell [Hannah's story] differently or who are players in that story who might have a different perspective on some of those events,"" he said at a recent Netflix panel. ""Season 2 will see us look at a lot of the events that we think we know how they went down and maybe learn they're more complicated than first we thought, and that Hannah herself is even more complicated than we saw in Season 1."" 

And a number of present-day cliffhangers need to be resolved, including those involving Mr. Porter, the school counselor who had a chance to save Hannah on the last day of her life; Jessica, Hannah's ex-best friend who's recovering from her rape; Bryce, the jock whose confession of assault looks poised to ruin him; Justin and Tyler, both of whom leave Season 1 with guns; Sheri, who dodges the consequences of her actions; Clay, who rekindles his friendship with Skye; and, most importantly, Alex, who's fighting for his life.

Why would a dead girl lie? 13 Reasons Why is now streaming only on Netflix. Based on the best-selling books by Jay Asher, the Netflix Original Series 13 Reasons Why follows Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) as he returns home from school to find a mysterious box with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker—his classmate and crush—who tragically committed suicide two weeks earlier. On tape, Hannah explains that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Will Clay be one of them? 13 Reasons Why comes from executive producers Tom McCarthy, Brian Yorkey, Selena Gomez, Joy Gorman and Kristel Laiblin.

Ever since Prince Harry proposed to actress Meghan Markle, it seems like everyone wants to know as much about her as possible. We've all seen her face before because of her starring role on Suits, but who is she really? What was she like before she became a Royal bride-to-be? If you want to know more, make sure to watch our video on 20 Things You Didn't Know About Meghan Markle.

If you didnt already know, Meghan is a huge feminist. However, we had know idea that shes been fighting for womens rights since she was just eleven years old. After being outraged by a sexist dish soap commercial on T.V., Meghan penned a letter to First Lady Hillary Clinton. But youll have to keep watching to see if Meghans little voice was able to make a difference back then. 

Did you know that Ellen DeGeneres was the one who convinced Meghan to adopt her first rescue dog? She didnt know Ellen back then but they just happened to bump into each other at the dog rescue shelter. Meghan ended up bring Bogart home that day because when Ellen tells you to rescue a dog, you rescue a dog. 

From being a suitcase model on Deal or No Deal to being best friends with Serena Williams, theres a lot that you just don't know about Meghan. Make sure to keep watching until the end to see why marrying Prince Harry is going to be a huge transition for Meghan's acting career.

안녕하세요 오늘은 민트 초콜릿 마카롱을 준비했어요 
제가 프렌치 머랭으로만 자주 만들어서 오늘은 이탈리안 머랭으로 준비했습니다

이탈리안 머랭이 번거로워 자주 만들지 않습니다 오랜만에 만드려니 어색하네요 희희
민트 초콜릿을 가운데 넣어 더 맛있게! 초코맛을 더 진하게 하고싶다면 안에 버터크림 말고 가나슈를 샌드해주세요 아주 달달한 디저트가 될겁니다 :-)

▶재료 (30개 분량)
+ 페이스트
아몬드가루 150g, 슈가파우더 150g, 흰자 55g

+ 이탈리안 머랭
설탕 150g, 물 40g, 흰자 55g, 식용색소

+ 민트 초콜릿 버터크림
버터 200g, 코코아가루 30g, 다크초콜릿 70g, 슈가파우더 120g, 민트익스트랙 약간

+ 기타
민트 초콜릿

1) 페이스트 재료들을 볼에 담아 잘 섞어줍니다 (가루류는 체치기)
2) 섞은 페이스트는 마르지 않게 덮어둡니다
3) 다른 볼에 머랭을 만들 흰자를 담아두고 냄비에 물과 설탕을 넣고 약불에 올려줍니다
4) 온도계로 체크하며 시럽이 100도가 넘어가면 흰자 휘핑을 시작합니다
5) 시럽이 118도가 되면 어느정도 휘핑이 되어있는 머랭에 부어가며 계속 휘핑합니다
6) 뿔이 구부러지지만 모양은 유지되는 머랭이 완성되었으면 색소를 넣고 섞어줍니다
7) 완성한 머랭 반정도를 페이스트와 섞어줍니다
8) 나머지 머랭도 넣고 섞어줍니다 (반죽의 농도를 체크 영상 확인)
9) 완성한 반죽을 짤주머니에 담아줍니다 (원형 깍지 0.7~1.0cm)
10) 팬 위에 반죽을 짜주고 건조시켜줍니다 (손에 묻어나지 않을 때 까지)
11) 건조가 거의 다 되면 오븐을 150도로 예열해주고 반죽을 구워줍니다 (150도 13~15분)
12) 구운 마카롱 꼬끄는 식혀주고 버터크림을 만들어줍니다
13) 볼에 버터와 코코아가루를 넣고 휘핑합니다
14) 녹인 다크 초콜릿을 넣고 섞어줍니다
15) 슈가 파우더를 넣고 밝은 색이 나도록 오래 휩해줍니다
16) 취향에 맞게 민트 익스트랙을 넣고 섞어줍니다
17) 크림을 짤주머니에 담아 마카롱 꼬끄에 짜고 준비한 민트 초콜릿을 올려 샌드합니다
18) 하루정도 냉장실에 넣어 숙성시키면 속이 좀 더 쫀득하고 맛있습니다
- 민트 맛이 싫다면 민트 익스트랙과 민트 초콜릿을 제외시킵니다 
- 민트 좋아하시는 분들이라면 민트 익스트랙을 영상보다 더 넣어주세요 
(제가 민트를 좋아하는 편도 아니고 싫어하지도 않는데 먹기 딱 좋았어요)
- 오래 두고 드신다면 냉동보관 해주세요 
- 버터크림 만들 때 충분히 휘핑을 해주세요 (아니면 느끼하고 별로입니다)
- 버터크림은 개당 너무 많이만 샌드 하지 않으면 30개 딱 맞게 나옵니다 

※ 가염, 가당 등이 붙지 않으면 무가당생크림, 무염버터를 사용하시면 됩니다
시청해주셔서 감사합니다

I HATE SHAKESPHERE AND GOSLING
AND CAKES WITH WHITE FROSTING
TWO NAMES IN A HEART-SHAPED TATTOO
I THNK CUPID IS STUPID
AND VIOLETS ARE PURPLE NOT BLUE

I HATE CATCHING BOUQUETS
THE HONEYMOON PHASE
AND LETTERMAN JACKETS DON’T FIT
YOUR EYES CAN’T HOLD STARS
AND YOU’LL DIE IF YOUR HEART REALLY SKIPPED

I HATE LOVE SONGS
YEAH I REALLY DO
I HATE LOVE SONGS
BUT I LOVE YOU

I HATE PINK CARDS WITH GLITTER
AND VALENTINES DINNER
AND ROSES JUST DIE IN A WEEK
WE WERE DRUNK WHEN WE MET
SO WE DON’T KNOW OUR ANNIVERSARY
WHOOPS

OH AND I’M FAR TOO VAIN
TO KISS IN THE RAIN
THE CLOUDS, THEY AREN’T NUMBERED TONIGHT
AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL SOMETHING
BUT IT SURE AS HELL AIN’T BUTTERFLIES
NO

I HATE LOVE SONGS
YEAH I REALLY DO
I HATE LOVE SONGS
BUT I LOVE YOU
OH YEAH

CAUSE I HATE LOVE SONGS
YEAH I REALLY DO
I HATE LOVE SONGS
BUT I LOVE YOU
YEAH

I HATE LOVE SONGS
THE OLD AND THE NEW
I HATE LOVE SONGS
BUT I LOVE YOU

As the battle over Catalan independence hits crisis levels, AJ+’s Dena Takruri hangs out with Catalan soccer fans, for whom stadiums are a symbolic battleground over the future of this region.

Gigantic moving cities now roam the Earth, ruthlessly preying upon smaller traction towns.  Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan)—who hails from a Lower Tier of the great traction city of London—finds himself fighting for his own survival after he encounters the dangerous fugitive Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar).  Two opposites, whose paths should never have crossed, forge an unlikely alliance that is destined to change the course of the future.

Mortal Engines is the startling, new epic adventure directed by Oscar®-winning visual-effects artist Christian Rivers (King Kong).  Joining Rivers are The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies three-time Academy Award®-winning filmmakers Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who have penned the screenplay.  The Universal and MRC adaptation is from the award-winning book series by Philip Reeve, published in 2001 by Scholastic.

On board as producers are Zane Weiner (The Hobbit trilogy), Amanda Walker (The Hobbit trilogy) and Deborah Forte (Goosebumps), as well as Walsh and Jackson.  Ken Kamins (The Hobbit trilogy) joins Boyens as executive producer.  Universal will distribute the film worldwide.  www.mortalengines.com

This weekend, we’ll be seeing the season finale of Power Rangers Ninja Steel and next year we’ll be ushering in Power Rangers Ninja Super Steel for its iconic 25th Anniversary. That’s right, Power Rangers has been around for a quarter century. Many surprises for the franchise are in store for longtime fans, but one rumor that keeps popping up is the return of Jason David Frank for the 25 Anniversary episode. If JDF is involved in the anniversary he’s been keeping pretty quiet, but he did mention something to us at New York Comic-Con that caught our attention.

Lyrics

There was a time when I tried to hold the ocean in my fists – when I mistook the language for
the light. There was a tightness that gripped my soul and bubbled at my wrists, and choked me
within inches of my life. But now I’m letting go, and I can finally breathe – I can finally breathe.
And my hands are open, reaching out – I’m learning how to live with doubt – I’m learning how to
lean into the grey. ‘Cause I’ve had enough of black and white – I’ll find another way – and I will
lean into the grey. I’ll lean into the grey. There was a time when I tried to bind and bottle up the
sea – I tried to hide my heart inside my head. There was a maze of these vicious lines that cut
through everything – I pulled against them till my body bled. I will find another way – and I will
lean into the grey.

IUMTaAQ43lY,dDZoGcQVjJg,Tom Misch: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,NPR Music,10.0,2018-06-08 09:00:03+00:00,"['NPR', 'NPR Music', 'National Public Radio', 'Live', 'Performance']",9780759.0,122565.0,1817.0,4123.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUMTaAQ43lY/default.jpg,"June 1, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- I learned a few things while watching Tom Misch perform at the Tiny Desk that should've been obvious to a longtime fan like me: He produces beats with a live audience in mind. As much as his drums slap, guitar is the foundation for most of his songs and he showcases a burgeoning talent on the instrument throughout his set.

I first caught wind of this UK wunderkind in 2014. Crafting his own instrumental projects and remixing tracks by artists ranging from Busta Rhymes to Lianne La Havas, Misch steadily garnered a dedicated following on SoundCloud. From there, he collaborated with other London artists and released EPs of original music on the platform. Misch's style doesn't revel in what's going on in pop music today; like a handful of other artists from the UK, his interpretation of hip-hop and R&B is a continuation of what the greats who came before him started. A healthy dose of that inspiration is drawn from the late J. Dilla, while Misch's up-tempo dance numbers align him with the Kaytranadas of the world. In 2016, Misch — still just 21 years old at the time — decided to dabble more in songwriting and explore that soothing timbre of his voice on Reverie, and all of a sudden, his potential rose exponentially.

Misch and the band arrived bright and early to get situated behind the Tiny Desk and rehearse. Misch has said before that he isn't a jazz purist intrinsically, but the way he opens up a guitar solo or jams with saxophonist Braxton Cook, jazz music certainly runs through him.

If you haven't heard of Tom Misch before this performance, now's a good time to catch up. Check out his breakthrough album, Geography, as well as his earlier collaborations, then come back and watch his Tiny Desk again for a true appreciation of his growth as an artist.

COMMENT RULES: 
1) No number spam (as in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc). This is annoying and usually has NOTHING to do with the video. Also no ""I'M EARLY"" jokes. Those, again, have nothing to do with the video and are rarely constructive. Or comment spam, like ""Legend has it nobody can like this comment!"" 
2) No advertising your channel or giveaways. That's not the right way to get viewers. 
3) Don't be offensive. I'm keeping this one vague for a reason. Keep everything PG-rated, not even PG-13. 
4) Don't spoil movies that just came out in theaters (as in, within a one month window). 
5) Treat others with respect. 
6) No political discussion, please. I'll remove any comments that break these rules. This is NOT because I'm an advocate for censorship, but rather because I like this to be a family friendly channel.

That sounds like a choice."" Kanye appears to be feeling affected by the backlash that ensued during and after the interview, and interrupts his phone call with Kim to have a heart-to-heart- with our videographer. When asked if he's worried about the threats against him, Kanye says, ""Nah... we love everybody, it's all love, really."" He then bonds with the videographer over them both being fathers, telling him that his ""role in society is important,"" before ending the interview with a hug!

Andre Black Nerd Review of Ready Player One. Ready Player One Movie Review featuring a lot of video game characters and 80's nostalgia. But does Ready Player One rely too much on nostalgia and references or could have even done more with pop culture and geek culture? Ready Player One is directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the book by Ernest Cline who is also the screenwriter with Zak Penn. Starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Lena Waithe, Mark Rylance, Simon Pegg, and Ben Mendelsohn.

In this session, her only mistake was a fall on the first triple axel, but all other jumps were landed solid on one foot. She even did a reverse back-scratch spin as part of her warmup.

She has returned to a 3-turn entrance for the triple flip in her 3/3 combo, and it looks much more stable. It's also nice to see her relaxing and emoting a bit during the performance; I hope it continues into the competition. She is in great shape and seems to be peaking at the right time. GO MIRAI GO!

The film, written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, focuses on a cover-up that spanned four U.S. Presidents and pushed the country’s first female newspaper publisher and a hard-driving editor to join an unprecedented battle between journalist and government.

Perri Nemiroff is here to give you her review of this film that was inspired by true events. She looks at the acting, direction, story and overall impact of the film. She also lets you know if this is another Hanks/Spielberg collaboration that may generate some awards buzz this season.

Then step inside the Betway Stadium Store Spree – the only store in East London that has a West Ham fan season ticket on its shelves for one lucky fan!

We've revived the beloved nineties game show 'Supermarket Sweep', but with a very special Hammers-themed twist.

Dressed in a suit that the legendary Dale Winton would be proud of, Snapchat star Stevo The Mad Man plays the role of host, as Mark Noble, Michail Antonio and Aaron Cresswell help three lifelong West Ham supporters battle it out for the star prize.

Will the fans’ shopping trip be a successful one? Watch part two of the hilarious two-part video to find out!

http://blog.betway.com/football/west-ham/stevo-the-madman-and-west-ham-revive-supermarket-sweep/

How the game works:

- Stevo asks three rounds of football-themed questions to Mark, Michail and Aaron, who must answer as many as possible to earn their team-mate time on the clock to complete their shopping.

- Once the question rounds have been completed, the fans must head onto the shop floor and find all the items on the list given to them by Stevo, plus any bonus items.

- With a West Ham player as their personal shopper, the fan with the most items will then play for the prize of a lifetime: a West Ham season ticket!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZQfPepf6a0/sddefault.jpg,0.01068246253543945,0.0001012555690562981,105.5,0.00025313892264074525,0.010783718104495748,0.011036857027136492,2017-12-14,14:51:50,Thursday,3,11,34,11,34,63,273,2,58,0,1,6,23,3,1,5.0,7.0,[],[],False,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.632729615344666,1,['happy'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"{'book': 1, 'tie': 1, 'person': 1}",3

CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM RECIPE

Ingredients

1 Cup | 2 Sticks | 220g Butter
5 Cups | 625g Icing Sugar | Powdered Sugar | Confectioners Sugar
½ Cup | 50g Cocoa Powder
½ Cup - 1 Cup | 125ml - 250ml Milk
1 tsp Vanilla Essence

Instructions

In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl if you are using a hand mixer add the room temperature butter. Beat on high speed for about 5 minutes until the butter is soft and almost doubled in volume.
Add the sugar in thirds, beating in between until completely incorporated. With the last third of the sugar add in the cocoa powder.
The buttercream will be very thick at this point, turn the mixer to low speed and stream in half a cup of milk.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add more milk if you would like a thinner consistency.
Add in the vanilla essence and beat for a further 2 minutes.
Pipe onto your cupcakes or use to decorate your cakes.

Drake Gods Plan Lyrics

Lyrics in a nutshell:

Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don’t pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don’t wanna die for them to miss me
Guess I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't (ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down a G.O.D. (yeah, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (yeah, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat
And still

Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah, ayy, ayy

She say, ""Do you love me?"" I tell her, ""Only partly""
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
50 dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the 02 into the 03, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broski's

God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own (ayy, no, ayy)
Someone watching this shit close (yep, close)
I've been me since Scarlett Road (ayy, road, ayy)
Might go down as G.O.D. (ayy, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (ayy, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat
And still

Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IbVC2jLOSsc/sddefault.jpg,0.01883824811910381,0.0004951844212653742,38.04289333449813,0.00036722464856484336,0.019333432540369188,0.01970065718893403,2018-01-30,18:21:07,Tuesday,1,11,21,11,13,53,147,3,28,0,0,9,2,2,0,4.0,6.0,"[""GOD'S PLAN""]","[""GOD'S"", 'PLAN']",True,"['god', ""'S"", 'plan']",3,3,9,0,1,1,0,4.722196265871276,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{},0
